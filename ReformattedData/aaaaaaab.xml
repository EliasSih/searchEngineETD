The main goal of this study was to find the conditions for sun drying that maximise the throughput while minimising quality loss. A whole-bed approach was taken to investigate the conditions of the grain and the air at different layers during the drying process. Seven sets of sun-drying experiments were conducted in Cambodia using a range of methods practiced by rice farmers. These methods included drying with different bed depths (2 to 6 cm), with the bed on different pads (water-proof tarpaulin, mat, net, polystyrene or rice husk), and with different bed tempering methods (stirring regularly or shading and/or covering the bed around midday) for four Cambodian rice varieties (Pka Knhey, CAR11, Masary and IR66). The grain temperature was found to be more affected by the solar intensity than the temperature of the ambient air. Fastest drying was achieved when the bed was thin, less compacted, stirred regularly but not shaded or covered around midday, dried on a pad which allows some air and moisture movement and with high or strong solar intensity. Only the mechanical impact (MI) and milling tests of the rice quality provided useful results. Higher quality was found for grain that was dried in thin beds, stirred regularly, shaded with or without covering around midday and dried on pads with less air circulation. Among the methods used to determine the glass transition temperature of the grain, only the Differential Scanning Calorimetry method gave meaningful results. The glass transition temperature data were highly variable but generally decreased with increasing moisture content and compared quite well with the published glass transition temperatures for other varieties of rice. To provide additional detail on the local conditions within the bed, to better understand the drying process and the interactions between variables and to predict alternative parameters that might be used to correlate with the head rice yields (HRYs), a mathematical model for heat and moisture transport within the bed was developed. The model covered all the drying methods/conditions studied experimentally. A lumped parameter approach to energy and mass transfer in individual kernels was used in the bed model. The model was validated against experimental data. The predicted drying time, temperatures, moisture contents and water activities (relative humidity of the air within the bed) were found to compare very well with the experimental data except when a polystyrene pad was used. The model proved to be a very good mechanistic tool with advantages of simplicity and practical accuracy in the design and management of the sun drying system. A number of parameters related to postulated grain damage mechanisms were derived from the predicted conditions within the bed during drying. The best predictors of the grain quality were found to be rewetting the kernels when the grain is bulked (especially when the kernels are partly below and partly above critical moisture content) grain temperature and distance from the glass transition temperature line. It was concluded that in order to get the fastest drying conditions rice should be sun dried with thin bed, stirring, not shaded or covered around midday and dried on a pad with air circulation. For the highest quality grain, that is grain which would have the least breakage during milling, rice should be sun dried with a thin bed, stirring, shaded or covered around midday and dried on a pad with less air circulation. The optimal drying conditions to get the best quality combined with the fastest practical drying rate, the drying conditions should be drying with 2 cm bed depth, stirring the grain bed every hour, shading or covering the bed around midday and using a tarpaulin or net pad placed directly on the ground.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rice</field><field name="subject">sun drying</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300304 Post harvest technologies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/620</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconstructing debris transport pathways on constructional ridges : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Quaternary Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mandolla, Stephanie</field><field name="description">It is generally accepted that Mt Ruapehu, Tongariro National Park, New Zealand, was heavily glaciated during the Pleistocene. Eight small glaciers can still be found on the summit of this active volcano. However, the glaciers have been retreating at a fast rate during the last few centuries. The scientific community has placed its main focus on the volcanic aspects of the region. Although most authors refer to the landforms that appear to be of glacial origin as &#8216;moraines&#8217;, no actual glacial studies have been undertaken so far to provide the necessary evidence that is needed to support this hypothesis. The aim of this study is to use established field techniques in glacial geomorphology to (1) identify the extent of glacial deposits using diagnostic criteria and (2) to reconstruct the transport pathways of the Wahianoa Glacier. Four main diagnostic criteria have been used: clast morphology, macrofabrics, grain size distribution and the surface texture of grains. The Wahianoa valley has a very pronounced U-shape and is likely to be of glacial origin. The valley consists of two elongate debris ridges that are made out of unconsolidated, poorly sorted diamict of varying lithologies. This study has identified that the activity and the composition of the volcano has lead to complex glacial processes. Glacial ice has advanced over a deformable bed and the glacier itself was probably extensively covered by supraglacial debris. The area has been identified as a pre-historic pathway for lahars and the volcano erupts frequently to produce fresh volcanic deposits. As the active vent has changed its position during the eruptive history of the volcano, the quantity and the location of the source rock that fed the glacier has varied greatly. This study is an initial attempt at unfolding the glacial history of Mt Ruapehu. This is based on field analysis of glacigenic sediments, rather than topographic and aerial photo analysis. The results show great complexity and the potential for further studies of other moraine systems on Mt Ruapehu.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glaciology</field><field name="subject">geomorphology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260115 Glaciology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parental resistance : mobile and transitory discourses : a discursive analysis of parental resistance towards medical treatment for a seriously ill child : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Woods, Martin</field><field name="description">This qualitative thesis uses discourse analysis to examine parental resistance towards medical treatment of critically ill children. It is an investigation of the &#8216;mobile and transitory&#8217; discourses at play in instances of resistance between parents, physicians and nurses within health care institutions, and an examination of the consequences of resistance through providing alternative ways of perceiving and therefore understanding these disagreements. The philosophical perspectives, methodology and methods used in this thesis are underpinned by selected ideas taken from the works of Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu and supported by relevant literature in the fields of media, law, children, parenting, caring, serious childhood illness, medicine and nursing. The thesis obtains information from a variety of texts that includes established literature (such as medical, sociological, legal, academic and philosophical), newspaper articles, radio or television interviews, internet sources, court reports and proceedings, legal experts and other commentators &#8211; and 15 interview based texts, where the focus is on analyses of narratives of parents, doctors and nurses. In the texts gathered for this thesis, there are noticeable differences between the personal experience discourses of parents, the &#8216;in-between&#8217; discourses of nurses, and the disciplined discourses of physicians. This thesis brings these discourses into conversation with each other suggesting that parental resistance does not occur because of an infrequent and unusual set of circumstances where a few socially isolated and/or &#8216;difficult&#8217; parents disagree with the treatment desires of paediatric physicians. Instead, it is argued that from an examination of interview based texts, parental resistance is an omnipresent but transitory occurrence that affects many of the interactions between the parents of seriously ill children and clinical staff. It is maintained that within these interactions, the seeds of this resistance are sown in both critical decision making situations and in everyday occurrences between doctors, nurses and parents within healthcare institutions. Contributing factors to parental resistance include the use of power games by staff, the language of medicine, forms of symbolic violence, the presence or absence of trust between parents and medical staff, the effects of medical habitus, and challenges to the parental role and identity. Overall, it is proposed in this thesis that parents who resist treatment for their seriously ill child are not exceptions to the normative patient-physician relationship. Instead an analysis of their discourses and practices is able to illuminate the complex interactions between patients and medical conventions. It is therefore possible to see parents who resist medical advice not as peripheral to the medical encounter but as examples of how patient-physician relationships come to be codified, constructed and crafted through everyday discourses and practices within health care settings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parents</field><field name="subject">parent-doctor</field><field name="subject">seriously ill child</field><field name="subject">pediatric care</field><field name="subject">resistance</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/622</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Everyday spirituality : supporting the spiritual experience of young children in three early childhood educational settings : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bone, Jane Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The focus of this research is the spiritual experience of young children in early childhood educational settings. Spirituality is included in the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, Te Whariki, but is a relatively unarticulated aspect of educational practice. In order to find out how spirituality is supported in early childhood educational contexts this qualitative case study research took place in three early childhood settings: a Montessori casa, a private preschool and a Steiner (Waldorf) kindergarten. The methods used in the research included participant observation, interviews and focus groups. The teachers were asked to make a video about spirituality to reflect their own context and photographs were taken in each setting. The metaphor of spiritual landscape is used in this research. In this landscape everyday experience merged with the spiritual to form the concept of everyday spirituality. The cultural theories of everyday life supported a realisation that ordinary daily activity can become wonderful and mysterious when the spiritual dimension is realised. The themes that emerged from analysis of the case studies are conceptualised as transformative aspects of learning and relationships. They are aspects of everyday spirituality identified as spiritual withness; spiritual inbetweenness; and the spiritually elsewhere. Representing spiritual experience is challenging. The thesis is written in narrative form and contains core narratives as prose and poems. Using writing as a means of discovery made communicating spirituality through the medium of words a possibility. Spirituality is proposed to be an inclusive concept that affirms a sense of connection and this thesis found that all pedagogical practices in early childhood settings have the potential to include a spiritual aspect. In Aotearoa New Zealand many children lead their everyday lives in the context of an early childhood environment that includes teachers and parents as part of that community. This thesis argues that when everyday spirituality permeates early childhood contexts that all aspects of the curriculum are realised and the spiritual experience of everyone connected to that setting is supported.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="subject">spiritual landscape</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">early childhood education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330110 Early childhood education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systems analysis of quadbike loss of control events on New Zealand farms : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management Systems and Ergonomics at Massey University, Palmerston North</field><field name="creator">Moore, David John</field><field name="description">There are an estimated 70,000 quadbikes (also called All-Terrain Vehicles, four-wheelers or ATV) in use within the farming community in New Zealand, and these have been linked to approximately seven deaths per year since 1997. ACC paid compensation in excess of $3.6 million on new and on-going quadbike-related claims in 2003-4, and the Department of Labour (OSH) have identified quadbike use as their single greatest area of concern in farm safety. The main aims of this series of studies were to: establish the scale and cost of LCE involving quadbikes as well as their context of use on New Zealand farms, develop an investigative methodology suitable for off-road application, identify risk factors for LCE and their interactions, and generate potential interventions. The research comprised a literature review and three studies. The first was an epidemiological analysis of ACC claims data for serious quadbike-related injuries in the year to July 2001, identified individually through the free narrative text in the ACC database. The second study explored the context of farm quadbike use through data gathering with multiple industry sources including users at the 55 farms visited for the third study. This final phase consisted of investigations at the scenes of 156 LCE. Data on the event sequences and contributory factors were captured and analysed using a modified event sequence chart developed from established methods in the ergonomics, forensics psychology and aviation literature. Environmental context-dependent cues and scale models of quadbikes and implements were used to assist the subjects recall event details. An interactive quadbike LCE model incorporating information processing features was developed as a further analysis tool. Potential interventions were identified acting at various system levels. These included changes in: farm management, work organisation, regulation, vehicle conceptualisation, detailed quadbike design and modification, rider awareness and training.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quadbikes</field><field name="subject">loss of control events</field><field name="subject">accidents</field><field name="subject">farm safety</field><field name="subject">systems analysis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::359900 Other Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From the Rainbow Nation to the Land of the Long White Cloud : migration, gender and biography : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Sociology, Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Meares, Carina</field><field name="description">This thesis contributes to and extends two well-established traditions in sociology: firstly, it uses a biographical approach to study the experience of international migration; and secondly, it generates theory from the lived texture of individual lives. Specifically, the research uses the Biographic Narrative Interpretive Method (BNIM) to describe, analyse and theorise the gendered experience of migration from &#8216;the rainbow nation&#8217; of South Africa, to New Zealand, &#8216;the land of the long white cloud&#8217;. The thesis follows and further develops BNIM&#8217;s sociobiographic approach, integrating a stronger sociological focus, and emphasising the feminist values of transparency, reflexivity and an attention to power differences between the researcher and her interviewees. In-depth interviews based on a single narrative-seeking question are conducted with South African migrants from several divergent groups, and are then used as the foundation for a process of intensive researcher-led group analysis. From this meticulous analytical process the researcher produces three detailed individual case studies. It is argued that in order to comprehend the significance of broad social phenomena such as migration and gender, it is imperative to have an appreciation of their meaning in the context of individual lives. Noting the occurrence of migration-related disruption across each of the case studies, the thesis uses the concept of biographical disruption to generate an innovative analytic vocabulary and a model that together describe and represent the gendered biographical experience of international migration. The research also uses the analytic language and the model to illustrate the impact of migration on the gender dynamics of migrants&#8217; intimate relationships. It does this by considering one of the pivotal tensions through which gender dynamics are reconstructed in the context of migration, the tension between migrants&#8217; productive and reproductive responsibilities. The language and the model theorise the resolution of this tension in a number of ways, thus extending the terms of the debate about the impact of migration on gender dynamics beyond the current binary conceptualisation of emancipation or subjugation. The utility of the language and the model in their depiction of the overall biographical experience of migration, and the illustration of the effect of migration on gender dynamics is demonstrated in the thesis through their application to each of the individual case studies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international migration</field><field name="subject">South Africa</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">sociobiography</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370500 Demography::370502 Migration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refugees as 'others' : social and cultural citizenship rights for refugees in New Zealand health services : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mortensen, Annette Claire</field><field name="description">Citizenship, as effective social, cultural and economic participation for refugee groups, depends on appropriate institutional structures and processes in resettlement societies. This thesis using critical social theoretical perspectives addresses the paradox of being legally a citizen, but substantively excluded from the very rights that constitute such citizenship. The thesis draws on theoretical models of newcomer integration in order to promote the development of a more inclusive society for refugees in New Zealand. The issues to be considered include responses from central government and from public institutions&#8212;particularly health, education, employment and welfare&#8212;in addressing social exclusion and promoting integration. The questions of refugee integration to be addressed conceptually must take into consideration cultural and religious diversity, on the one hand, and socio-economic inequality on the other. In New Zealand, the 1987 review of refugee resettlement policy, which established an annual quota of 750 places, has given priority to those with the highest health and social needs and removed preferences for specific national, ethnic and religious groups. Significantly, in the 1990s radical neo-liberal economic reforms were introduced and publicly provided health, education and welfare systems were restructured. This posed serious challenges to the core idea of social citizenship in general in New Zealand society. Noticeable ethnic diversification has been just one element of the resettlement policy changes; the other has been long-term social and economic exclusion in the refugee groups settled since this time. This study indicates that New Zealand&#8217;s notably humanitarian refugee resettlement policy is not matched by adequate central government and public institutional responses and resources with which to integrate refugee groups. This qualitative study examines the role of one institution in particular, health care. The study takes a multi-method approach, using historical and social policy analysis to set the structural context for the interpretation of data from participant interviews. During fieldwork, twenty-eight semi-structured interviews were conducted with health care providers in community, primary and secondary care sectors in the Auckland region, in both governmental and non-governmental agencies. This research demonstrates at a service level, the consequences of overlooking refugee peoples in New Zealand social policy, data collection systems, research and health strategies. Importantly though, the research discovers a number of &#8216;activation points&#8217;&#8212;or approaches that have been developed by health care practitioners&#8212;that highlight future opportunities for the inclusion of refugee groups. One finding is that the New Zealand health system must address the question of how to effect a shift from universalist conceptions of generalised eligibility for health services to targeted interventions for refugees. The conclusions drawn from the study are: firstly, that an overarching integration policy for refugees, led by central government, is required. Secondly, institutional responses that accommodate the special psychosocial, socio-economic and cultural/religious requirements of refugee groups are needed. This would include the development of a locally relevant multiculturalism to guide social policy in New Zealand. In the long-term, for peoples from refugee backgrounds to become full political, social, economic and cultural members of New Zealand society, there needs to be a rethinking of the contemporary models of citizenship offered.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">refugees</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">social citizenship</field><field name="subject">integration</field><field name="subject">cultural citizenship</field><field name="subject">heath system</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Searchbots.net : the influence of a narrative interface on the motivational levels of user contribution to an open content search engine : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Design, Institute of Communication Design, College of Creative Arts, Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zeman, Mark</field><field name="description">This study sets out to explore and test the application of narrative and personification to the interface design and user experience of a search engine.

It examines the formation of parishes, the appointment of clergy, the construction of church buildings and the provision of finance &#8211; in other words, all that was required for the provision of ministry in local communities. It is less concerned with the administration of dioceses, the accomplishments of bishops, the activities of General Synod, and constitutional issues, except where these had a bearing on the core issue. Similarly, it does not concern itself with the development of social services, the establishment of schools, and the building of cathedrals. In the same way, it does not give attention to the issue of provision of ministry to and by Maori. That history is too important to be absorbed into this topic. It demands serious treatment from someone with the necessary skills and background. The present writer lacks that competence. Settler Anglicanism ministered to 40 per cent of the population and did so in every town and suburb, and virtually every rural area in the land. No other social institution had such wide coverage. It is not a story of triumph but of dedication and difficulty, of frustration and exasperation, and of challenges and lost opportunities. There was never enough money to meet every need, there were never enough clergy to provide adequate staffing, and often never enough adequate buildings. External forces (including two world wars, a major economic depression and natural disasters) upset carefully laid plans. It was a Church that was &#8216;in the midst&#8217;. It rarely sought to escape from the world; more often its endeavour was to be there with its people, sharing their sorrows and joys, providing the ministrations for the big events of their lives, and nurturing them in regular worship, Sunday schools and women&#8217;s groups, and building a sense of community. This was the church of an important section of the community, a community that was at the same time at the heart of New Zealand society and yet aware of its English origins and residual loyalties. On the whole, church members acquiesced in this dilemma for no strong revolutionary spirit was alive in them. The call for a distinctive New Zealand version of Anglicanism was a muted one. They were no less loyal to New Zealand; it was simply that it was a New Zealand that was proud to be part of the British Empire, and a Church that was proud to be part of a Church of England. If any common thread emerges, it is the continuing plea to the members of this Church to raise up from among themselves men who would minister to their own people in their own land &#8211; &#8216;sound, adaptable, missionary-hearted men, who are not afraid to tackle hard problems and difficulties of many kinds&#8217;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anglican Church</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430101 History: New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">T&#257;niko : public participation, young M&#257;ori women, &amp; wh&#257;nau health : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in M&#257;ori Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gray, Katarina Ani Putepute</field><field name="description">Recent M&#257;ori, sexual, and primary health developments have been influenced by the principle of participation. For example, the use of a wh&#257;nau-centred approach, of community development, and of Primary Health Organisations allows participation in decision-making. However, none of the abovenamed strategies adequately explain how young M&#257;ori women can participate in decision-making in one common area: M&#257;ori, sexual, primary health policy. This thesis explores how Primary Health Organisations can work with young M&#257;ori women to promote sexual health to wh&#257;nau by focusing on policymaking processes and effective participation mechanisms. M&#257;ori health development from colonial Contact to 2005 is reviewed before the broad health framework (the New Zealand Health Strategy and the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000) is defined. A critique of relevant policy, in particular He Korowai Oranga (2002), the Sexual and Reproductive Health Strategy (2001), and The Primary Health Care Strategy (2001), reveals scope for participation and wh&#257;nau-centredness. Primary Health Organisations pose challenges to wh&#257;nau sexual health promotion. However, with public participation from young M&#257;ori women, like the thesis participants, new opportunities can be realised.

A qualitative strategy employing semi-structured interviews with three young M&#257;ori women was followed by a confirmatory stage of content analysis utilising a deductive public participation evaluation tool: the T&#257;niko instrument. The instrument analysed four policymaking decisions and two mechanisms: organised peer groups and the w&#257;hine-centred approach. The research concluded that when defining how, by whom, and to whom information is presented, organised peer groups can be utilised at the coordination and evaluation policymaking stages. The w&#257;hine-centred approach can share or manage participation through problem definition, consultation, decision, and implementation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">M&#257;ori</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">health framework</field><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="subject">wh&#257;nau</field><field name="subject">decision-making</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/640</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Grappling with complexity : finding the core problems behind aircraft accidents : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Aviation at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zotov, Dmitri Victorovitch</field><field name="description">The purpose of accident investigation is the discovery of causal factors, so that they may be remedied, in order to avert the recurrence of accidents (ICAO, 1994). However, experience has shown that the present intuitive methods of analysis do not always achieve this aim. Investigation failure may come about because of failure to discover causal factors, or to devise effective remedies, or to persuade those in a position to act of the need to do so. Each of these types of failure can be made less likely by the use of formal analytical methods which can show whether information gathering has been incomplete, and point to the sources of additional information that may be needed. A formal analysis can be examined by formal logical tests. Also, the use of formal change mechanisms can not only devise changes likely to be effective, but can present these changes in such a way that the case for them is compelling. Formal methods currently available are concerned with what happened, and why it happened. To produce generic remedies which might avert future accidents of similar type, some formal change mechanism is needed. The Theory of Constraints has become widely adopted in business as a way of replacing undesirable effects with desired outcomes. The Theory of Constraints has not previously been used for safety investigation, and a principal object of this thesis is to see whether it can usefully be employed in this area. It is demonstrated that the use of formal methodology can bring to light factors which were overlooked during an official accident investigation, and can &#8216;tell the story&#8217; in a more coherent manner than is possible with present methods. The recommendations derived from the formal analysis are shown to be generic in nature, rather than particular to the airline involved and the accident studied, and so could have a wider effect in improving safety.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">accident investigation</field><field name="subject">Theory of Constraints</field><field name="subject">aircraft accidents</field><field name="subject">complexity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350400 Transportation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-thinking drowning risk : the role of water safety knowledge, attitudes and behaviours in the aquatic recreation of New Zealand youth : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Moran, Kevin</field><field name="description">This study evolved from concerns about the number of young people drowning in New Zealand (544 deaths between 1980-1994), the author&#8217;s long experience with surf life saving and the suspicion that participation statistics on aquatic recreation do not adequately explain why so many young people drown. It was postulated that the risk of drowning associated with aquatic recreation also was the consequence of many underlying water safety influences that operate at intrapersonal, interpersonal and community levels. Thus the purpose of the study was to obtain comprehensive data on what young people know, think and do about their safety during aquatic recreation. A 25-item questionnaire was designed to survey a randomised sample of New Zealand youth (2202, year 11, 15 &#8211; 19 year olds) to assess their participation in, knowledge about and behaviour during aquatic recreation. To develop the questionnaire, a conceptual framework was devised that constructed the risk of drowning as a complex phenomenon dependent on how often young people participate in various forms of water-based activities, but largely influenced by their water safety knowledge, attitudes and behaviour, all of which are shaped by social, cultural and demographic variables. Almost all New Zealand youth had taken part in some swimming (98%) or other aquatic activity (94%) in the previous year. Risk of drowning was exacerbated among many students because they had poor water safety skills and knowledge, held unsound water safety attitudes, and often practiced at-risk behaviours. For example, many students estimated that they could not swim more than 100 m (54%), thought that swimming was acceptable at a surf beach after patrol hours (61%), and had swum outside patrol flags (61%) or never worn lifejacket (19%) during aquatic recreation. Taken separately, any one of these dispositions is capable of heightening drowning risk; taken collectively they offer strong explanation as to why youth are at greater risk of drowning than others. When analysed by gender, the lack of water safety knowledge, the prevalence of unsafe attitudes and at-risk behaviours among males was consistent and pronounced. The effect of socio-economic status and ethnicity on these risk-enhancing dispositions was less pronounced, although the data did suggest that the knowledge base of youth from low-decile schools and of Pasifika and Asian ethnicity provided least protective potential in the event of unintentional submersion.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aquatic recreation</field><field name="subject">water safety</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">drowning</field><field name="subject">safety education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Degradation of PCP by laccases of the white-rot fungus Trametes sp. HR577 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Chemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Guthrie, Jenness Margaret</field><field name="description">Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is a biocide used by the NZ forestry industry until 1988. Its use was discontinued due to its toxicity to humans and animals. White-rot fungi have been shown to degrade PCP in laboratory and field trials. New Zealand native white-rot fungi were screened to identify organisms suitable for the clean up of PCP contaminated sites. Four criteria were used for the screening: fungal growth at different temperatures, PCP and creosote resistance and PCP degradation in standard liquid medium. Twenty isolates were identified as potentially useful from over 200 that were screened. One unique isolate, Trametes sp. HR577, was chosen for intensive study because it produced the well known laccases previously described from other PCP-degrading white-rot fungi. The white-rot isolate HR577 was assigned to the genus Trametes based on morphological characteristics and gene sequencing studies. The latter showed that the partial laccase gene sequences from Trametes sp. HR 577 had high sequence homology to laccases from other Trametes species, especially T. versicolor and T. villosa. Two laccase isozymes, designated L1c and L2, were purified from Trametes sp. HR577. These isozymes had similar biological properties to other Trametes species laccase isozymes. Both isozymes had a relatively high temperature optima, however, they were not very stable at elevated temperature. The dependence of laccase on dissolved oxygen for catalysis was demonstrated for isozyme L2. Laccase activity was severely inhibited in the absence of dissolved oxygen. This could be restored by reoxygenation into the assay system. Whole cultures of Trametes sp. HR577 grown in liquid culture removed up to 76% of PCP after 72 hours. PCP removal was mostly due to degradation rather than adsorption of PCP to fungal mycelium. Addition of purified and crude laccase isozymes (100 U mL-1) did not enhance PCP degradation. 6-15% of PCP was removed from solutions containing solely purified isozyme L1c or L2 in acetate buffer over 72 hours. Addition of ethanol or the laccase mediator compound 2,2' azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) resulted in increased PCP disappearance from purified laccase cultures. These studies show that the white-rot Trametes sp. HR577 has potential to be used for the clean up of PCP contaminated sites in NZ.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pentachlorophenol</field><field name="subject">white-rot fungi</field><field name="subject">site remediation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strain and structure of a temperate, maritime glacier : Te Moeka o Tuawe / Fox Glacier, South Westland, New Zealand : thesis submitted in fulfilment of the degree of Master of Science in Physical Geography, at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Appleby, John Richard</field><field name="description">The study of glaciers has an immense significance for understanding and predicting global environmental change. The Earth is a dynamic system, consisting of individual units such as the cryosphere, an understanding of which may provide the basis for predicting future environmental change on a global scale. The dynamics of a glacier, a major indicator of the climatic and environmental situation is often presented as supraglacial structures, which reflect glacier formation, deformation and flow. Although structural attributes such as folds, faults, crevasse traces and foliation are commonly described in glaciers, the origin and significance of many of these structures remains unclear. This research project mapped the surface structures of Fox Glacier, using remote sensing in the form of aerial photographs and field observations, to produce a structural glaciological interpretation of the glacier surface, structural field maps of individual structures, and a schematic structural evolution of Fox Glacier. In addition, cumulative strain, and strain rates were calculated for three different areas of the lower Fox Glacier. The relationship between the observed structures and the measured strain rates has also been considered. Fox Glacier is located in the South Westland region of the South Island of New Zealand. From the Main Divide of the Southern Alps up to 3000m altitude, Fox Glacier flows for 13 km, terminating at an altitude of 270 metres in temperate rainforest, 17 km from the present coastline. The steep gradient allows for relatively rapid ice flow. Despite being a very dynamic glacier, very little research has been carried out on Fox Glacier in recent years with most research in the area being concentrated on its neighbour the Franz Josef, and even more so on the glaciers of the Eastern side of the Main Divide (e.g. the Tasman and Mueller glaciers). There is a high level of spatial variability in structural types observed, and the cumulative strain and strain rates measured on the surface of the Fox Glacier, with the variations being linked to valley topography including long-profile gradient and valley width. Strain rates of 208.78 y-1 and -162.06 y-1 were recorded on Fox Glacier. A relationship can be determined between observed glaciological structural features and measured strain rates, suggesting strain rate has an influence on the type, magnitude, location and frequency of these features, however, the study is only a &#8216;snap-shot&#8217; of the strain conditions experienced in the most dynamically active time, during the summer ablation season. Developing predictive models of the structural evolution of glaciers may help further understanding of how glaciers respond to a change in climatic input, especially climatic warming. This is particularly important for larger ice sheet outlet glaciers whose structure and flow appear to reflect and control dynamics of the ice sheet behind</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glaciology</field><field name="subject">Fox Glacier</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">structure</field><field name="subject">strain</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260115 Glaciology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a balanced and ethically responsible approach to understanding differences in sleep timing : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Public Health at Massey University, Sleep/Wake Research Centre, Wellington Campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Paine, Te Hereripine Sarah-Jane</field><field name="description">The circadian clock defines physiologically optimal times for sleeping, which vary along a continuum of circadian phenotypes from morning- to evening-type. Although different &#8216;chronotypes&#8217; can be discriminated reliably by the Morningness/Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), there is little published information on their prevalence. The timing of sleep is also heavily influenced by societal norms. However, the relative contribution of circadian physiology versus psychosocial factors is unknown. This thesis took a multidimensional approach to investigating preferred sleep timing within the general population of New Zealand (30-49 years). A New Zealand version of the MEQ was mailed to a random stratified sample of 5,000 adults living in the Wellington region (55.7% response rate). Using scoring criteria for middle-aged adults, approximately 25% of the population were morning-types and 25% were evening-types. The sleeping patterns of 15 morning- and 16 evening-types were monitored using actiwatches and sleep diaries. Morning-types slept significantly earlier, but there were no differences in sleep duration or quality. Both chronotypes showed evidence of using the weekend to catch-up on sleep, although this was more evident among evening-types. Differences between chronotypes were also investigated using the endogenous melatonin rhythm as a circadian phase marker. The timing of the melatonin rhythm was earlier among morning-types, with the difference being greater for melatonin onset, than offset. However, differences between weekday versus weekend sleep explained more of the variability in sleep timing that did circadian phase. Understanding the genetic differences in the circadian clock is evolving rapidly. While this is of particular scientific interest, little consideration has been given to the ethical implications of this type of work. In the final study, a Kaupapa M&#257;ori framework was used to explore M&#257;ori hopes and concerns for genetic research in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Thematic analysis indicated that M&#257;ori are not anti-science, however there is an urgent need for ethical guidelines that uphold and respect the values of M&#257;ori society. This thesis argues that sleep is a major public health issue for New Zealand. However, a number of challenges must be met to ensure that new scientific knowledge meets the needs and expectations of the community.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">circadian clock</field><field name="subject">sleep timing</field><field name="subject">chronotype</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation genetics of the world's most endangered seabird, the Chatham Island t&#257;iko (Pterodroma magentae) : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Molecular Biosciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lawrence, Hayley Ann</field><field name="description">The research field of genetics provides useful tools to investigate the biology of species that are difficult to observe and study and are especially valuable in guiding the conservation of endangered species. The Chatham Island T&#257;iko (Tch&#257;ik, Pterodroma magentae) is the world&#8217;s most endangered seabird with an estimated population size of just 120-150 birds, including only 8-15 breeding pairs. This thesis used genetic techniques to investigate aspects of T&#257;iko biology and relationships in order to aid T&#257;iko conservation. The mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and duplicated regions of domain I of the mitochondrial control region were DNA sequenced in almost the entire known T&#257;iko population. The level of genetic variation revealed in T&#257;iko was unexpectedly high considering endangered species typically exhibit low genetic diversity. Sequencing of ancient DNA from subfossil T&#257;iko bones allowed an investigation of the past level of genetic variation and the species&#8217; previous geographic distribution. A large proportion of the genetic diversity of the extinct T&#257;iko populations was retained in the remnant population. However, genetic variation in T&#257;iko chicks was low, thus genetic diversity in the population could be lost in just a few generations. There are many nonbreeding T&#257;iko so DNA sexing was used to examine sex ratios in the population. Almost all unpaired birds were male, which signified a potential Allee effect (i.e. that a reduced density of potential mates is decreasing population productivity). Further understanding of the T&#257;iko mating system and behaviour was obtained by parentage, sibship and pairwise relatedness analyses of genotypes at eight microsatellite DNA loci. It is important that T&#257;iko are found so they can be protected from introduced predators. The results of mitochondrial DNA sequencing and microsatellite DNA genotyping indicated that there are likely to be more T&#257;iko breeding in undiscovered areas. Analysis of philopatry using both mitochondrial and nuclear markers can assist conservation by the identification of areas to search for these undiscovered individuals. T&#257;iko may have once and could still be found on islands near South America since DNA sequencing showed the Magenta Petrel type specimen (collected in 1867 in the South Pacific Ocean) is a T&#257;iko.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chatham Island t&#257;iko</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">genetic variation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270203 Population and ecological genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/657</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecological requirements of the New Zealand falcon (Falco novaseelandiae) in plantation forestry : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Seaton, Richard</field><field name="description">Commercial pine plantations made up of exotic tree species are increasingly recognised as habitats that can contribute significantly to the conservation of indigenous biodiversity in New Zealand. Encouraging this biodiversity by employing sympathetic forestry management techniques not only offers benefits for indigenous flora and fauna but can also be economically advantageous for the forestry industry. The New Zealand falcon (Falco novaeseelandiae) or Karearea, is a threatened species, endemic to the islands of New Zealand, that has recently been discovered breeding in pine plantations. This research determines the ecological requirements of New Zealand falcons in this habitat, enabling recommendations for sympathetic forestry management to be made. Plantation forests that create a mosaic of pine stand ages across a plantation, offer suitable habitat for breeding New Zealand falcons by providing abundant nest sites, promoting high abundances of avian prey and creating favourable conditions for hunting. The diet of falcons within pine forests consisted primarily of birds, of which the majority were exotic passerines. Prey abundances were highest along pine stand edges. Both sexes preferentially hunted along pine stand edges between stands less than four years old and stands more than 20 years old. Pairs also preferentially nested along these borders, particularly within and along the edges of pine stands less than two years old. Within pine stands, nest sites were always located on the ground. Introduced predators and some forestry operations negatively affected breeding success. Nevertheless, productivity was higher than recorded for other habitats and female falcons were recorded successfully breeding in their first year for the first time. High prey densities and availabilities are suggested as the primary explanation for this. The extent of juvenile dispersal strongly suggests that pine plantations supplement populations in surrounding areas where falcons are in decline. This research demonstrates that changes to the existing forestry operational practices can influence the success of the breeding population. This research establishes that if commercial pine plantations are suitably managed, they can support extremely high falcon densities. Plantation forests therefore have a significant role to play in the future conservation of this species.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand falcon</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">pine plantations</field><field name="subject">biodiversity</field><field name="subject">forest management</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270703 Terrestrial ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical and computational analysis of the two-stage capacitated plant location problem : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Decision Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wildbore, Bronwyn Louise</field><field name="description">Mathematical models for plant location problems form an important class of integer and mixed-integer linear programs. The Two-Stage Capacitated Plant Location Problem (TSCPLP), the subject of this thesis, consists of a three level structure: in the first or upper-most level are the production plants, the second or central level contains the distribution depots, and the third level is the customers. The decisions to be made are: the subset of plants and depots to open; the assignment of customers to open depots, and therefore open plants; and the flow of product from the plants to the depots, to satisfy the customers' service or demand requirements at minimum cost. The formulation proposed for the TSCPLP is unique from previous models in the literature because customers can be served from multiple open depots (and plants) and the capacity of both the set of plants and the set of depots is restricted. Surrogate constraints are added to strengthen the bounds from relaxations of the problem. The need for more understanding of the strength of the bounds generated by this procedure for the TSCPLP is evident in the literature. Lagrangian relaxations are chosen based more on ease of solution than the knowledge that a strong bound will result. Lagrangian relaxation has been applied in heuristics and also inserted into branch-and-bound algorithms, providing stronger bounds than traditional linear programming relaxations. The current investigation provides a theoretical and computational analysis of Lagrangian relaxation bounds for the TSCPLP directly. Results are computed through a Lagrangian heuristic and CPLEX. The test problems for the computational analysis cover a range of problem size and strength of capacity constraints. This is achieved by scaling the ratio of total depot capacity to customer demand and the ratio of total plant capacity to total depot capacity on subsets of problem instances. The analysis shows that there are several constraints in the formulation that if dualized in a Lagrangian relaxation provide strong bounds on the optimal solution to the TSCPLP. This research has applications in solution techniques for the TSCPLP and can be extended to some transformations of the TSCPLP. These include the single-source TSCPLP, and the multi-commodity TSCPLP which accommodates for multiple products or services.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">decision-making</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Lagrangian relaxation bounds</field><field name="subject">linear programming</field><field name="subject">theoretical analysis</field><field name="subject">computational analysis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics::230118 Optimisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/660</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community participation in the establishment of a primary health organisation in the Horowhenua : a longitudinal case study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management at Massey University, Turitea, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lockett-Kay, Janet Elizabeth</field><field name="description">In February 2001 the Minister of Health, in announcing the Primary Health Care Strategy (King, 2001), identified Primary Health Organisations as the vehicles for planning, funding and coordinating primary health care services throughout New Zealand. The requirement that communities be involved in their planning and development was integral to this strategy implementation. Investigation of the Horowhenua Primary Health Organisation establishment process from the inception of planning to the formation of a Primary Health Organisation provided an excellent opportunity to analyse the determinants of genuine community participation. This case study extended over a nine-month period. Data collected from multiple sources provided the basis for investigating the complex notion of community participation and the attributes which are essential for sustainable community engagement. The Horowhenua Primary Health Organisation Steering Committee comprised community representatives, iwi and local health professionals. This group along with the two external stakeholder groups - namely the District Health Board Funding Division and the District Health Board Primary Health Care Reference Group &#8211; were central to the analysis. The events recorded and observations made throughout the planning period formed the basis of identifying essential determinants of community participation. These included knowledge of the community and its unique &#8220;ways of doing&#8221;, the dynamic interdependencies both within the Horowhenua community and with stakeholders external to the Horowhenua, changing power relationships, managing material resourcing and accessibility to essential information. These all influenced how this rural community engaged in Primary Health Organisation planning. One common theme which emerges in the literature is the synergy between community participation and community development. A community development approach is a commonly agreed way of engaging communities in health service planning which is genuine, inclusive, self-reliant, and self-determining. This research demonstrated that the New Zealand context, where implementation of the primary health care strategy must be nationally consistent and comply with prescriptive, central government-determined criteria - as well as involving communities in a meaningful way - requires an alternative approach. The thesis presents a way of addressing power discrepancies, promoting interdependencies between stakeholders and achieving inclusiveness in all decision-making where &#8220;expert&#8221; stakeholders and community bring to the partnership a set of attributes and knowledge which collectively informs the entire planning process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community participation</field><field name="subject">planning</field><field name="subject">decision-making</field><field name="subject">community development</field><field name="subject">citizen participation</field><field name="subject">community health services</field><field name="subject">primary health care</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/661</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exiting the matrix : colonisation, decolonisation and social work in Aotearoa : voices of Ng&#257;ti Raukawa ki te Tonga kaimahi wh&#257;nau : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master in Philosophy in Social Work at Massey University, Palmerston North, Aotearoa</field><field name="creator">Bell, Hayley Susan</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the potential use of a facilitated process of decolonisation, or whakaw&#257;tea, amongst wh&#257;nau whakapapa in Aotearoa.

Four classes were involved in the study, two classes were taught a programme based on the RM and two classes were taught using a traditional pedagogical approach to physical education. All four classes were taught by the same teacher. A mixed methodological approach was used combining case study and quasi-experimental research. Data were collected through interviews, observations, analysis of detention patterns, and regular student self-assessments. The implementation was successful in developing positive, supportive and well-behaved classes in physical education. The majority of students developed a greater understanding of personal and social responsibility and became more personally and socially responsible in class. The students were not found to be disadvantaged in meeting the physical education curriculum goals and students in the RM classes were found to be more engaged in their class work than the equivalent students in the control classes. If the true measure of success, however, is that students are able to take what is learnt in physical education and apply it in other contexts, then this implementation was less successful. For the vast majority of students the teaching and learning about personal and social responsibility was firmly associated with physical education and they generally showed little understanding of the potential for the transfer of learning to other contexts. It is possible that a longer implementation and a more consistent reinforcement of the concept of transfer would lead to students developing greater understanding of the models potential application in other areas of their lives. This study has implications for teachers who are considering introducing the RM into their teaching. It provides insights into the realities of implementing the RM into the specific context of secondary school physical education programmes. It also challenges the assumptions that teachers may have that the introduction of the RM is a relatively unproblematic process and identifies a number of areas of potential difficulty. The study concludes with recommendations for teachers contemplating introducing the RM into their practice.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">responsibility model</field><field name="subject">secondary education</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">physical education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/663</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the regulation of conidiation in species of Trichoderma</field><field name="creator">Steyaert, Johanna M.</field><field name="description">A characteristic feature of species of Trichoderma is the production of concentric rings of conidia in response to alternating light-dark conditions. In response to a single burst of light, a single ring of conidia forms at what was the colony perimeter. On the basis of these observations, competency to photoconidiate has been proposed to be due to the age and metabolic rate of the hyphal cell. In this study, conidiation was investigated in five biocontrol isolates (T. hamatum, T. atroviride, T. asperellum, T. virens and T. harzianum) using both a morphological and molecular approach. All five isolates produced concentric conidial rings under alternating light-dark conditions on potato-dextrose agar (PDA), however, in response to a 15 min burst of blue light, only T. asperellum and T. virens produced a clearly, defined conidial ring which correlated with the colony margin at the time of light exposure. Both T. harzianum and T. hamatum photoconidiated in a disk-like fashion and T. atroviride produced a broken ring with a partially filled in appearance. On the basis of these results, it was postulated that competency to photoconidiate is a factor of the metabolic state of the hyphal cell rather than chronological age or metabolic rate. The influence of the source of nitrogen on photoconidiation was assessed on pH-buffered (pH 5.4) minimal medium (MM) amended with glutamine, urea or KNO&#8323;. In the presence of glutamine or urea, T. asperellum and T. harzianum conidiated in a disk, whereas, when KNO&#8323; was the sole nitrogen source, a ring of conidia was produced. Further, in the presence of increasing amounts of glutamine, the clearly defined photoconidial ring produced on PDA by T. asperellum became disk-like. These results clearly demonstrated that primary nitrogen promotes photoconidiation in these isolates and strongly suggests that competency of a hyphal cell to conidiate in response to light is dependent on the nitrogen catabolite repression state of the cell. The experiments were repeated for all five isolates on unbuffered MM. Differences were apparent between the buffered and unbuffered experiments for T. atroviride. No photoconidiation was observed in T. atroviride on buffered medium whereas on unbuffered medium, rings of conidia were produced on both primary and secondary nitrogen. These results show that photoconidiation in T. atroviride is influenced by the buffering capacity of the medium. Conidiation in response to light by T. hamatum and T. virens was absent in all nitrogen experiments, regardless of the nitrogen source and buffering capacity, whereas both isolates conidiated in response to light on PDA. These results imply that either both sources of nitrogen are required for photoconidiation, or a factor essential for conidiation in these two isolates was absent in the minimal medium. Mycelial injury was also investigated in five biocontrol isolates of Trichoderma. On PDA, all isolates except T. hamatum conidiated in response to injury. On nitrogen amended MM, conidiation in response to injury was again observed in all isolates except for T. hamatum. In T. atroviride, injury-induced conidiation was observed on all medium combinations except the pH-buffered MM amended with glutamine or urea and T. virens conidiated in response to injury on primary nitrogen only, regardless of the buffering capacity. These results have revealed conidiation in response to injury to be differentially regulated between isolates/species of Trichoderma. On unbuffered MM amended with glutamine or urea, conidiation in response to injury occurred at the colony perimeter only in T. atroviride. It was hypothesised that the restriction of conidiation to the perimeter may be due to changes in the pH of the agar. The experiment was repeated and the pH values of the agar under the growing colony measured at the time of light induction (48 h) or injury (72 h). The areas under the hyphal fronts were acidified to below the starting value of the medium (pH 5.4) and the centres of the plates were alkalinised. The region of acidification at the time of stimuli correlated with the production of conidia, which implicates a role for crossregulation of conidiation by the ambient pH. The influence of the ambient pH on injury-induced conidiation was investigated in T. hamatum and T. atroviride on MM amended with glutamine and PDA, pH-buffered from pH 2.8 to 5.6. Thickening of the hyphae around the injury site was observed at the lowest pH values on MM in both T. atroviride and T. hamatum, however no conidia were produced, whereas both Trichoderma species conidiated on pH-buffered PDA in a strictly low pH-dependent fashion. This is the first observation of injury-induced conidiation in T. hamatum. The influence of the ambient pH on photoconidiation was assessed in T. hamatum, T. atroviride and T. harzianum using both buffered and unbuffered PDA from pH 2.8 to 5.2. On buffered PDA, no conidiation in response to light was observed above pH 3.2 in T. hamatum, above 4.0 in T. atroviride and above 4.4 in T. harzianum, whereas on unbuffered PDA it occurred at all pH values tested. It was postulated that conidiation at pH values above 4.4 on unbuffered PDA was due to acidification of the agar. The pH values of the agar under the growing colony were measured at the time of light exposure and in contrast to the MM with glutamine experiments, alkalisation of the agar had occurred in both T. atroviride and T. hamatum. No change in medium pH was recorded under the growing T. harzianum colony. These results indicate that low pH-dependence of photoconidiation is directly related to the buffering capacity of the medium. Recent studies have linked regulation of conidiation in T. harzianum to Pac1, the PacC orthologue. In fungi, PacC regulates gene expression in response to the ambient pH. In these studies pH-dependent photoconidiation occurred only on buffered PDA and on unbuffered PDA conidiation occurred at significantly higher ambient pH levels. It is proposed that the influence of ambient pH on conidiation in the isolates used in this study is not due to direct Pac1 regulation. The T. harzianum isolate used in this study produced profuse amounts of the yellow anthraquinone pachybasin. Production of this secondary metabolite was strictly pH-dependent, irrespective of the buffering capacity of the medium. Studies in T. harzianum have linked Pac1 regulation to production of an antifungal &#945;-pyrone. pH-dependence on both buffered and unbuffered media strongly suggests that pachybasin production may also be under the control of Pac1. Photoconidiation studies on broth-soaked filter paper, revealed rhythmic conidiation in the pachybasin producing T. harzianum isolate. Diffuse rings of conidia were produced in dark-grown cultures and, in cultures exposed to light for 15 min at 48 h, the rings were clearly defined. These results show that conidiation is under the control of an endogenous rhythm in T. harzianum and represent the first report of circadian conidiation in a wild-type Trichoderma. A Free-Running Rhythm (FRR) assay was used to investigate rhythmic gene expression in T. atroviride IMI206040 and a mutant derivative, in which the wc-2 orthologue, blr-2, was disrupted. Over a 3 d period, expression of gpd, which encodes the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, oscillated with a period of about 48 h. In the &#916;blr-2 mutant, the gpd rhythm was absent. These results revealed that in T. atroviride, gpd expression is under the control of an endogenous clock and that clock-regulated expression of gpd is associated with a functional BLR complex. Using degenerate primers, a portion of frq, which encodes the N. crassa clock oscillator FREQUENCY, was isolated from T. atroviride and used to probe the FRR assay northern blots. No frq expression was detected at any time point, which suggests that the circadian clock in Trichoderma does not involve FREQUENCY. In a concurrent study, orthologues of rco-1 (rcoT) were isolated and sequenced from T. atroviride and T. hamatum using a combination of degenerate, inverse and specific PCR. RcoT is an orthologue of the yeast global co-repressor Tup1 and in the filamentous fungi, RcoT orthologues have been demonstrated to negatively regulate conidiation. Genomic analysis of all available rcoT orthologues revealed the conservation of erg3, a major ergosterol biosynthesis gene, upstream from rcoT in ascomycetous filamentous fungi, but not in the ascomycetous yeast or in the basidiomycetes. These studies have significantly contributed to our understanding of the regulatory factors controlling conidiation in Trichoderma and have multiple implications for Trichoderma biocontrol; most notable the promotion of conidiation by primary nitrogen and low pH. Incubation conditions can be altered to suit the nitrogen and pH preferences of a biocontrol strain in order to promote cost effective conidial production, however this is not easily achieved in the soil, where the biocontrol strain must perform in a highly buffered environment optimised for plant growth. Successful use of Trichoderma biocontrol strains may involve the screening and targeting of strains to the appropriate pH conditions or the selection of new strains on the basis of capacity to perform under a given range of conditions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trichoderma</field><field name="subject">conidiation</field><field name="subject">nitrogen catabolite repression</field><field name="subject">pH regulation</field><field name="subject">anthraquinone</field><field name="subject">pachybasin</field><field name="subject">circadian</field><field name="subject">free-running rhythm</field><field name="subject">blr-1</field><field name="subject">frq</field><field name="subject">gpd</field><field name="subject">rcoT</field><field name="subject">erg3</field><field name="subject">con-10</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology::270305 Mycology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of past and future vegetation change for the lizard fauna of Motunau Island</field><field name="creator">Bannock, C. A.</field><field name="description">Abundance, distribution and habitat preferences of the lizard species present on Motunau Island, off the Canterbury coast of New Zealand, were investigated. The aim of the study was to investigate the extent to which recent vegetation change on Motunau Island has effected the lizard community and what implications this has for the future management of the Island. Three species of lizard occur on Motunau Island; the common gecko (Hoplodactylus maculatus), common skink (Oligosoma nigriplantare polychroma) and spotted skink (O. lineoocellatum). Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were present on the island from 1862 until their eradication in 1962. Since then, vegetation on the island has changed from being tussock-dominated to being dominated by exotic weeds. Data from lizard pitfall trap surveys carried out in 1967-75 by Tony Whitaker of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) were compared with new pitfall trapping data to determine if changes in the lizard population had occurred in response to these vegetation changes. The abundance of O. n. polychroma and H. maculatus does not appear to change significantly. The distribution of these two species were significantly correlated but neither showed any preference for a particular type. The abundance of O. lineoocellatum was significantly greater in 1996/97 than in the earlier DSlR surveys. This could be a result of the vegetation becoming more open and more structurally complex since the early surveys. This would offer greater opportunities for O. lineoocellatum (which is strongly heliothermic) to thermoregulate and forage. O. lineoocellatum showed no consistent significant preference towards any habitat type, although they tended to be found more in 'margin' habitat. Research into pitfall trapping and the way lizard behaviour may influence pitfall trapping data needs to be undertaken as there is a possible trap bias in this study. Management of Motunau Island needs to ensure that a structurally complex environment is maintained to ensure high numbers of all three lizard species can continue to coexist.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">common gecko</field><field name="subject">Hoplodactylus maculatus</field><field name="subject">common skink</field><field name="subject">Oligosoma nigriplantare polychroma</field><field name="subject">spotted skink</field><field name="subject">Oligosoma lineoocellafum</field><field name="subject">Motunau Island</field><field name="subject">vegetation change</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270703 Terrestrial ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"They're not including us!" : neighbourhood deprivation and older adults' leisure time physical activity participation</field><field name="creator">Annear, M. J.</field><field name="description">Population ageing and the tendency for older adults to have poorer health status than younger adults have raised concerns about potential increases in the number of elderly suffering disease and disability. Significantly, many health problems experienced in later life are associated with the onset of a more sedentary lifestyle. Increasing older adults' participation in leisure time physical activity (henceforth LTPA) offers an opportunity to reduce the prevalence of preventable morbidity in later life and offset a potential burden of ageing on the public health sector. As a forerunner to the development of strategies to increase older adults' LTPA participation, researchers have investigated the intrapersonal, interpersonal and, to a lesser extent, environmental influences on this health behaviour. Recent findings from studies of the adult population have suggested that neighbourhood deprivation, a measure of the socioeconomic conditions of small areas, may significantly influence LTPA participation. Extending previous findings, this research investigated how neighbourhood deprivation influenced older adults' LTPA participation. A total of 63 older adults were recruited from high- and low-deprivation neighbourhoods in Christchurch, New Zealand. Neighbourhoods were selected because of their relative positions on the New Zealand Deprivation Index and were characterised by the researcher as "East-town", a neighbourhood of high deprivation, and "West-town", a neighbourhood of low deprivation. The research incorporated a cross-sectional, comparative and mixed-methods approach. The methods of enquiry employed in this research included a recall survey, Q method, and semi-structured interviewing. Each method addressed a different aspect of the primary research question and provided data that was used in the creation of an integrated model depicting the influence of neighbourhood deprivation on older adults' LTPA participation.  The results derived from the three research methods showed that older adults from the low-deprivation neighbourhood of West-town participated in LTPA more frequently than older adults from the high-deprivation neighbourhood of East-town. East-town was identified as having many physical and social environmental constraints to LTPA and comparatively few facilitators. Alternatively, West-town was found to have many physical and social environmental facilitators to LTPA and relatively few constraints. Neighbourhood attributes which appeared to influence older adults' LTPA participation included appropriateness of leisure provision, neighbourhood attractiveness, walkability, traffic, and perceptions of crime and antisocial behaviour. One implication of this research is that environmental interventions should be considered in attempts to engage older adults in LTPA for health purposes, particularly in high-deprivation neighbourhoods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">population ageing</field><field name="subject">older adult</field><field name="subject">compression of morbidity</field><field name="subject">leisure time physical activity</field><field name="subject">neighbourhood deprivation</field><field name="subject">physical environment</field><field name="subject">social environment</field><field name="subject">mixed methods</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370403 Recreation and leisure studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/468</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Between Practice and...</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This Ph.D. by Publication essay organises my work in four sections: Between Practice and Research; Between Practice and Clinical/Operational Management; Between Practice and Policy; and Between Practice and the Public. A context-setting introduction puts the work in the temporal frame of the 1960's through 2001 and announces the point of view taken on nursing: the reason for the existence of the modern health care delivery system is to provide nursing care. In the first section, the publications deal with the development of clinical nursing research methods.  My particular effort was to conceptualise the relationship between nursing practice and research.  The publications show how that relationship was actualised. The second section contains work done 20 years or so after that reported in the first section, but the work is closely related.  Here, the publications deal with the extension of the notion of nursing practice research to clinical/operational management using the rich administrative data produced by casemix (Diagnosis Related Groups - DRGs). This body of work reveals nursing as resource.  The third section holds literature review and policy analysis that provide the contexts for nursing practice.  Publications deal particularly with the 'expanded role' of nursing as nurse practitioner, nurse-midwife and nurse anesthetist.  Research and policy are knit together in this section. In the fourth section, I connect nursing to public forums. The concluding section draws together the themes that have occurred throughout: valuing nursing and making the discipline visible and credible in terms the world understands.  The thesis ends with a metaphor that makes research, operations and policy one with public practice: nursing as craft.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing research</field><field name="subject">Nursing history</field><field name="subject">Nursing literature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hello, ruel World</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The analytic component of the thesis approaches major questions in Cultural Studies, Philosophy and Social Theory through an investigation of various forms of creative practice.  I approach the question of agency, for instance, through a study of stage actors, who must recite set lines, and yet feel empowered precisely by the opportunity to act through them.  Investigation of the author's own work as a poet and novelist serves to cast light upon ideology, ie. how one might use a constrained language and yet feel empowered to speak new things through it.  I apply these investigations to Althusser, whose famous essay on the total power of ideological interpellation is permeated  with theatrical metaphor.  I suggest that Althusser is repressing the creative component of everyday life, something social theory has ever found hard to theorise.  I proceed to suggest that the place where such processes are analysed is in the philosophy of science. The work of Charles Saunders Peirce on the experimental method is, my investigation uncovers, surprisingly geared toward the investigation of creativity.  In science one has a method for, and an extensive literature on, discovering new phenomena.  My thesis is that the experimental method of modern scientists, and the creative method of modern writers, both geared toward the production of things that are at once new and true, is largely the same.  I use Peircean semiotics to argue that creative composition is about listening to the languages spoken all round you, and transcribing their objective contours.  So as to have effect on others.  Which is just like science.  And in both instances we are endlessly spoken through at every moment by the myriad languages which interpellate us.  Whence creativity (for those who are open to it).  My three portfolio pieces are:  Cube Root of Book: a series of one hundred and thirty two poems set at intervals along the descending spiral of a Fibonacci number sequence.

Unaustralia, a Study of Heads, an attempt to show the relevance of these findings to Cultural Studies and other related practices.  It centres on my new reading of Althusser, and is flanked by mini-ethnographies of creative practice, including the above.  The poetry is presented as a major new creative work.

CSC Index study (in CIO Enterprise, July 1998) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems promise to revolutionise the way a business operates: allowing greater flexibility, market responsiveness, customer service, management information and reduced costs. However experiences and opinions vary dramatically as to whether ERP systems deliver on these promises. Certainly ERP systems customer demand remains strong, with major ERP systems vendors experiencing several years of double-digit growth and better, with a whole sub-industry of consultants and systems integrators growing around ERP system. This study examines the strategic nature and implications of the ERP systems decision: in reality a multitude of decisions, which together have drastic and lasting effects on nearly all aspects of an organisation. As with all strategic issues, there is no `step-by-step recipe for success' with ERP, but rather a successful approach depends on the specific organisation and its environment. Therefore what is required is an assessment and analysis of these, the results of which are combined with established knowledge about IT systems development and implementation to determine the most suitable approach. In this way ERP is integrated with organisational strategy and therefore can achieve maximum benefit. If ERP is not viewed and managed as a strategic project, it is likely, at best, to be a massive waste of resources and, at worst, may cripple an organisation.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business planning</field><field name="subject">Manufacturing resource planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Friend or Intruder? Living with an Implantable Defibrillator: Patients' and Partners' Experiences.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a reliable, cost-effective implanted device designed to terminate life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and prevent sudden death. The recent exponential increase in implantation rates emphasises the need for nurses, doctors and other clinicians to understand the experience of living with an ICD for patients and partners. Current knowledge of patient experiences is mostly derived from overseas studies of specific variables, including physical problems, psychosocial outcomes, ICD shocks and quality of life issues. Studies of partner experiences focus on psychosocial concerns. Using van Manen's (1990) hermeneutic phenomenological approach, this study describes the experience of living with an ICD for seven Australian patients and six partners.  Experiential descriptions, obtained in tape-recorded conversational interviews, were subjected to three levels of analysis. The first descriptive analysis summarised individual experiences of living with an ICD. The second, thematic analysis phenomenologically described the collective lived experience of being a patient, and of being a partner. Each description identified a challenging and changing experience through the themes of Being Disrupted and Distressed, Reconstructing Life, Appreciating and Celebrating Life, and Accommodating the ICD. For the patient, various everyday interactions, events and activities meant either being able to trust the ICD as a reassuring protection or experiencing it as an inescapable intrusive object. For the partner, a trusting reliance on the ICD's protective security eased the vulnerability and onerous perceived responsibility for the patient's survival and well-being. Threats to the partner's restored sense of normality, security and hope occurred when the patient wanted the ICD removed or discontinued. The third hermeneutic analysis specifically explored how the ICD, as an implanted biomedical device, was perceived, embodied and comprehended by patients. This analysis disclosed the varied, ambiguous existential meanings derived from and accorded to the ICD's presence, power and potential. The interpretation concluded that the ICD was either embodied as a trusted and reassuring friend, or existentially rejected as an intruder that thwarted meaningful possibilities. Theoretical and practical implications of this understanding of living with an ICD included several recommendations for improving staff education, as well as practical interventions for informing and supporting patients and partners. A proposal for implementing these recommendations concluded with suggestions for future inquiries that would extend understanding of this increasingly common human phenomenon.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">We Love To Hate Help Desk</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Customer satisfaction with the Information Technology Help Desk is the focus of this study. Technology in the workplace has increased exponentially. Therefore customers are more reliant on the Help Desk then ever before. This has raised the importance of the role that Help Desk plays in the functioning of an organisation.  The fundamental aim of this study is to answer  the questions below;  1. Is dissatisfaction truly present for individual problems, or is it a generalisation or "urban myth"?  2. Which of the five hypotheses are the most significant in causing dissatisfaction amongst customers? The five hypotheses focus on the areas of Communication, Solutions, Service, Knowledge (up-to-date), and Morale.  A computer-based survey was used to query the customers. The survey questions linked back to the hypotheses. The customer was given the opportunity to make an optional comment to discover any sensitive issues that the survey did not address.  The average "overall satisfaction" rating for the survey suggested the general population is more satisfied then dissatisfied with the services of the Help Desk. From the study I was able to conclude that dissatisfaction is present for individual problems, but the dissatisfied customer only accounts for 8% of the surveyed population.  Having proven that customer dissatisfaction is present the next step was to determine the nature of the problem to provide useful information to reduce customer dissatisfaction. Investigating the surveys on the basis of problem category did this.  The results indicated that customer dissatisfaction was most prevalent in calls concerning changes made to PCs and server interruptions. Therefore the Help Desk needs to re-evaluate the processes for handling problems of this nature. In contrast customers were most satisfied with assistance for problems relating to desktop software and hardware. Therefore dissatisfaction is not an "urban myth".  Of all the five hypotheses, Help Desk morale stood out as producing more satisfaction than any of the other hypotheses including "overall satisfaction". Help Desk morale proved to be significantly different in nature when compared to the four other hypotheses. Therefore the moral of the Help Desk team is a fundamental ingredient for brewing a successful service. Get this wrong and all aspects of the team and the service will decline.  The most important influence on "overall satisfaction" was "satisfaction with keeping up with technological change", and the least important factor was "satisfaction with ability to predict problems through good communication". This would indicate an up-to-date Help Desk is more likely to have satisfied customers.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information technology.</field><field name="subject">Computer industry.</field><field name="subject">Customer services.</field><field name="subject">Management.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Holistic aspects of rehabilitation post cardiac surgery in the Bonny method of guided imagery and music.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis has set out to investigate the role of music therapy in the form of the specialist Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music (GIM) with a view to exploring how meanings related to adjustment from a health crisis (such as cardiac surgery) are depicted in music-supported imagery. Factors shaping clinical interpretations of verbal and musical responses in music therapy practice are often unclear or undelineated. A systematic interpretive process relevant to clinical health care was developed using the Bonny Method of Guide Imagery and Music (GIM), providing a means for exploring the emotional difficulties of coronary bypass patients, who typically recover quickly from physical surgery but often experience residual symptoms such as depression, pain, and anxiety. The interpretive process accessed both verbal and non-verbal texts, playing them against each other in order to find significance for music therapy practice in rehabilitation. A Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music (GIM) series was undertaken by patients recovering from coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), with each session audiotaped and transcribed. This narrative data was analyzed thematically, and grand themes were used to focus further intertextual (semiotic) and Jungian perspectives, in the process of deriving substantial clinical meanings. Results suggested that participants used a wide range of personal, cultural and archetypal texts to convey meanings about their health care situation, including images of the music during the therapeutic process. Clinical change in the rehabilitative process was suggested by grand themes comprising 'Looking through the frame', 'Feeling the impact', 'Spiralling into the unexpected', 'Sublime plateau', and 'Rehearsing new steps' and the further music-related grand theme of 'Sounding the changes'. This project highlights the value of GIM as a vehicle to track clinical change with cardiac patients, based on a systematic interpretive process sensitive to the interweaving verbal and nonverbal texts evident in the music therapy context.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music therapy</field><field name="subject">Postoperative care</field><field name="subject">Heart</field><field name="subject">Diseases</field><field name="subject">Patients</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variation and change in university teachers' ways of experiencing teaching</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis explores how university teachers'  ways of experiencing teaching change from teacher focused to student focused and why some teachers experience this change while others do not.  The exploration adopts the theoretical perspective of variation, learning and awareness (Marton and Booth, 1997) and is based on a two-year longitudinal interview study of 27 university teachers.  Classical and new phenomenographies were used to constitute teachers' ways of experiencing teaching and teachers' ways of experiencing change in teaching.  Changes in individual teachers' ways of experiencing were described and interpreted through focusing on teachers' awareness of critical aspects and related dimensions of variation, creating individual vignettes, and constituting themes in the critical experiences and orientations related to change.  The outcomes included six ways of experiencing teaching and their complementary patterns of critical aspects, a set of themes related to change in ways of experiencing and five ways of experiencing change in teaching.  Combining these outcomes resulted in four patterns which illuminated why some teachers' ways of experiencing teaching became student focused while others remained teacher focused.  Teachers who became capable of experiencing teaching in student-focused ways focused on understanding teaching in relation to students' learning.  They experienced change in teaching as becoming more student-focused or as relating teaching to development or change in student understandings, and were oriented towards putting teaching into focus and reflecting in ways informed by formal learning.  These teachers experienced relevance structures which brought the critical aspects of student-focused ways of experiencing teaching to the foreground of their awareness so that they experienced corresponding dimensions of variation.  Their awareness of teaching expanded and this corresponded to a shift in the focus and meaning of teaching.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College teaching.</field><field name="subject">Teachers.</field><field name="subject">Methodology.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Working the knowledge game? The power of the everyday in managing truth in organsations.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis focuses on what I have called truth management.  First it traces how modernist and postmodern theorists play their versions of what counts as true.  A key critique I stage of modernist theorising is that it privileges decontextualised ways of knowing and silences agency.  Drawn from postmodern concerns and my critique of 'normal science', two maps of 'thinking tools' (Bourdieu 1992) are proposed as the basis of my theorising of how truth is managed in organisations.  The first map aims to position contextualism within the empirical gaze.  It is made up of three contingencies - discourses, time and space.  The second map of thinking tools aims to bring agency back into view.  It is made up of four contingencies - identity, capital, practices and power.  Each of the seven contingencies is used to frame the story of an inter-organisational partnership between an Australian university and a financial institution in part two of the thesis.  The story traces their engagement in a negotiated postgraduate degree program - the Work-Based Learning (WBL) program from 1996-2003.  In this way, I aim to demonstrate the power of everyday decision making in determining what counts as true.  The management of truth is seen to be dynamic, multiple and contingent rather than causal, singular and able to be plotted on a linear trajectory.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Truth</field><field name="subject">Knowledge Management</field><field name="subject">Organisational behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the Erodibility of Earth Wall Units</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This investigation looked at the climatic variables affecting the durability of earth buildings and the relationship between these climatic variables and their laboratory counterparts, with the aim of providing a means whereby performance in the field under known climatic conditions can be predicted by performance in the laboratory.  The investigation showed that the major climatic factors influencing the erosion of earth walls due to wind-driven rain are impacting rainfall volume, drop impact velocity (as determined by wind conditions), raindrop size and duration of rainfall. A vertical rain gauge was calibrated with climatic conditions at a test site in Sydney to enable accurate prediction of the volume of water impacting test specimens. In the laboratory, a standard spray test was modified by introducing a commercially available nozzle, which produces a turbulent spray of individual drops, rather than a stream of water. Erosion rates using this apparatus were found to vary significantly with time, and a correction formula was derived from experimental results to enable comparison to be made between field and laboratory results. Erosion rates per unit volume of water were found to be proportional to impacting velocity raised to the power 2.5 and inversely proportional to the median drop diameter raised to the power 1.2. A material factor was defined as the 60 minute erosion mass loss divided by the 60 minute volume of impacting water spray. Field tests were carried out over a period of four years and analysed in relation to the associated laboratory test results. Laboratory testing was carried out on one half of split specimens, the other half being subjected to exposure to the weather at Sydney's International Airport, with regular monitoring of wind and rain records.  An empirical model was developed and was used to compare field and laboratory results.  This confirmed the importance of impacting volume of water and material factor but in this case the calculated correlation between field and laboratory erosions was not improved by the addition of impact velocity and drop size terms.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Earth Construction</field><field name="subject">Materials</field><field name="subject">Deterioration</field><field name="subject">Erosion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gaseous Secondary Electron Detection and Cascade Amplification in the Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis quantitatively investigates gaseous electron-ion recombination in an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) at a transient level by utilizing the dark shadows/streaks seen in gaseous secondary electron detector (GSED) images immediately after a region of enhanced secondary electron (SE) emission is encountered by a scanning electron beam. The investigation firstly derives a theoretical model of gaseous electron-ion recombination that takes into consideration transients caused by the time constant of the GSED electronics and external circuitry used to generate images. Experimental data of pixel intensity versus time of the streaks is then simulated using the model enabling the relative magnitudes of (i) ionization and recombination rates, (ii) recombination coefficients, and (iii) electron drift velocities, as well as absolute values of the total time constant of the detection system, to be determined as a function of microscope operating parameters. Results reveal the exact dependence that the effects of SE-ion recombination on signal formation have on reduced electric field intensity and time in ESEM. Furthermore, the model implicitly demonstrates that signal loss as a consequence of field retardation due to ion space charges, although obviously present, is not the foremost phenomenon causing streaking in images, as previously thought. Following that the generation and detection of gaseous scintillation and electro- luminescence produced via electron-gas molecule excitation reactions in ESEM is investigated. Here a novel gaseous scintillation detection (GSD) system is developed to efficiently detect photons produced. Images acquired using GSD are compared to those obtained using conventional GSED detection, and demonstrate that images rich in SE contrast can be achieved using such systems. A theoretical model is developed that describes the generation of photon signals by cascading SEs, high energy backscattered electrons (BSEs) and primary beam electrons (PEs). Photon amplification, or the total number of photons produced per sample emissive electron, is then investigated, and compared to conventional electronic amplification, over a wide range of microscope operating parameters, imaging gases and photon collection geometries. The main findings of the investigation revealed that detected electroluminescent signals exhibit larger SE signal-to-background levels than that of conventional electronic signals detected via GSED. Also, dragging the electron cascade towards the light pipe assemblage of GSD systems, or electrostatic focusing, dramatically increases photon collection efficiencies. The attainment of such an improvement being a direct consequence of increasing the `effective' solid angle for photon collection. Finally, in attempt to characterize the scintillating wavelengths arising from sample emissive SEs, PEs, BSEs, and their respective cascaded electrons, such that future photon filtering techniques can be employed to extract nominated GSD imaging signals, the emission spectra of commonly utilized electroluminescent gases in ESEM, such as argon (Ar) and nitrogen (N2), were collected and investigated. Spectra of Ar and N2 reveal several major emission lines that occur in the ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (NIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The major photon emissions discovered in Ar are attributed to occur via atomic de-excitation transitions of neutral Ar (Ar I), whilst for N2, major emissions are attributed to be a consequence of second positive band vibrational de-excitation reactions. Major wavelength intensity versus gas pressure data, for both Ar and N2, illustrate that wavelength intensities increase with decreasing pressure. This phenomenon strongly suggesting that quenching effects and reductions in excitation mean free paths increase with imaging gas pressure.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electron microscope</field><field name="subject">scanning</field><field name="subject">cascade</field><field name="subject">signal loss</field><field name="subject">gaseous</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Strategic Management of International Entrepreneurial Activities at Australian Universities</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Universities around the world are increasingly focusing on entrepreneurial activities.  In Australia, the growth of international entrepreneurial activities has resulted in the creation of a billion-dollar export-oriented sector.  These activities include the recruitment of international students to Australian campuses, the development of Australian university campuses in offshore locations, and the delivery of Australian degree programs at both onshore and offshore locations in partnership with universities, professional associations and private corporations.  Australian universities currently receive on average around seven percent of revenues from these sources, with some depending on international entrepreneurialism for as much as one-third of revenues.  Managing these activities in an efficient, effective and sustainable manner has thus become critically important to virtually every institution in the Australian higher education sector.  Long dependent on government funding, Australian universities have found the rise of international entrepreneurialism a significant shift.  As is the case when businesses become international, universities are faced with the need to manage the complexities, risks and challenges associated with international operations.  To date, little empirical work has been undertaken which explores and examines how Australian universities are managing their international entrepreneurial business operations.  The aim of this study is thus to respond to this research gap by exploring how Australian universities, particularly in terms of their Faculties of Business, organise and manage international entrepreneurial activities.  The research examines management approaches, practices and processes at five Australian universities.  Two are highly international, metropolitan universities recognised around the world as leaders in international entrepreneurialism.  Two are smaller, regional institutions, while the fifth  university is a medium-sized metropolitan institution which had in recent times moved aggressively to develop its international activities.  Document analysis, observation and interviews with senior institutional managers, academic managers and academics at each university revealed several common themes arising in institutional approaches.  These included an emphasis on diversified, offshore growth; a degree of movement towards structural centralisation, particularly in the highly international universities which had been historically highly decentralised; the presence of generally supportive organisational cultures; a perception among academic managers and academics that most international activities remain driven by financial imperatives; the perceived potential for detrimental impacts on academic research arising from increased involvement in international activities; the existence of a common concern among senior institutional managers for the effects of Faculty of Business dominance of international programs in their institutions; a tendency for most organisational learning to be informal, except in the highly international institutions; and a preference for decentralised strategic leadership which included a degree of oversight by internationally experienced senior institutional managers.  A Strategic Advantage Model of Internationalisation is presented representing a theoretical and conceptual synthesis of the findings.  Building on previous work undertaken in the field, the model focuses on the need for institutions to achieve best practice and competitive advantage through the leveraging of organisational and strategic competencies, the pursuit of executional advantages, the implementation of strategically decentralised leadership and the development of international business competencies.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Universities and colleges</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">International Business Enterprises</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negotiating Place in Colonial Darwin. Interactions between Aborigines and Whites 1869-1911</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis draws on the documentary historical record to examine the interactions between the indigenous Larrakia people and the white settlers in the colonial township of Darwin between the years 1869 and 1911.  The colonial recognition of the Larrakia as the traditional owners of lands in the Darwin region and the historical question of their land rights is discussed in some detail.  Rather than seeing interactions between the Larrakia and the colonisers as polarised into either accommodation or resistance, this thesis looks at various interactions to highlight the complexities of the encounter.  One of the more complex of their interactions was the negotiation of what is best described as an abstruse alliance which benefited both the Larrakia and the colonisers in various ways.  The colonisation of the Darwin region had a considerable impact on the Larrakia people's ability to live on their country as they had done prior to the invasion.  This thesis seeks to understand the negotiations, compromises and decisions the Larrakia made to survive in their changing landscape.  Another complexity that is highlighted in this thesis is the tension within the white settler population about how to deal with what was presented as the 'Aboriginal problem'.  This thesis shows that the ideology of compensating Aboriginal people for having invaded their land and undermining their means of subsistence was understood and condoned by the colonisers.  The distribution of government rations, the allocation of reserves and the ongoing recognition of the Larrakia's right to be within the township were all ways that some colonisers attempted to compensate Aborigines for invading their land.  This thesis shows that while the Larrakia people were recognised as the prior occupants of Darwin and, as such, accorded a distinct status within the township in the whole period under study, the colonisers ultimately failed to give tangible expression to the Larrakia's land rights.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">Northern Territory</field><field name="subject">Darwin (N.T)</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contingency planning models for Government agencies</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This report describes a research study into the current situation within Federal, State Government and selected private sector agencies, assessing contingency plans for Information Systems and suggests models for state-wide planning against Information Systems disasters. Following a brief look at various phases of contingency plan development, the study looks into the factors that prompt organisations to prepare contingency plans. The project involved a survey of current Information Systems contingency plans in the government agencies in the states of Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and in the Australian Capital Territory. It also included two major banks, an insurance company and two computer services bureaux in the private sector within New South Wales. The survey determined that particular factors play important roles in the decision by organisations to commence contingency planning. These include actual disaster experience, senior management support, auditor's comments, legal requirements, risk analysis and business impact study, economic considerations, insurance requirements, contract commitment, new staff and introduction of new hardware and software. The critical success factors in contingency planning include regular maintenance and testing of the plan. The project also discusses the current contingency planning environment within New South Wales Government agencies and suggests cost-effective models for state-wide adoption.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information resources management</field><field name="subject">Security measures</field><field name="subject">Emergency management</field><field name="subject">Business enterprises</field><field name="subject">Computer networks</field><field name="subject">Administrative agencies</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Daunorubicin Kinetics and Drug Resistance in Leukaemia</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The aims of this thesis were to examine: (1) plasma and cellular pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin and its major metabolite daunorubicinol in patients with acute leukaemia, and the relationships between pharmacokinetics, patient response and the presence of P glycoprotein; (2) actions of the multidrug resistance reversing agents cyclosporin A and trifluoperazine, at clinically achievable concentrations, on daunorubicin accumulation and retention in human leukaemia cell lines and patients with acute leukaemia; and (3) effect of daunorubicin on the cell membrane of both sensitive and resistant cell lines, with and without the multidrug resistance reversing agents. Twenty-seven patients with acute leukaemia received daunorubicin as part of induction therapy. The plasma and cellular levels of daunorubicin and its metabolite daunorubicinol were determined using HPLC. There were no significant differences between patients who went into complete remission (12 out of 23) compared to those who did not respond for any of the plasma pharmacokinetic parameters. There was a significant difference in the cellular daunorubicin and daunorubicinol area under the concentration-time curve between responders and non responders (p less than 0.02), as well as in cellular Cmax, cellular clearance and cellular volume of distribution. Eleven patients were P glycoprotein positive and 10 P glycoprotein negative (no sample available for 2 patients). There was no correlation between patient response and the presence of P glycoprotein; nor a correlation between the cellular concentration of daunorubicin or daunorubicinol and P glycoprotein. Patients responding to chemotherapy had higher cellular daunorubicin and daunorubicinol compared to non responders. In contrast to in vitro studies, overexpression of P glycoprotein was not the reason for the lower cellular daunorubicin levels. Cyclosporin A was capable of increasing both cellular accumulation and retention in the drug resistant CEM/VLB and HL 60/ADR cell lines, but not in the drug sensitive CEM and HL 60 cell lines. Trifluoperazine had no effect in any of the four cell lines. In contrast to the cell line findings, only the combination of cyclosporin A and trifluoperazine were able to increase both accumulation and retention in the blast cells of patients at initial presentation. The multidrug resistant reversing agents alone had no effect in increasing accumulation or retention in the blast cells of P glycoprotein positive patients, nor patients in relapse. The cell line studies show that at clinically relevant concentrations only cyclosporin A is capable of increasing daunorubicin accumulation in both the drug resistant P glycoprotein positive (VLB) and P glycoprotein negative (ADR) cell lines. Thus, cyclosporin A does not work only by inhibiting the actions of P glycoprotein. Trifluoperazine was unable to reverse drug resistance at clinically relevant concentrations in either cell lines or patient blast cells. However, the combination of cyclosporin A and trifluoperazine increased accumulation in patient blast cells at initial presentation, suggesting that these agents may be more useful in patients at initial presentation than relapse.  Daunorubicin was immobilised by linking it to poly vinyl alcohol and the effect of immobilised-daunorubicin was studied on the four cell lines above. The immobilised-daunorubicin was able to decrease cell growth in the drug sensitive HL 60 cell line but not in the drug resistant VLB or ADR cell lines. Poly vinyl alcohol itself was cytotoxic to the CEM cell line. The multidrug resistance reversing agents cyclosporin A and trifluoperazine were only capable of increasing cytotoxicity in the HL 60 cell line, with no effect in the drug resistant VLB or ADR cell lines.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pharmacokinetics</field><field name="subject">Acute Leukaemia - Treatment</field><field name="subject">daunorubicin</field><field name="subject">cyclosporin</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Numerical Study of a Rotary Valve Internal Combustion Engine</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of the Bishop Rotary Valve (BRV) engine is developed. The simulation used an existing commercial CFD code, CFX 4.3, with a number of new routines written to allow it to simulate the conditions and motions involved in an internal combustion engine. The code is extensively validated using results from other researchers, and several new validations are performed to directly validate the code for simulating internal combustion engine flows. Firstly, tumble vortex breakdown during the compression stroke of a square piston model engine is modelled. The results of the simulation are validated against published high quality experimental data. Both two- and three-dimensional models are tested, using the k-e and Reynolds stress turbulence models. The Reynolds stress turbulence model simulations successfully predicted the tumble break down process during the compression stroke. A simple three-dimensional Large Eddy Simulation model is also presented. The numerical simulation is then applied to the BRV engine. An in-cylinder flow field not previously described is discovered, created by the unique combustion chamber shape of the BRV engine. The flow field is not adequately described by the traditional descriptions of engine flows, being squish, swirl and tumble. The new flow structure is named 'dual cross tumble', and is characterised by two counter-rotating vortices in the cross tumble plane on either side of the inlet air jet. Analysis of the dual tumble structure indicates that it is most beneficial in high bore to stroke ratio engines. This flow structure has been predicted or visualised by a small number of previous researchers, however no published research has recognised its significance or potential benefits. The validated code is then used to predict the effect of modifying the valve cross sectional area, the effect of the inlet manifold wave, the effect of heat transfer from the inlet manifold walls, the effect of bore to stroke ratio, and the effect of engine speed. This work presents a numerical simulation of a new rotary valve engine technology. This opens up a whole new area of engine aerodynamics research as no detailed examination of the flows in a rotary valve engine have been presented previously. In the process, it discovers a new compression stroke turbulence generation mechanism, 'dual cross tumble', which offers the potential of performance levels not possible using poppet valve engines.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internal Combustion Engines</field><field name="subject">Mathematical Models</field><field name="subject">Fluid Dynamics</field><field name="subject">Valves</field><field name="subject">Design and Construction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Glittering Thread: The 1954 Royal Tour of Australia</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis is a broadly-based historical study of the 1954 Royal Tour of Australia. In presenting an anatomy of this important but neglected event, it attempts to restore its place in history, to explain the nature of the enduring popular attachment to the British Royal Family, to examine the self-portrait that Australia presented to its Royal visitors in the post-war era and to investigate the political and cultural processes by which it did so. The primary theoretical aim of this detailed case study is to interrogate the means by which the State (represented by the Parliament and the state and federal bureaucracies, with the cooperation of the media) was able to secure the willing participation of an overwhelming majority of the population. The elements of this study are drawn principally from government archives, the vast media coverage of the day, extensive oral history interviews with participants, and academic literature in the areas of Australian history (with particular reference to the nineteen-fifties), popular royalism, popular culture, public memory, civic ritual and spectacle. It was my final objective that these elements and aims might be synthesised into an enjoyable, 'popular' account of this chaotic, surprising and memorable event.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visits of State</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Royal Visitors</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Eye of The Storm. An Integral perspective on  Sustainable Development and Climate Change Response</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">In this thesis, I explore the implications of integral theory for sustainable development and climate change response. Integral theory seeks to integrate objective and subjective perspectives using a developmental orientation. It addresses issues of subjectivity that have received inadequate attention in mainstream approaches to sustainable development, while also providing theoretical grounding for the developmental aspect of sustainable development. According to integral theory, there are four main epistemological approaches to any problem: behavioural, systemic, psychological and cultural. The first is objective and individual, the second objective and collective, the third subjective and individual and the fourth subjective and collective. Development occurs within each of these realms. To test the value and implications of integral theory for sustainable development, I adopt a case study on climate change response in Australia. I begin the case study by using the four perspectives of integral theory to guide a review of the energy and climate change literature. I follow the literature review with a critical review of Australian energy and greenhouse policy, providing the starting point for development of an integral climate change response. While there is attention to subjectivity in the literature, it is not reflected in Australian policy practices. An objective perspective and an instrumental form of rationality dominate policy. In the literature review, I identify two gaps in the literature that deserve attention. The first is the role of public subsidies in creating the observed cost differential between renewable energy sources and fossil fuel energy. I examine the relative magnitude of subsidies to fossil fuels and renewable energy in the Australian energy and transport sectors and conclude that the distribution of these subsidies distorts the market in favour of fossil fuels, particularly in the transport sector. The second is the application of a developmental perspective to cultural theories of climate policy discourse. I introduce a method called meta-discourse analysis to identify consistencies and relationships across discourse descriptions by different authors and demonstrate that aspects of each discourse can be related developmentally.  Drawing on the literature review, policy review and other work, I propose an integral policy response to climate change that could be applied in Australia. The policy response combines participatory integrated assessment, normative futures work, a modified version of the cooperative discourse model for public participation, an evolutionary policy orientation and several methods to promote subjective development. The proposed policy approach should be equally applicable to other sustainable development issues.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable Development</field><field name="subject">Climate Response Change</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Aristotelian Construction of the Social Economy of Land</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Aristotle's metaphor for economic relations was the household. Although the household is engaged in the material activities of internal production, consumption and exchange which are economic, its fundamental connections are social. Social dynamics, including care, respect, authority, loyalty, charity and self-restraint are the motivations within the household. These are all virtues in Aristotelian terms and can be grouped under the more general social virtue of solidarity which is the intention to act in support and draw closer to the other in relationship in such a way as to become more perfectly human. An economics based on this family metaphor will be socially grounded, it is social economics. A key identifier of social economics is its capacity to realise the common good. This thesis is an examination of the contribution of property in land to the common good leading to the identification of the location of land within social economics.  An Aristotelian methodology has been adopted for this thesis, following an examination of its component parts and comparison with alternative methodologies. While the defense of the methodology is not exhaustive, it is sufficient to provide reasonable justification of Aristotelian realism and point out some of the shortcomings of competing approaches. Aristotelian realism is accepted as employing an acceptance of essences, the validity of abstraction, and the importance of observation. Contrasted to positivism, Aristotelian realism accepts knowledge that is not simply observation-based, especially the possibility of the knowledge of essences.   Property theory has been reviewed. This includes ancient positions on property as well as modern. Islamic property theory has been included in the review in order to broaden the cultural base. Ancient  Western property theories have been been shown to be divided between simple acceptance of the fact of private ownership, especially evident in Roman law and early modern practice, and a more complex theory of ownership first articulated by Aristotle. Aristotle's theory of ownership was a dual principle of private ownership but common use. The Aristotelian position was developed by St. Thomas Aquinas in the Medieval period. St. Thomas recognised that property in external property was naturally for common use but privately owned by convention. John Locke attempted a labour based theory of absolute private property and Adam Smith returned to the positive fact of possession. The Islamic position straddled the Lockean and Thomistic. Modern property theory is a development of the Smithian identification property as a fact of society.  Apart from the institution of individual private property in land, several other economic institutions mark modern Western economics. The most important of these is the free market. The theoretical foundations of the free market have been examined and have been found to be based on moral foundations. The components of market theory have been reviewed and significant shortcomings have been revealed. The theory of supply has been found to contradict practice and the commonly portrayed market functions that are asserted to depict market behaviour in efficient circumstances have been shown be in error. Capitalisation has also been reviewed and its dependence on the risk-free real rate of return on money loans has been explored. The moral problem of usury has been introduced and linked to capitalisation, but not taken beyond recognition and defense of the fact that it is a social artifact rather than a product of economic forces.  The critical factor in the operation of the market was shown to be its inclusion of demand in the development of prices. In the absence of theoretical support, the acceptability of the market was tested empirically by surveying attitudes to demand based pricing. Three hundred and forty Sydney home-owners were asked ten questions regarding situations where prices and profits were linked to demand or price. The data was analysed and found to lend support to the hypothesis that demand-based pricing did not have community support. A general theory of property was constructed from human nature and the nature of land. It was then used to develop an ethical structure for the pricing of wages, land and products. It was argued that property rights in labour were fundamentally different to property rights in land, the former being natural and the latter being conventional. It was also evident that the market was an inappropriate instrument for the determination of wages, but appropriate for the determination of commodity prices. Land was recognised to be the gap between wage price and commodity price.  Ricardo's rent theory was reviewed as a mechanism for pricing land income. Various aspects and implications were considered and it was recognised that in a closed land market the returns to land competed with the return to labour in a manner that was better explained in political terms than economic. Despite its importance in social economy, the operation of Ricardian rent theory is obscured other mediating factors. It has also been used as the central theory in a protracted political debate over the taxation of land. Both of these issues have contributed to the the marginalisation of interest in rent theory and a degree of suspicion as to its validity.  A behavioural experiment was run to examine the validity of Ricardian rent theory within the confines of its own assumptions, which are basically those of an efficient market and the recognition that land has varying productivity. The results of the experiment lent strong support to the theory but highlighted the conventional nature of the return to labour. One of the shortcomings of Ricardian rent theory is its assertions regarding subsistence wages, and there was evidence in the experiment that did not support this aspect of the theory. The significance and construction of subsistence wages were specifically reviewed and also other sources of economic rents. An analysis of non-land economic rents revealed that they were either land-like, transient or politically maintained. A theory of supply was developed from a rent base that was argued to be causally accurate and returned a monotonic upward curve consistent with practical observation.  The implications of the political economy of the findings were reviewed. Some major traditions in economics interpreted in terms of the ethical issues revealed. The thesis concluded that many cultural resolutions of the property problem are possible, however they must conform to ethical fundamentals that may be paraphrased in the notion of solidarity. Suggestions for possible corrections or improvements to specific existing practices and policies were developed.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Land Use</field><field name="subject">Social Aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">History of the Sydney Film Festival 1954-1983</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study is intended to provide a record of the founding and development of one of Australia's oldest and longest surviving film festivals and to determine the nature and impact of the Festival in its engagement with other cultural, social, and political institutions over the thirty years from 1954 to 1983. I have taken my research from a variety of sources, primarily the archive of Sydney Film Festival papers and ephemera lodged at Mitchell Library, Sydney. I have utilized a number of publications from the period, including daily newspapers, trade papers and specialist film and art journals. These give some indication of the Festival's influence and impact within the wider community and help position it in terms of predominant cultural and social values. I conclude that the Sydney Film Festival has played a significant, and so far somewhat underestimated, role in the development of Australian film culture and industry, and has influenced the nature and reception of films in commercial distribution within the country. In a pedagogical sense, it has influenced contemporary understanding of film and film history, in part by privileging particular movements and filmmakers over others and in part by creating a communal and interactive environment in which films, filmmaking and other aspects of film culture can be discussed, analysed and celebrated. This is a history of an organisation whose membership included some of the major figures in Australian film and related media and I have been committed to bringing a human element to the events and issues explored. To this end, I have utilized the extensive Oral History archive created in 1992 by the Sydney Film Festival in order to commemorate its fortieth anniversary. As is often the case with historical research, some of these personal memories are in conflict with one another and with the documentary record. By a process of referencing and cross referencing, I hope I have arrived at an approximation of a truth about a moment in the life of an Australian cultural icon.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sydney Film Festival</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Policies and Discourses of Vocational Education and Training : and their impact on the formation of teachers' identities.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Education and training, in Australia, has experienced unprecedented levels of change in recent times. Government educational policies are now dominated by economic discourses that point to the need for all educational systems to contribute to economic development, by increasing the knowledge and skill levels of the present and future workforce. The twin discourses of new vocationalism and economic rationalism have now transformed Australian educational systems. But the effects of this transformation on the identities of teachers working in this changed environment have not been adequately examined. This study examines the impact of government policies on teachers' identities by investigating a particular group of teachers working in Technical and Further Education (TAFE) in Australia. The study has chosen teacher identity as its focus, because much of recent research has involved investigating the new knowledge and skills required of teachers working in this changed environment. However, this can be seen as making an overly instrumental means-ends connection between teachers' knowledge and skills and the professional practice of teaching. It fails to appreciate that when teachers are asked to 'do things differently' in their everyday teaching practices they are also being called on to become different teachers. That is, to have different understandings of their role in education, to have different relationships with students, to conceptualise their professional and vocational knowledge differently. In short, to change their identity. In order to investigate the impact of the policies and discourses of VET on TAFE teachers' identities the study locates itself, in part, within the interpretivist tradition of social research and uses the methods and methodologies of critical policy analysis, phenomenology and ethnography to investigate the research questions. It then uses a number of diverse theoretical perspectives to challenge and interrogate the interpretation made of the data gathered. The study undertakes a critical analysis of contemporary VET policies utilising a 'policy -as-discourse' approach to the analysis and draws on the methods of phenomenology and ethnography in order to generate situated discourses that are often overlooked in critical policy analysis. The study also uses the perspective offered by poststructuralism, which foregrounds the power of discourse in the formation of both the social world and individual identity. The conclusions reached suggest that TAFE teacher identity is an ambiguous discursive achievement constructed out of the multiple, historical organisational and individual discourses that all circulate in teachers' life worlds. These discourses now interact in complex and contradictory ways with the contemporary policies and discourses of vocational education and training resulting in teachers experiencing a degree of doubt and uncertainty concerning their identification with the new institution of TAFE.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vocational education</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Teachers.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School-Museum Integrated Learning Experiences in Science: A learning journey</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The focus of this dissertation is my investigation into how primary school teachers can be guided to provide effective conditions for student learning on teacher-led school excursions to museums.  The dissertation follows my learning journey, beginning with my entering experiences as a teacher, museum educator and teacher educator and then following stages of literature search, questions, action and reflection.  The research design has affinity with action research and utilises an assemblage of methodologies which are empathetic with the study itself, principally observations and interviews.  My thesis is that a framework based on strategies which reflect informal learning behaviours of family groups, learner-centred teaching approaches, and meaningful integration of school and museum studies, can create favourable conditions for student learning on excursions.  Further, with minimal professional development, classroom teachers can implement such a framework.  The first of three field studies tested my understandings about current practices on teacher-led school excursions to museums.  Observations of 12 school excursions in Sydney, Australia, revealed a strong teacher orientation toward task completion rather than learning, and underlined the need to search for an alternative approach.  Following a literature search on school visits to museums, social constructivist learning and teaching, and family visits, a School-Museum Learning Framework (SMLF) was designed. The SMLF was trialed in the second field study in which I was the principal teacher as well as researcher, working with a Year 5/6 class.  The most significant finding was the students' recognition and declaration of their own learning in an environment in which they had choice and ownership of their learning.  Consideration of the nature and measurement of learning in informal settings led to a tentative tool for indicating engagement in learning processes. In my third field study I investigated the broader application of the SMLF in four trials involving seven teachers.  The teachers participated in a one-day professional development seminar and then conducted their own school-museum programs.  The results showed the SMLF to be robust under a range of circumstances.  My findings from the trials led to a refined flexible framework: School-Museum Integrated Learning Experiences in Science, which is based on three Guiding Principles: integration of school and museum learning; provision of conditions for self-directed learning and facilitation of learning strategies appropriate to the setting.  The findings from this research have significance for students, teachers, teacher educators and museum educators.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Museums and schools</field><field name="subject">Science museums</field><field name="subject">Museums educational aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Midwifery in New Zealand 1990-2003: the complexities of service provision.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This Professional Doctorate in Midwifery explores the development of maternity services in New Zealand subsequent to legislative changes in 1990 enabling midwives to provide the same services as doctors and access the same funding for the provision of care for childbearing women. The papers in this portfolio describe and analyse challenges faced by New Zealand midwives in achieving their full potential as autonomous health professionals and the strategies they developed to survive within a healthcare environment that despite changes, remained medicalised. Throughout this portfolio, a theoretical framework based on complexity theory provides a lens for critique of the varying challenges to midwifery development and strategies to progress the profession. The seven papers that make up this portfolio were developed and written over a five-year period from 1999 to 2003. During this time I was involved in various activities supporting midwifery in New Zealand, including the establishment of a postgraduate midwifery programme and participation in the refocusing of both the New Zealand College of Midwives and the Midwifery and Maternity Provider Organisation. These activities took me to various parts of the country, enabling me to maintain contact with midwives from a variety of settings. The first paper sets the scene for the portfolio by exploring the socio-political context of contemporary midwifery in New Zealand. The second paper tracks the emergence of a theoretical framework out of Complexity theory and presents a set of principles, which guide the critique of midwifery services and professional development, explored in the subsequent papers. Part Three documents the development of a contextual scanning tool, used to analyse the organisation of maternity care by midwives in rural settings. Part Four presents the findings of the scan and strategies for consolidating the role of midwives as key providers of maternity services in rural localities. Part Five documents the development of a programme for optimising midwifery leadership within the health sector, while Part Six explores the risks and opportunities for midwives with the development of clinical governance strategies by District Health Boards. Part seven focuses on strategies to increase the potential for midwives to consolidate, maintain and further develop community-based maternity services throughout the country. This portfolio provides an organisational analysis of contemporary maternity services in New Zealand and presents a multifaceted approach to securing midwifery as a key health profession and midwives as the main provider of maternity services to women in this country. The findings of this collection of works, identified midwifery in New Zealand as precariously positioned within a rapidly changing health service environment. While appearing most vulnerable, midwifery within the rural and primary settings appeared to offer the most potential for innovative development in order to secure the place of midwives as the prime providers of health care for women in childbirth.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwives</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">20th Century</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">LEDs and Doped Polymer Light Guides for Efficient Illumination and Colour Engineering</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This project involves the study of optical properties of polymers doped with TRIMM (transparent refractive index matched micro-particles), and their uses in light guides. The refractive index difference between dopant and host material is small (0.02), so forward transmittance is high, and losses due to backscattering are negligible. Flexible polymer optical fibre (POF) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) rods are being incorporated into an increasing range of lighting and light mixing applications. For energy efficient mixing of red, green and blue (RGB) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to produce white light and a range of other colours, light is transmitted from the end of a light guide ('endlight').  A major problem here is solved, namely the achievement of uniform illumination, simultaneously with low losses from scattering. Light output from RGB LEDs is shown to be completely mixed by short TRIMM-doped light guides. Alternatively, long lengths of TRIMM-doped POF can be used for 'side-light'. The concentration of TRIMM for these is chosen such that light is emitted from the side walls of the guide to give even illumination along its length.  A geometrical method of ray tracing in particle-doped rectangular and cylindrical light guides is derived, and Monte Carlo ray tracing simulations performed for undoped and TRIMM-doped light guides. The evolution of the distribution of ray angles, internal and external to a light guide, with propagation distance are studied. Computer simulations of angular distribution of light emitted from the wall of POF agree with measurements performed using a photogoniometer.  Simulations and measurements of light output intensity and colour from RGB LED arrays when projected from the end of a mixing rod, are also presented. Colour calculations agree with photometric measurements of RGB LED output from clear and TRIMM-doped PMMA mixing rods. Results of transmittance measurements and computer simulations show that light losses are almost entirely due to Fresnel reflectance from the entrance and exit surfaces of the rods. Photogoniometer measurements of the angular distribution of light from LEDs are used as a basis for LED source models used in ray tracing simulations. Results of an investigation comparing the effect of using a smoothed LED source model instead of measurement-based models on simulated light output distributions are presented. The light output from LEDs can have sudden peaks in intensity at certain angles, resulting in distinctive patterns with clear colour separation, after mixing in clear polymer mixing rods. These caustic patterns are eliminated by using TRIMM-doped mixing rods, with a transmittance of 90% after Fresnel losses, which can be readily reduced.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optical Properties</field><field name="subject">Light Emitting Diodes</field><field name="subject">Polymers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disabling Journeys: the social relations of tourism for people with impairments in Australia - an analysis of government tourism authorities and accommodation sector practice and discourses</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis explores the citizenship rights of people with disabilities and their experience in relation to one activity and industry - tourism. It is proposed that people with disabilities living in Australia have been excluded, oppressed and disadvantaged by government, tourism authorities (TA) and tourism industry (TI), practice and discourses. This exclusion, oppression and disadvantage has been perpetrated by the government, tourism authorities and tourism industry, whose practices and discourses do not provide an equality of service provision for the group. From this position the central question addressed is:  To what extent are the tourism patterns and experiences of people with impairments in Australia unduly constrained by tourism authorities and tourism industry practice and discourse?  In taking direction from the social model of disability (Oliver 1990), the proposition deliberately uses the word impairments rather than disabilities as both a definitional and conceptual approach to the research. This is because the question tests whether the social relations produce the constraints that people with impairments face in negotiating tourism experiences and, hence, create disabling journeys. In other words, the disabling social relations transform the impaired person to the person with a disability in the tourism context. 'Unduly' means that people with disabilities were not provided with an equality of service provision in comparison to the non-disabled.  The research design and methodology involves inductive inquiry utilising both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. This includes a multiple methodological approach involving secondary data analysis of major national and regional surveys, content/discourse analysis, in-depth interviews and a focus group. The secondary data sources involved the Disability, Ageing and Carers Survey (ABS 1993; 1998 n=42,000), National Visitors Survey (BTR 1998 n=78,000) and Anxiety to Access (Tourism NSW 1998 n=2647). A content analysis is undertaken of the HREOC (2002) complaint cases, public hearings, public inquiries, disability action plans and disability Standards projects relevant to tourism. A content analysis is also undertaken of tourism authorities' disability tourism initiatives from 1990-2000. In depth interviews are undertaken with three separate populations that include people with disabilities (n=15), accommodation managers (n=10) and responsible officers from tourism authorities (n=3). A focus group of accommodation managers (n=23) is also undertaken. The data are analysed and interpreted using binary logistic regression, ordinal logistic regression, phenomenology, grounded theory and discourse analysis.  The central argument to emerge from this thesis is that disability is a social relationship - or rather a complex set of social relationships - between people with disabilities, and the organisations that control and administer the institutional and social environments in which they live. Tourism represents an important arena for social and cultural participation. Given the commitment by governments to 'reduce disability' it is thus critical to consider whether the relationships in the area of tourism are disabling or enabling. The thesis shows that the practices and discourses of tourism authorities and the tourism industry unduly constrain the tourism opportunities and experiences of people with impairments in Australia and create disabling journeys.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism.</field><field name="subject">Government policy.</field><field name="subject">People with disabilities.</field><field name="subject">Discrimination.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of imagination in autobiography and transformative learning</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">By telling and retelling their life stories in everyday social interaction, adult learners describe times of continuity and change in their lives, and give an account of their self-formation. A disjuncture between the learners' life stories and events experienced either in their social context or in their inner life invites their reflection on its significance. Transformative learning occurs when reflection on such experience leads to interpretations which change the learners' meaning perspectives and their social practice. These changes are incorporated into a new version of the life story. Adult education approaches to perspective transformation have generally emphasised the interpretive role of critical reflection and thinking. Autobiography, as a metaphor for transformative learning, proposes that transformative learning also has the quality of a narrative constructed with imagination. Through ongoing interpretation of events in their inner and outer experience, learners compose their lives and their life stories. The social context is a dynamic setting for autobiographical learning. Its structures and institutions concretise the learners' social and cultural tradition, which has been shaped by design and historical circumstance. Through the prejudgments of their tradition, learners perceive reality and construct corresponding lives and life stories. Theoretical approaches to interpreting life experience differ in their estimation of the value of the learners' tradition. In adult education theory and practice, Habermas' critical theory has been enlisted as a conceptual basis for perspective transformation. Little attention has been afforded to either Gadamer's hermeneutic consciousness, or Ricoeur's critical hermeneutics as ways to understand the interpretive activity which leads to the learners' self-formation and the re-invention of their life story. Six former Roman Catholic priests participated in a cooperative inquiry, telling their life stories of remarkable change in life choice. They sought deeper self-knowledge, as well as an understanding of the widespread social phenomenon of Catholic priests choosing to marry. Their autobiographical accounts indicate that, as they gradually composed new life narratives, these learners gained personal authority as the authors of their lives. The stories also indicate that, at one time or other, a state of stagnation developed in the authors' lives. Despite the learners' lengthy periods of consciously attempting to resolve the stalemate, it was an act of spontaneous imagination which illuminated a way through. The explanatory understanding of autobiographical or transformative learning proposed here claims that imagination, which bridges the domains of conscious and unconscious knowing in the author, is a partner with critical reflection in interpreting the life in its social context. Through transformative or hermeneutic conversation, adult educators may foster and promote the formation of autobiography and transformative learning. Further research, linking autobiography and transformative learning, would purposefully explore the role of other internal processes in transformative learning, such as feeling, and examine their relationship with imagination. It is likely that the acknowledgment of imagination as integral to transformative learning would lead to research which considers models of personhood other than those which emphasise ego as the conscious director of knowing and learning.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autobiographical memory</field><field name="subject">Imagination</field><field name="subject">Adult learning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/261</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining Educational Aspects with New Technology: Teaching Basic Statistics Using Hypermedia</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The increasing popularity and rapid development of the Internet and specifically the World-Wide Web in recent years has led to an exponential growth of users around the world in many different application areas. Following this growing trend, many eager educators have also embraced this new technology and have begun to use it as a tool in delivering education. A plethora of applications has already been developed in an attempt to implement educational content in this way. A general concern for many researchers is that most of these applications are not efficient in delivering educational outcomes and fail to achieve their educational goal. In the present project we propose that the present failure to deliver educational outcomes in an efficient way has its origins in the lack of concern and focus of developers on modern learning theory. Therefore, in this work we establish the foundations in terms of an interdisciplinary contribution from areas such as, educational learning theory, human-computer interaction and web design guidelines for the design and implementation of web pages aimed at facilitating the teaching and tutoring of basic statistics concepts. As a result of this work, a specific set of learning theories were researched and analyzed, the basic ideas of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) were explored and a set of appropriate principles from HCI were chosen. Furthermore, a selected group of Web design guidelines were researched, studied and selected to ensure that the final product contributes to the efficient delivery of subject content and effective achievement of learning outcomes. In addition, a number of parallels were formulated and discussed between the different areas of research. The establishment of a series of combined principles will not only contribute to the aims of the present project but also to further projects initiated by the Department of Econometrics at The University Sydney.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="subject">Computer-assisted instruction</field><field name="subject">Interactive multimedia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical Aspects Of The Continuously Varying Schedule Process For Timber Drying</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Drying of timber increases its durability and strength. Therefore, timber should be dried to a moisture content close to the equilibrium moisture content it will attain in service. The drying of timber from its natural green state to the required moisture content is thus an important part of the production cycle. Hardwood species, due to their macroscopic structures, are more difficult to dry as compared to softwood.  A great deal of research has centred in recent years on developing a fast drying process for softwood; on the other hand, there is a need for a process to dry hardwood rapidly. A new drying technique, called Continuously Varying Schedule (CVS) was recently developed by the author for the purpose of rapidly drying the medium to high density hardwood.  The investigation described herein was carried out to compare the CVS process with the conventional drying process. The factors compared were drying time, quality of timber produced and the energy consumed.  It was found that the CVS process reduced the drying time by 34.5% and saved 30.7% of the energy. It produced also, a competitive dried timber quality. The process achieved highly efficient drying, as the rate of drying (MC%/h x 100) was 80.3% higher than the conventional process and also, the amount of water evaporated per unit of drying time (g/h) was 67.1% higher. The CVS drying performance has achieved a 71.9% increase in the amount of moisture content reduced per unit of energy (MC%/kWh x 100) and a 57.8% increase in the amount of water evaporated per unit of energy (g/kWh) as compared to the conventional process.  Much emphasis was placed on energy saving in the drying plant and it was suggested that a heat exchanger be used to recover waste energy from the exhausted air of the kiln. A dehumidifier coupled to a solar-powered system, backed up with an electric or wood waste booster, was recommended as a low-cost energy drying plant. An alternative source to the petroleum-based energy was also discussed.  The study of air flow through the timber stack in the kiln was a major part of this investigation as it is one of the principal features of the CVS process. A new technique was developed to measure the air velocity and the turbulence level %. The technique involves the integration of a hot wire anemometer, data logger, computer and computer peripherals. The air velocity profiles for twelve fan speeds, between 400 and 2200 rpm, were drawn by a computer graphical program, using data collected by the above circuit. It was obvious that the boundary layer which exists around the timber surface at the low air velocity protects the timber being processed against the high and continuously increasing temperature during the CVS drying process.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Timber</field><field name="subject">Lumber</field><field name="subject">Drying</field><field name="subject">Forest Products Industry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epiphanies: An Existential Philosophical and Psychological Enquiry</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The purpose of this inquiry is to investigate the relatively under-researched and under- developed nature of positive change and transformation that is sudden and abrupt, as defined by the term epiphany. A review of the literature across the disciplines of sociology, literary studies, education and psychology pertaining to epiphanies revealed a modest and disparate body of knowledge. As yet only two studies to date have developed and tested a conceptual framework describing and explaining epiphanies, both situated in the theoretical perspectives of developmental, clinical, cognitive and behavioural psychology. Due to the sparseness of the epiphanic literature, a thorough review was undertaken, producing a set of six core characteristics, which were tested and interpreted from a self-identity existential perspective. Existential philosophy and psychology provide an understanding of human experiences based on personal meaning and the essential realities of the human condition. In order to encapsulate an existential theory of knowledge, a narrative approach to methodology was employed to collect, analyse and interpret participants' epiphanies, from which three main conclusions were drawn. Firstly, an epiphany is a profound illumination of the inauthentic and authentic modes of self-identity, which provide the impetus for a more honest and courageous encounter with the conditions of existence. Secondly, the participants' life-stories illustrate that an epiphany is a valid experience as indicated by support for the set of six core characteristics developed from the literature. Lastly, an epiphany is an intentional experience made significant and enduring by the ascription of personal meaning.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">epiphanies</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">existential</field><field name="subject">philosophical</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/264</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rhetoric and Reality: Narrowing the Gap in Australian Midwifery</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study draws on multiple modes of expression in texts that have been generated by my experience of midwifery development since I moved from England to Australia in early 1997. The Professional Doctorate in Midwifery at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) has enabled me to produce and study my work as a midwifery practitioner, researcher, educator, writer and activist and to engage in a process of scholarship that both informs and is generated by practice. This has allowed me to analyse the complex issues that I, and other midwives in Australia, face as we strategise to narrow the gap between our ideals and the realities of the professional and political constraints that challenge midwifery. The study analyses the rhetorical communications I have employed as both carriers of 'vision' and 'means of persuasion' and the deliberate strategies to make changes that I believe will benefit childbearing women.   My portfolio challenges me and others, to explore how we are able to identify, enact, and convince others of the emancipatory potential of midwifery.  Rhetorical innovations are therefore linked to the exposition of woman centred midwifery care; an overall goal being to enable situations in which women can experience the potential power that transforms lives, through their experiences of childbirth. In the process, I aim to produce new knowledge that will equip midwives to understand practice, policy and political situations and see new possibilities for responding and taking action.  I have analysed and explained my work using a framework appropriated from rhetorical theory and drawing on a range of feminist perspectives. This involves identifying and critiquing the rhetorical innovations that I have used when trying to create possibilities and persuade others of the value of midwifery and the need to make changes happen in practice, education and regulation.  My study analyses the rhetorical nature of my own work as presented in my portfolio in a range of carefully selected texts that I have authored during my candidature. These include journal and newsletter articles, conference papers, research activities, policy submissions, education and training materials, the development of midwifery standards, formal and informal communications, and other documents, all aimed in one way or another at the rhetorical strategy of stimulating interest and action. The portfolio texts that arise from this work form the empirical data that is studied. However, in varying ways these texts elicit understandings about the rhetoric and reality of Australian midwifery and the deliberate strategies that are employed by midwives to make changes that will benefit childbearing women. They therefore stand in their own right as contributions to the thesis with their own discursive and epistemological intent. The reflexive process employed in this thesis highlights comparisons between what is being positioned as the potential of midwifery with what is also presented as the reality played out in contemporary Australian maternity service provision and in midwifery education and regulation. The thesis weaves its way around the portfolio documents, attempting to bring to life and discuss the culture in which rhetorical innovations and intentional strategies are aimed at narrowing the gap between 'rhetoric and reality'.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Social Aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/265</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Village Midwives and Cadres in Improving the Nutritional Status of Pregnant Women in Selected Rural Villages in Two Districts, Banten Province Indonesia 2003: A Longitudinal Descriptive Study</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study is a longitudinal descriptive study conducted in eight villages of Banten province, Indonesia. The research describes the nutritional status of two groups of pregnant village women and investigates the implementation and impact of an intervention to improve nutrition in pregnancy. The intervention aimed to improve the effectiveness of village midwives and cadres by improving the nutrition of pregnant women, particularly iron deficiency, through the use of a community development approach. The thesis identifies the importance of good nutrition during pregnancy and some of the factors, which influence it in the context of this study. It examines the health promotion programs for improving iron intake and nutrition in developing countries and specifically examines the programs that are used in Indonesia. A small decrease in the rate of anaemia appears to have occurred due to these programs, but the anaemia rate remains high. There has been little systematic examination of the cultural and social factors that may influence nutrition in pregnant women in Indonesia and few studies, which have measured the nutritional status of pregnant women. The goals of the study are to: *	Describe the social and cultural factors that influence nutrition, under nutrition and iron deficiency anaemia during pregnancy and to measure the nutritional status of rural women in Banten Province, Indonesia.  *	Improve the knowledge and skills of village midwives and cadres in using community development and effective communication to improve iron supplementation and nutrition. The conceptual framework for the study was derived from principles of health promotion, in particular the 'Proceed and Proceed' model (Green &amp; Kreuter 1991).  The study took place in eight villages in Banten province, Indonesia. Four of the villages received a community development intervention and four villages were used for comparison.  The study was undertaken in three stages: Stage 1 - Baseline Quantitative and Qualitative Data Collection; Stage 2 - Intervention; and Stage 3 - Follow Up Evaluation. The intervention was guided by the results of Stage 1 and consisted of a two-day workshop aimed to improve their knowledge, communication skills of the midwives and cadres and their ability to use a community development approach to improving nutrition in the villages. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used in the research at Stage 1 and Stage 3. Ethnographic methods of interview, observation, field notes and survey were used to collect information about the cultural and social factors that influence nutrition and nutritional practices during pregnancy. The knowledge and practices of midwives and cadres were also explored. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.  Forty pregnant women (20 from the intervention villages and 20 from the comparison villages) participated in the qualitative component of the research before the intervention (Stage 1). The follow up evaluation occurred 12 months later, and a different group of 35 pregnant women (20 from the intervention villages and 15 from the comparison villages) participated in the qualitative component of the research at Stage 3. The same eight midwives and 16 cadres participated in the qualitative research at Stage 1 and Stage 3. Quantitative data collected at Stage 1 and Stage 3 included socio demographic data, obstetric information and nutritional data (haemoglobin level, body mass index, and the weight gain of pregnant women).  Data was collected from 210 women before the intervention and 189 women after the intervention. Some changes in the practices of midwives and cadres were apparent after the intervention with midwives building better rapport, communicating more effectively and providing more information and support to pregnant women. Cadres also talked more about nutrition in community meetings. Changes in the behaviour and approach of village midwives and cadres' in relation to nutrition education resulted in improved nutritional behaviour of pregnant women to some extent, but poverty and culture restricted the ability of pregnant women to access better food. The intervention did not effect the overall nutritional status of the pregnant women. Because of time and logistical constraints, the intervention was not able to influence the community's health in the medium term in the intervention villages. The results of this study showed that the comparison villages sometimes had better results than the intervention villages.  A possible explanation is that the systematic evaluation of nutritional status may have increased the awareness and practice of the better-educated and more knowledgeable midwives who were located in the comparison villages. The comparison midwives had a better basic education in midwifery when compared to the intervention midwives. It appeared these better-educated workers responded positively to the research even without exposure to the intervention. The study showed that the position of the pregnant woman is low within the hierarchy of both the health care system and the power structures of the broader community. Husbands, mother-in-law, village midwives, cadres and village leaders all have more power to determine what pregnant women can and cannot eat and drink than women do themselves. However, some women tried to access better food after the intervention by subverting culture and the authority of husbands and mother-in-law and eating nutritious food in secret.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Java</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Application of Anti-dumping and Countervailing Measures in Australia</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The application of anti-dumping and countervailing measures has always been controversial, particularly, as they do not address the issue of the level of local value added in the production process.  Are these measures simply industry assistance measures under another guise, or are they to protect the 'fair trade' framework to further the opportunity for free trade?  All the indications are that these measures reflect the former option.  However, the global political climate as represented through the GATT and now the WTO Agreements is to tolerate the imposition of both anti-dumping and countervailing measures provided they are applied according to the provisions of the Agreements.  It is becoming increasingly more difficult for any nation state to abolish the right of their 'guest' industries to obtain anti-dumping or countervailing relief, given the economic power of multinational industries operating within their boundaries.  The practical issue is for each nation state to use these measures in a way which is of least detriment to their economy.  Gruen in 1986 reviewed the application of the then Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975, and found that there needed to be a tightening-up of the injury test applied to anti-dumping cases.  It is recommended that Gruen's tougher injury standards be implemented forthwith.  He also recommended a continuing role for the Industry Commission as the appeal body for a review of the facts, and for there to be a continuing assessment of the effects of the measures imposed.  The government, however, created an Anti-Dumping Authority attached to the then Department of Industry Technology and Commerce (DITAC), whose member and officers came from that department.  The principal function of this body was to review the preliminary decisions of Customs, and to recommend the imposition of duties or acceptance of an undertaking to the Minister.  There was no provision for an independent review of facts.  One of the results of the increased complexity of the existing process and consequently the law, is a large increase in litigation before the Federal Court.  There is a need to simplify the administrative structure and the provisions of the domestic law.  The latter should be accomplished by the incorporation of the provisions of the WTO Agreements directly into domestic law.  The espoused policy objectives of the government have not been met.  The application of anti-dumping and countervailing measures favour import competing industries, and are against countries from which imports are growing.  Korea and China have been singled out, with these countries showing the highest incidence of import weighted of anti-dumping measures.  They also happen to be countries with which Australia has a trade surplus, a policy factor which is neglected by the administering authorities.  There is a need to redress this imbalance.  Predation identified by the government as a reason for taking anti-dumping action, has been shown not to be a reason for the application of anti-dumping duties in Australia.  As a small country, Australia should take advantage of the use of the WTO dispute settlement process in settling anti-dumping and countervailing disputes.  Consultations should commence at the earliest possible stage in inquiries, with the view to the settlement of the dispute by trade negotiation so that the outcome can be beneficial to both parties.  This may, for example, allow for the specialisation in production between the two Members.  WTO dispute settlement is seen as a positive approach to dispute settlement, whereas the use of the domestic courts tends to elevate the dispute between the parties.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade needs to take a leadership role in settling all anti-dumping and countervailing actions through the WTO dispute settlement process, with a view to a positive outcome for both Members.  Placing an anti-dumping import tax on intermediate products entering Australia is counter-productive, as it increases the cost of inputs to downstream users.  Temporary relief should be given by way of production subsidy, if the matter cannot be resolved through WTO trade consultations.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dumping (International trade) -- Law and legislation -- Australia.

The interest in Knowledge Management is understandable given the moves towards knowledge based economies and workplaces.  Large organisations have begun to understand the value of the knowledge held within their organisation. Nowadays, the value of an organisation may be based on its intellectual capital and this is demonstrated by organisations being sold for many times its worth in terms of hard assets. The concept of being able to store and use the 'knowledge' that is generated inside an organisation has obvious appeal. However, the management of this 'knowledge' and the ability to use it for an advantage requires careful planning and an understanding of knowledge inside the organisation and its workers. This process requires a mix of organisational, cultural and technology understanding.  Current research and vendor interest is focussing on large organisations. However, Small to Medium size Enterprises (SMEs) also have an explicit need to manage their intellectual capital. Research interest in large organisations is strong, but SMEs cannot always use the findings that are targeted to large organisations and will probably be unable to afford the specific Knowledge Management tools offered by vendors.  Nevertheless, SMEs can use the knowledge in their organisations to gain an advantage. In particular, the tourism industry has a significant knowledge component and Knowledge Management could provide substantial benefits. Many Knowledge Management principles apply to organisations irrespective of their size. How these can be implemented within a SME is the subject of this thesis.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge management.</field><field name="subject">Small business management.</field><field name="subject">Tourism.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Construction of a Recombinant Immunotoxin</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">In recent years a number of therapeutically useful immunotoxins have been produced using recombinant gene technology. In general, this involves fusion of a toxin gene with sequence encoding a variety of clinically relevant proteins or peptides. Using these techniques a recombinant immunotoxin has been engineered by fusing the genes encoding an antibody fragment with the sequence of a small cytolytic peptide, melittin. The antibody fragment consists of the antigen binding site derived from a murine monoclonal antibody K- 1-21, which binds to human free kappa light chains and recognises a specific epitope (KMA) expressed on the surface of human myeloma and lymphoma cells. The toxic portion of the molecule is melittin, a 26 amino acid, membrane lytic peptide which is a major component of bee venom. Using PCR a single chain Fv (scFv) was constructed by linking VH and VL genes with an oligonucleotide encoding a flexible, hydrophilic peptide. The melittin gene was synthesised as an oligonucleotide and extended by PCR. Nucleotide sequence encoding a linker peptide was added to the 5' end and a primer encoding a FLAG peptide was used to extend the 3' end. This gene construct was then ligated into the recombinant expression vector, pPOW scFv, to create the fusion gene encoding the recombinant immunotoxin. The gene construct was expressed in the periplasm of E.coli (TOPP2) using the secretion signal pelB . Expression of the foreign protein was monitored by western blot using a monoclonal antibody which recognises the FLAG peptide encoded at the carboxy terminal region of the gene construct. Expression of the recombinant immunotoxin was optimised and the resulting protein was purified using anti-FLAG M2 affinity chromatography. Antigen binding activity was assessed by ELISA and flow cytometry using a human myeloma cell line, HMy2, which expresses the KMA antigen.Binding of the immunotoxin to a control human cell line, K562, which does not express KMA on the cell surface was also assessed. The results indicated that the recombinant immunotoxin retained antigen binding specificity and it was cytotoxic towards the target cell line (HMy2).</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antibody-toxin conjugates</field><field name="subject">antibody-toxin conjugates -- theraputic use</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resource Discovery and Fair Intelligent Admission Control over Scalable Internet</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The Internet currently supports a best-effort connectivity service. There has been an increasing demand for the Internet to support Quality of Service (QoS) to satisfy stringent service requirements from many emerging networking applications and yet to utilize the network resources efficiently. However, it has been found that even with augmented QoS architecture, the Internet cannot achieve the desired QoS and furthermore, there are concerns about the scalability of any available QoS solutions. If the network is not provisioned adequately, the Internet is not capable to handle congestion condition. This is because the Internet is unaware of its internal network QoS states therefore it is not possible to provide QoS when the network state changes dynamically.  This thesis addresses the following question: Is it possible to deliver the applications with QoS in the Internet fairly and efficiently while keeping scalability?  In this dissertation we answer this question affirmatively by proposing an innovative service architecture: the Resource Discovery (RD) and Fair Intelligent Admission Control (FIAC) over scalable Internet. The main contributions of this dissertation are as follows: 1. To detect the network QoS state, we propose the Resource Discovery (RD) framework to provide network QoS state dynamically. The Resource Discovery (RD) adopts feedback loop mechanism to collect the network QoS state and reports to the Fair Intelligent Admission Control module, so that FIAC is capable to take resource control efficiently and fairly. 2. To facilitate network resource management and flow admission control, two scalable Fair Intelligent Admission Control architectures are designed and analyzed on two levels: per-class level and per-flow level. Per-class FIAC handles the aggregate admission control for certain pre-defined aggregate. Per-flow FIAC handles the flow admission control in terms of fairness within the class. 3. To further improve its scalability, the Edge-Aware Resource Discovery and Fair Intelligent Admission Control is proposed which does not need the core routers involvement.  We devise and analyze implementation of the proposed solutions and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. For the Resource Discovery, two closed-loop feedback solutions are designed and investigated. The first one is a core-aware solution which is based on the direct QoS state information. To further improve its scalability, the edge-aware solution is designed where only the edges (not core)are involved in the feedback QoS state estimation. For admission control, FIAC module bridges the gap between 'external' traffic requirements and the 'internal' network ability. By utilizing the QoS state information from RD, FIAC intelligently allocate resources via per-class admission control and per-flow fairness control.  We study the performance and robustness of RD-FIAC through extensive simulations. Our results show that RD can obtain the internal network QoS state and FIAC can adjust resource allocation efficiently and fairly.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Information retrieval</field><field name="subject">Computer networks</field><field name="subject">Scalability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/271</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evidence, judicial notice and party comment: principles for ascertaining facts which predicate constitutional validity</field><field name="creator">Rochow, Neville Grant.</field><field name="description">Typescript (photocopy) Bibliography: leaves vii-xiv.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">NU</field><field name="subject">Procedure (Law) Australia</field><field name="subject">Evidence (Law) Australia</field><field name="subject">Justice, Administration of Australia</field><field name="subject">Trials</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09LM/09lmr781.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:5933187</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mentoring, women and the construction of academic identities</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">In this thesis I investigate the influence of mentoring on the formation of the identities of women academics in Australian universities. Many Australian and New Zealand universities have introduced some form of mentoring initiative for women academics over the last decade. The aim of these initiatives is usually expressed in terms of supporting women's career development in order to increase the representation of women in senior positions in universities. I take up Foucault's theory of governmentality together with feminist theories of subjectivity, to examine the ways in which mentoring contributes to 'producing' the women as academic subjects of the times. My analysis of the formation of the subjectivities of the women concerned is set in the context of a political economy of contemporary higher education accompanied by the changing nature of academic work. I argue that mentoring has found support in recent years because it responds to the concerns of 'the enterprise university' with improving performance while also being seen to respond to the problem of gender inequality. The thesis is based on interviews conducted with 17 women academics who have participated in a formal mentoring program or who have been mentored informally by a colleague in their universities, six of which are discussed in detail. I use a feminist interpretive framework to analyse the discourses through which the women and I construct their accounts at interview. I also highlight the parallels between the confessional aspects of feminist research interviewing and the confessional space of the mentoring relationship itself, particularly mentoring of women by women. On the basis of this analysis, I argue that mentoring has a number of productive effects, producing particular sorts of self-regulating subjects, together with new knowledges and discourses of work and of the self. In their engagement in mentoring, the women take up a project of self-review and self-regulation. This can be understood as a biographical project of the self. It is a project that is iterative and ongoing, as the women navigate the discourses of academic work, career, gender, mothering, sexuality, social class and ethnicity, amongst others. This process is frequently fragmented and contested as the women confront the contradictions within the combined positioning of themselves and their positioning by others. Rather than try to resolve the tensions and contradictions that characterise this process, these tensions might be better explored in terms of their productive potential for disrupting the gendered work order of universities.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">academia</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making meaning through History: scaffolding students' conceptual understanding through dialogue</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study aims to articulate a theory of teaching that accounts for both the cognitive development of the learner and the social context in which learning occurs. It contributes to discussions about a socially constructed theory of pedagogy that can inform classroom practice. It explores firstly the role of the teacher in supporting students' conceptual understanding and secondly the importance of dialogue as a means of apprenticing students into the discourse of a subject discipline. The sociocultural notion of 'scaffolding' and the way in which various 'scaffolding' strategies support students' learning are examined through the classroom data. This thesis also explores the classroom as a site of activity in which educational practice is enacted. The significance of language as a 'tool' for learning is central to this study, as is the notion of learning as a social process. Language is a mediating tool that enables a dialogic engagement that supports the development of thinking that is consistent with the goals of the teacher. Also investigated is the use of various semiotic modalities, in addition to language, to support the active co-construction of knowledge. The research is conducted in a Year 7 History class (the first year of high school) in an independent, secondary boys' high school using a case study approach. It uses observation in naturalistic settings, interviews and written documentation. A significant outcome of this research has been the identification of discourse strategies and other semiotic systems such as visual, gestural and actional cues, and examination of the ways in which they function in the discourse to support student learning in the local and immediate context. The importance of all aspects that constitute the context in which the students are learning is also affirmed in this study. Context is not merely a 'backdrop' or background to language, it is integral to the creation of meaning and field knowledge. Another major conclusion that can be drawn from this research is the distinction between scaffolding at a macro level, consisting of a planned, 'designed-in' approach to a unit of work in a subject discipline and the lessons that constitute it, and contingent scaffolding that operates at a micro level or 'at the point of need'. By applying a variety of linguistic tools drawing on Systemic Functional Linguistic theory, it has been possible to articulate the kinds of discourse and multimodal strategies that constitute the nature of scaffolding. A further finding in this research is the value of using detailed analysis of the data with different analytical tools to identify emerging patterns in the discourse and also to 'view' the same data through different 'lenses'. An additional finding is the significance of an Induction genre that provides foundational understandings about the study of History for apprentice historians. This is supported by two post-foundational lessons that form a Macrogenre. This macrogenre reinforces the application of focus questions that are fundamental to historical study and an approach to answering these questions that is consistent with the methodology of the subject. Another finding relates to the role the teacher adopts in the classroom. The classroom in this research is strongly teacher guided in terms of the development of content and ways of controlling the development of discourse. This research shows that this does not preclude the classroom from being dialogic. Even though there is a knowledge and status differential between the teacher as expert and the student as novice, the teacher provides opportunities for discussion and development of ideas about the topic. Finally, this study confirms the value of drawing on a broad range of theories to inform the research. These multiple perspectives draw from sociocultural approaches to a socially oriented theory of learning; Activity Theory, and the notion of language as a social semiotic. This range of perspectives allows for 'rich' descriptions from which to draw conclusions about effective teaching and learning practices.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication in teaching</field><field name="subject">Observation ( Educational method)</field><field name="subject">Educational Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Algorithms in the Study of Multiperfect and Odd Perfect Numbers</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">A long standing unanswered question in number theory concerns the existence (or not) of odd perfect numbers. Over time many properties of an odd perfect number have been established and refined. The initial goal of this research was to improve the lower bound on the number of distinct prime factors of an odd perfect number, if one exists, to at least 9. Previous approaches to this problem involved the analysis of a carefully chosen set of special cases with each then being eliminated by a contradiction. This thesis applies an algorithmic, factor chain approach to the problem. The implementation of such an approach as a computer program allows the speed, accuracy and flexibility of modern computer technology to not only assist but even direct the discovery process. In addition to considering odd perfect numbers, several related problems were investigated, concerned with (i) harmonic, (ii) even multiperfect and (iii) odd triperfect numbers. The aim in these cases was to demonstrate the correctness and versatility of the computer code and to fine tune its efficiency while seeking improved properties of these types of numbers. As a result of this work, significant improvements have been made to the understanding of harmonic numbers. The introduction of harmonic seeds, coupled with a straightforward procedure for generating most harmonic numbers below a chosen bound, expands the opportunities for further investigations of harmonic numbers and in particular allowed the determination of all harmonic numbers below 10 to the power 12 and a proof that there are no odd harmonic numbers below 10 to the power 15. When considering even multiperfect numbers, a search procedure was implemented to find the first 10-perfect number as well as several other new ones. As a fresh alternative to the factor chain search, a 0-1 linear programming model was constructed and used to show that all multiperfect numbers divisible by 2 to the power of a,  for a being less than or equal to 65, subject to a modest constraint, are known in the literature. Odd triperfect numbers (if they exist) have properties which are similar to, but simpler than, those for odd perfect numbers. An extended test on the possible prime factors of such a number was developed that, with minor differences, applies to both odd triperfect and odd perfect numbers. When applicable, this test allows an earlier determination of a contradiction within a factor chain and so reduces the effort required. It was also shown that an odd triperfect number must be greater than 10 to the power 128. While the goal of proving that an odd perfect number must have at least 9 distinct prime factors was not achieved, due to mainly practical limitations, the algorithmic approach was able to show that for an odd perfect number with 8 distinct prime factors, (i) if it is exactly divisible by 3 to the power of 2a then a = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 or a is greater than or equal to 31 (ii) if the special component is pi to the power of alpha, pi less than 10 to the 6 and pi to the (alpha+1) less than 10 to the 40, then alpha = 1.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Perfect numbers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Battered Body : A Feminist Legal History</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis investigates a current debate within feminist theory, and specifically within feminist legal theory, about how to challenge the liberal construction of women's subjectivity. It contends that positioning women as either equal to or different from the universalised liberal subject (based on male experience) fails to recognise women's experience as diverse, and differentiated. This thesis explores this issue through the empirical area of the treatment in the public sphere (constituted by the state and the law) of domestic violence, and of domestic violence survivors who kill their abusive spouses. It argues that the current feminist jurisprudential responses to the battered woman who kills, articulated through criticisms of the Battered Woman Syndrome, identify the need to challenge the binary oppositional framework in which these cases are decided and discussed by liberal legalism. However, it suggests that these responses do not ground their discussion in the historical preconditions which gave rise to the debate and the feminist framework in which that debate is conducted. This thesis argues that an historical re-examination of the ways in which women's experience of domestic violence, as well as the law's reading of it, was constructed is an important contribution to feminist legal theory. It undertakes this historical re-examination by situating the Battered Woman Syndrome and domestic violence within the struggles and campaigns of feminism in the past, especially feminism as it developed through the Women's Liberation Movement of the 1970s. It argues that the understanding of women and women's experience as diversely constituted through this period is essential for an understanding of current debates. This thesis represents an interdisciplinary feminist legal history. It uses both the method and evidence of history to challenge the legal understandings of battered women who kill. It posits that an interdisciplinary engagement between postmodern legal and historical theories, which contest objective assessments of subjects' experience, allows for a more complex and comprehensive assessment of how to approach, and critique, the Battered Woman Syndrome. It suggests that this can be accomplished by applying the techniques of narrative developed in historical theory to feminist legal theory. It therefore posits that a postmodern methodological approach, realised through a genealogical investigation of the subjectivity of battered women, is of value in the current debate about how to deal with the paradox presented by feminism's engagement with liberalism, and evidenced through the law's assessment of the battered woman who kills.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Feminist theory</field><field name="subject">Feminist jurisprudence</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information Utilisation: a Cognitive Analysis of How Girls Utilise Drug Information Based on Brookes' Fundamental Equation K[S] + &#8710;I = K[S + &#8710;S]</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The central focus of this study is cognitive information utilisation. Research in information utilisation to date has largely focused on the organisational outcomes of the take up of scientific and professional information in the context of social practice, and the related political, cultural and economic factors affecting this.	Conceptualising information utilisation as a type of organisational change or end-state has tended to mask the complex cognitive exchanges that occur. While there has been increasing acknowledgement that information utilisation is a more holistic interactive change process involving cognitive strategies and transformations, very little research has focused on the cognitive dimension of information utilisation. Bertram Brookes claimed that the theoretical pursuit of information science should be the cognitive interaction between people and information. He explicated this as the Fundamental Equation of information science, most commonly expressed in his writings as K[S] + &#8710;I = K[S + &#8710;S]. By this equation, Brookes was stating that in the process of doing something with information, a person's existing knowledge structure K[S] is changed by an increment of information &#8710;I, and this modification has some effect, a changed knowledge structure K[S + &#8710;S] where &#8710;S indicates the effect of the modification. This equation is posited as an expression of cognitive information utilisation. The specific purpose of this study is to further understanding of cognitive information utilisation, employing Brookes' Fundamental Equation as a general framework for establishing research questions, operational rationalisations and procedures. With a group of four girls in their final year of secondary education, the study sought to: (a) establish the effects &#8710;S of exposure to information perceived by the girls; (b) establish how the perceived effects are associated with changes to their knowledge structures K[S]; and (c) establish the patterns, if any, within and between the girls in relation to changes in knowledge structures and perceived effects (K[S + &#8710;S]). The study employed a quasi-experimental repeated phase approach. The girls' existing knowledge structures about the drug heroin were mapped, and knowledge structures after each of three exposures to different information on heroin were also mapped. Eliciting the girls' knowledge about heroin was based on written discourse and question / answer protocols, and this knowledge was represented as conceptual graph structures, based on an analytical procedure developed by Graesser &amp; Clark (1985). The data were analysed qualitatively to establish indicators and conceptualisations of the perceived effects, and to identify and conceptualise the changed knowledge structures. The study found that the exposures to information and the deliberate consideration of this information had effects for all the girls. Five types of effects were perceived, these being: get a complete picture, get a changed picture, get a clearer picture, get a verified picture, and get a position in a picture. These effects are presented as types of cognitive information utilisation. The knowledge structures after each exposure were shown to change by cognitive strategies of appending, inserting and deleting. The analysis of the knowledge structures associated with these five effects showed that there was coherence between the effects and how these effects were manifested in changes to the girls' knowledge structures. A number of distinct patterns were evident, for example, get a complete picture was associated with revised knowledge structures that were more inclusive, elaborative and integrative. The study raises important implications for information practice, including data base design, information interviews, provision of information in media campaigns, and instructional design. The study also addresses methodological issues and identifies area for further research.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human information processing</field><field name="subject">Cognitive psychology</field><field name="subject">Reasoning</field><field name="subject">Drug abuse</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Dimensions in Water Conservation; An Inter-animation of Writing and Water</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Water is a finite resource which is increasingly valued as a commodity.  This thesis explores the use and appreciation of water, in the context of community response and exchange.  Its focus is a community writing practice, and in particular a project entitled new dimensions in Water Conversation based in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales.  This project was a non-crisis driven investigation into a wide range of interests in water.  The central proposition of the thesis is that techno-scientific and broader cultural world views on water rarely connect, and that bringing them together reveals awkward tensions between specialist and non-specialist standpoints.  These disparities are shown in the group writings and outcome of the project, which bring water provision into closer perspective.  A story emerges from the project and its influences.  It is one of material relationships to water over testings, tastings and visits to a water treatment works.  It suggests links which would not normally be anticipated, for example between a regional bulk water supplier and a group of water writers.  The study combines fiction and contemplation with critical analysis and the thesis crosses disciplinary boundaries, drawing on insights from critical cultural theory and the philosophy of science.  The writing is performative rather than accumulative in nature, yet is a concrete record of the interplay between water users and water specialists, in a local and global dimension which includes the Northern Rivers, Australia more generally and Varanasi in India.  Using this transcultural approach, it decentres theory and locates value in the situated contexts and views of different stakeholders in water, which range from sacred values to indifference.  The work calls out for a way of thinking about water that is not yet in the public discourse.  Through the practical connection of the project with an Australian water instrumentality, it draws in developments in contemporary water management, and raises questions and doubts about how instrumentalist and market values have come to dominate imaginings of a global water future.  At the same time it points to the importance of putting the values of the arts and humanities into practice in the increasingly inter-disciplinary environment in which the resource of water is managed and maintained.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">water</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">northern rivers</field><field name="subject">community writing</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">cross-culture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spiral Architecture for Machine Vision</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis presents a new and powerful approach to the development of a general purpose machine vision system. The approach is inspired from anatomical considerations of the primate's vision system. The geometrical arrangement of cones on a primate's retina can be described in terms of a hexagonal grid. The importance of the hexagonal grid is that it possesses special computational features that are pertinent to the vision process. The fundamental thrust of this thesis emanates from the observation that this hexagonal grid can be described in terms of the mathematical object known as a Euclidean ring. The Euclidean ring is employed to generate an algebra of linear transformations which are appropriate for the processing of multidimensional vision data. A parallel autonomous segmentation algorithm for multidimensional vision data is described. The algebra and segmentation algorithm are implemented on a network of transputers.

Yet, in general, the construction industry continues to degrade the environment, exploiting resources and generating waste, and is reluctant to change its conventional practices to incorporate environmental matters as part of the decisionmaking process. Building development involves complex decisions and the increased significance of external effects has further complicated the situation. Cost benefit analysis (CBA) is one of the conventional tools used widely by public and private sectors when appraising projects. It sets out to measure and compare the total costs and benefits of different projects that are competing for scarce resources in monetary terms. However, there are growing concerns that the values of environmental goods and services are often ignored or underestimated in the CBA approach which has led to the overuse and depletion of environmental assets. Consequently, CBA's usefulness and relevance in this respect is increasingly controversial. Project development is not just concerned with financial return, but is also conscious of the long-term impacts on living standards for both present and future generations.  Sustainable development is an important issue in project decision-making and environmental effects need to be incorporated into the evaluation process. A multi- dimensional evaluation approach attracts increasing attention around the world as the way to incorporate environmental issues in the decision-making process. This approach uses the conventional market approach to monetarise economic aspects of a development, whilst using a non-monetary approach to evaluate the environmental matters. The purpose of this thesis is to critically examine the impact of construction activities on the environment and methods of quantifying environmental matters. This thesis also evaluates the principal sustainable development determinants for modelling, and evaluating long-term environmental performance of buildings during the project appraisal stage. Projects can be assessed using an index system that combines the principal determinants of sustainable development. The four criteria as identified in this research are financial return, energy consumption, external benefits and environmental impact. The derived sustainability index combines the four identified attributes into a single decision-making tool. The attributes are each expressed in units that are best suited to their quantitative assessment. The development of a sustainability index is a way of combining economic and environmental criteria into the decision-making framework. The sustainability index has also been developed into computer software called SINDEX to be used as a benchmarking tool to aid design and the sustainability assessment of projects. SINDEX is a sustainability modelling tool used to calculate and benchmark sustainable performance of proposed buildings, new and existing facilities.  Conventional project appraisal techniques measure net social gain to select a project, whilst the sustainability index measures the relative ranking of projects from a sustainable development view. Buildings have a long life, so any improvement in appraisal techniques for choosing the best option amongst the alternatives will significantly reduce their future environmental impact. As such, a methodology that embraces various criteria in relation to project development is crucial in this respect.  The development of a sustainability index is a way to combine multiple criteria measured using different units. Using the sustainability index will greatly assist the construction industry to realise sustainable development goals, and thereby make a positive contribution to identifying optimum design solutions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Construction industry</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Sport Development Processes in Australia</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with Australian sport policy, specifically sport development in Australia. Therefore, its theoretical origins lie within the discourse of public policy.  While public policy studies are abundant, sport policy research and in particular sport development studies are limited. Hence there is a shortage in the literature on sport development research. Sport nevertheless established itself as a legitimate policy area in Australia in the mid-1970s. Since then, the Federal Government's involvement with sport policy has expanded and nowadays sport in Australia is very much impacted by Federal Government support. However, increased interest and importance placed on sport have not induced corresponding attention from sport policy studies. This study is a first effort to portray the sport development processes as it occurs in the Australian context. In particular, this thesis examines the impact of the Federal Government involvement with sport policy on the sport development processes at a national level. In doing so, this study explores the roles of the key sport development players and the ways sport policies shape sport development processes. Additionally, the study explores the available sport development pathways and the relationships between sport policy players, policies and sport development processes. There have been previous efforts to depict the processes involved with sport development by means of a pyramid that incorporates mass participants at its base and the elite athletes at its peak. This framework provides a very simplistic representation of sport development and does not explicate the embedded processes (Eady, 1993, Shilbury &amp; Deane, 2001). The aforementioned inadequacy of the existing framework to explain sport development led to grounded theory research. Grounded theory is a qualitative research approach formulated by Glaser and Strauss (1967) as a means of generating theory, when existing theoretical frameworks are inadequate to explain a phenomenon, which is embedded in systematically gathered and analysed data (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967; Bryman, 1988). Strauss and Corbin (1994) argued that if the research question concerns a process, the method of choice for addressing the question is grounded theory. This method led to the constant comparison and coding of data from the Annual Reports of 35 National Sporting Organisations in Australia. These documents covered the years from 1999-2002 (inclusive) and are linked to a Federal Government funding cycle.  Grounded theory research is viewed as 'the foundation for subsequent deductive studies that test out the resulting theory or interventions based on it' (Oshansky, 1996, p. 394). Hence, the model this thesis offers is subject to further empirical testing and future research. The results of the study provide a theoretical framework to understand the Sport Development Processes in Australia. The Sport Development Processes framework illustrates that at the hub of successful sport development there are three major and interrelated requirements: a) Stakeholders, b) Practices and c) Pathways. Sport Development Stakeholders (i.e. governments, sporting organisations and significant others) provide the unity and teamwork necessary for the Sport Development Practices that in turn provide the required Sport Development Pathways. These pathways as the result of sport stakeholder involvement and policy implementation allow Sport Development Processes to occur. According to the Sport Development Processes framework there are three interrelated processes (i.e. Attraction, Retention/Transition, and Nurturing) which involve attracting, retaining and developing the most skilled athletes, building participation and using sport performance to positively influence community involvement with sport. For each process to be successful, a different combination of stakeholder involvement and practices (hence resulting pathways) is necessary. This model provides a unique contribution to the field of sport policy, as it is the first theoretical attempt to fill the void regarding sport development processes. In the process, sport development officers, policy makers and sporting organisations at all levels around Australia are provided with a comprehensive model that assists and advances understanding of sport development processes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sport</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">processes</field><field name="subject">federal</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/282</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What are the characteristics and driving forces behind the creativity and vision of successful Lebanese immigrants?</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Creative visualization is an essential attribute to be possessed by an artist to achieve success in any art endeavour. To reach its purpose in all its fields, art is made manifest and is expressed through real genuine passion. This research study acknowledges Gibran Kahlil Gibran, as a distinguished immigrant artist, with a vision. A comparison is then made of six other artists, including the researcher, who have all had similar ordeals in the successful attainment of their vision.  This biographical, neo-narrative research design methodology was recorded through extensive readings and lengthy interviews, which consisted of proposing specific questions to each of the participants in order to extract valid and comparable findings. As a consequence, the art researcher was able to observe, reflect and draw some relevant conclusions towards the creative vision of Lebanese immigrants, which led to their success despite hardships, expatriation, ambition and hope.  This study has provided the researcher with real insight into the characteristics of these artists and what constitutes a successful immigrant. It has confirmed her pre-conceived perceptions that success takes time and personal effort.  It highlights the importance for the existence of tolerance between people, which in turn will enable the realisation of empathy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creativity</field><field name="subject">creative ability</field><field name="subject">vision</field><field name="subject">interviews</field><field name="subject">immigrants</field><field name="subject">Lebanese</field><field name="subject">Kahlil Gibran</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/283</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Construction of the Meaning and Significance of an 'Author' among Information Behaviour Researchers. A Social Constructivist approach.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study identifies and explores the social processes that influence the construction by academic researchers of the meaning/s and significance/s of an author and her work prominent in the literature of their field. It examines the construction by 15 information behaviour researchers of Brenda Dervin and her work, using semi-structured interviewing and inductive analysis techniques.  In focussing theoretical attention on social processes, the study seeks to address critiques of prevailing approaches to information behaviour research, such as: a focus on individual cognition at the expense of social and affective factors; a construction of information users defined by their areas of ignorance and uncertainty, rather than their expertise; and a focus on purposive rather than non-purposive information behaviour.  Conceptually, the study has been influenced by a range of theoretical approaches from both information behaviour research and a variety of other disciplines, including Dervin's Sense-Making and Foucauldian discourse analysis.  The study found that participants' initial contact with the author and her work, and the subsequent important events in their relationship, occurred not because of purposeful searching, but rather 'socially' - as a part of non-purposive events and relationships related to the participants' role as academic researchers. The source most frequently discussed by participants was informal discussions with colleagues, and participants' interactions with 'author texts' were commonly mediated by their interpersonal communication. The study found that the significant influences on participants' constructive processes were people and texts with whom they had a long-term relationship.  Participants' constructions of the author and her work were an essentially social process. Their sense-making was inextricably linked to their social context/s: their interactions with their colleagues and mentors; their engagement with the literature and theories of information science and other fields; their research interests and specialisations; and their educational and cultural backgrounds. Participants' constructive processes largely involved elaborating existing constructions - radical changes in construction were both rare and traumatic. Participants' constructions were neither objective nor wholly subjective, but intersubjective - based on shared understandings, conventions and social practices.  Participants' constructive processes had two interdependent aspects: the construction of meaning and the construction of authority (knowledge/power). Participants' informal behaviour, as well as their engagement with formal information sources, involved constructions of authority. Their constructions of the authority of their informant/s determined whether they accepted or rejected the constructions of the author conveyed to them.

The presentation of the thesis comprises the Dissertation component (66%) along with the Practice Component and the Practice Report (33%). The Practice Report documents the nature and development of the research undertaken during the course of the study. The culmination of the Practice Component takes the form of an exhibition and archiving of video works from June 2003 to the date of submission, January 2005.  The Practice Component has been based in the following locations and used resources from Central Queensland University (Bundaberg campus), and The Australian National University, Centre for New Media Arts in Canberra. The practice has examined the topic through the production of the audio-video installation Sugartown and three video works The Hazzards, Nodal Dialectics 1 and boomsplatbangwhack. While these video works exist as discrete media artworks, they also operate as a type of practice process diary for working through the ideas explored in the written dissertation. Even though the video works are not meant to literally 'illustrate' those ideas, they nevertheless explore ways of integrating the theoretical concepts into my own research practice.

Accordingly a promise received in exchange is not enforceable. This is so whether the promise would have the effect of creating a new contract or modifying the terms of an existing contract. The rule has from time to time been the subject of judicial criticism but nevertheless operated with full vigor until 1991. Hitherto, (except in unilateral contract situations) consideration subsisted in the promises made by the parties at the instant of exchange rendering the promises thenceforth mutually enforceable. The contract or the modified contract effectively existed from that time, unconcerned with what the parties hoped to gain from the exchange or what each in fact gained. The English Court of Appeal decision in Williams v. Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls Ltd has the potential to change the law as settled. This dissertation is concerned with the consequences of the decision in the context of promises intended to modify the terms of existing contracts. In Williams v. Roffey the successful promisee gave the promisor no more than an understanding that he would continue to attempt to perform his undertaking under a prior contract. The Court held that the 'practical benefit' that accrued to the promisor from the repetition of the previous promise was sufficient consideration to make the promise of increased payment enforceable. The second promise was made outside the bargaining process and the potential for 'practical benefit' was neither solicited nor offered. The fact that there would be a 'practical benefit' was a deduction made by the Court as a result of questioning counsel for the defendant during the argument of the appeal. The dissertation examines the history of the doctrine of consideration, its incidents, which are said to enable consideration to moderate bargains, and how each is potentially rendered redundant by the decision. As a result of the decision, the role of the court has changed with greater emphasis on the substance of the transaction instead of external characteristics. The superior record keeping methods available to commerce in the 20th century facilitates this change. The following matters seem implicit in the decision. First, the bargaining process has lost its significance in contract modification situations. Second, the courts in determining what is practical and what is not, will find it difficult to avoid investigating the adequacy of consideration. This is an investigation that the courts have steadfastly refused to undertake in the past. The series of Australian authorities commencing with Je Maintendrai v. Quaglia and culminating in The Commonwealth of Australia v. Verwayen are examined. Whilst it is correct to say that those decisions, especially Waltons Stores v. Maher, introduce reliance based liability into the Australian law, the conclusion is reached that extensions to the law of estoppel do not solve the problems arising out of promises that modify existing contracts. This is because detriment to the promisee is necessary to trigger the operation of the law of estoppel and the remedy, being equitable, is discretionary. In contract modification situations the detriment suffered by the promisee is often ethereal and a discretionary remedy (as opposed to enforcing the promise) deprives the transaction of the certainty that is desirable in commercial transactions. The work concludes that, in regard to contract modifications, the doctrine of consideration ceases to perform a useful role and the equitable remedies do not meet the needs of commerce. Accordingly, the suggestion is made that all promises having the effect of modifying an existing contract should be enforceable provided that there is satisfactory evidence that the promise was made and the absence of duress.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">contracts</field><field name="subject">consideration (Law)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Inquiry Into PBNM System Performance Required For Massive Scale Telecommunication Applications</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">PBNM systems have been proposed as a feasible techology for managing massive scale applications including telecommunication service management. What is not known is how this class of system performs under carrier-scale traffic loads. This research investigates this open question and concludes, subject to the considerations herein, this technology can provide services to large scale applications. An in depth examination of several inferencing algorithms is made using experimental methods. The inferencing operation has been implicated as the major source of performance problems in rule based systems and we examine this. Moreover, these algorithms are of central importance to current and future context-aware, pervasive, mobile services. A novel algorithm, JukeBox, is proposed that is a correct, general and pure bindspace conjunctive match algorithm. It is compared to the current state of the art algorithm - Rete. We find that Rete is the superior algorithm when implemented using the hashed-equality variant. We also conclude that IO is an important cause of PBNM system performace limitations and is perhaps of more significance than the implicated inferencing operations. However, inferencing can be a bottleneck to performance and we document the factors associated with this. We describe a generally useful policy system benchmarking procedure that provides a visible, repeatable and measurable process for establishing a policy server's service rate characteristics. The service rate statistics, namely (mu) and (sigma), establish the limitations to policy system throughput. Combined with the offered traffic load to the server, using the statistic (lambda), we can provide a complete characterisation of system performance using the Pollaczek-Khinchine function. This characterisation allows us to make simple design and dimensioning heuristics that can be used to rate the policy system as a whole.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Based</field><field name="subject">Network</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of Joint Intensity Algorithms to the Registration of Emission Tomography and Anatomical Images</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">In current practice, it is common in medical diagnosis or treatment monitoring for a patient to require multiple examinations using different imaging techniques. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) are good at providing anatomical information. Three-dimensional functional information about tissues and organs is often obtained with radionuclide imaging modalities: positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission tomography (SPET). In nuclear medicine, such techniques must contend with poor spatial resolution, poor counting statistics of functional images and the lack of correspondence between the distribution of the radioactive tracer and anatomical boundaries. Information gained from anatomical and functional images is usually of a complementary nature. Since the patient cannot be relied on to assume exactly the same pose at different times and possibly in different scanners, spatial alignment of images is needed. In this thesis, a general framework for image registration is presented, in which the optimum alignment corresponds to a maximum of a similarity measure. Particular attention is drawn to entropy-based measures, and variance-based measures. These similarity measures include mutual information, normalized mutual information and correlation ratio which are the ones being considered in this study. In multimodality image registration between functional and anatomical images, these measures manifest superior performance compared to feature-based measures. A common characteristic of these measures is the use of the joint-intensity histogram, which is needed to estimate the joint probability and the marginal probability of the images. A novel similarity measure is proposed, the symmetric correlation ratio (SCR), which is a simple extension of the correlation ratio measure. Experiments were performed to study questions pertaining to the optimization of the registration process. For example, do these measures produce similar registration accuracy in the non-brain region as in the brain? Does the performance of SPET-CT registration depend on the choice of the reconstruction method (FBP or OSEM)? The joint-intensity based similarity measures were examined and compared using clinical data with real distortions and digital phantoms with synthetic distortions. In automatic SPET-MR rigid-body registration applied to clinical brain data, a global mean accuracy of 3.9 mm was measured using external fiducial markers. SCR performed better than mutual information when sparse sampling was used to speed up the registration process.  Using the Zubal phantom of the thoracic-abdominal region, SPET projections for Methylenediphosponate (MDP) and Gallium-67 (67Ga) studies were simulated for 360 degree data, accounting for noise, attenuation and depth-dependent resolution. Projection data were reconstructed using conventional filtered back projection (FBP) and accelerated maximum likelihood reconstruction based on the use of ordered subsets (OSEM). The results of SPET-CT rigid-body registration of the thoracic-abdominal region revealed that registration accuracy was insensitive to image noise, irrespective of which reconstruction method was used. The registration accuracy, to some extent, depended on which algorithm (OSEM or FBP) was used for SPET reconstruction. It was found that, for roughly noise-equivalent images, OSEM-reconstructed SPET produced better registration than FBP-reconstructed SPET when attenuation compensation (AC) was included but this was less obvious for SPET without AC. The results suggest that OSEM is the preferable SPET reconstruction algorithm, producing more accurate rigidbody image registration when AC is used to remove artifacts due to non-uniform attenuation in the thoracic region. Registration performance deteriorated with decreasing planar projection count. The presence of the body boundary in the SPET image and matching fields of view were shown not to affect the registration performance substantially but pre-processing steps such as CT intensity windowing did improve registration accuracy. Non-rigid registration based on SCR was also investigated. The proposed algorithm for non-rigid registration is based on overlapping image blocks defined on a 3D grid pattern and a multi-level strategy. The transformation vector field, representing image deformation is found by translating each block so as to maximize the local similarity measure. The resulting sparsely sampled vector field is interpolated using a Gaussian function to ensure a locally smooth transformation. Comparisons were performed to test the effectiveness of SCR, MI and NMI in 3D intra- and inter-modality registration. The accuracy of the technique was evaluated on digital phantoms and on patient data. SCR demonstrated a better non-rigid registration than MI when sparse sampling was used for image block matching. For the high-resolution MR-MR image of brain region, the proposed algorithm was successful, placing 92% of image voxels within less than or equal to 2 voxels of the true position. Where one of the images had low resolution (e.g. in CT-SPET, MR-SPET registration), the accuracy and robustness deteriorated profoundly. In the current implementation, a 3D registration process takes about 10 minutes to complete on a stand alone Pentium IV PC with 1.7 GHz CPU and 256 Mbytes random access memory on board.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear medicine</field><field name="subject">Image registration</field><field name="subject">Magnetic resonance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/288</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of project management mechanisms in software development and their relationship to organisational distance; An emperical investigation</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis describes empirical research into project management of software development.  Specifically, the aim of the research is to investigate how project managers monitor, control and coordinate software development tasks and how this is affected by changing environments, in this case increased organizational distance between the project manager and elements of the project team. Differing project environments allow investigation into which project management mechanisms are essential, which are required in specific circumstances and which may be useful but not necessarily essential.  To explore how software development projects are monitored, controlled and coordinated, a broad range of literature from software development and other fields such as organization theory, supply chain management and automobile manufacture is examined to establish a consensus of the mechanisms of project monitoring, control and coordination and their classification into groups. To better understand how the different mechanisms may be selected in different circumstances, a range of contingencies is examined to deduce which of these contingencies may significantly affect the project management of software development projects. Outsourced and distributed software development projects are becoming more frequent than in the past with consequent effects on project management practices. Although there has been some research into the ways in which project managers monitor, control and coordinate software development projects, little of it has investigated how the mechanisms employed to do so may be affected by such factors as increasing organizational distance. If more were known about the ways in which changed project environments affected the selection and use of project management mechanisms, better responses to those environmental changes could be devised.  This could also identify where tools could be developed to assist project management of outsourced and distributed projects. In this research, the term 'organizational distance' is used to describe the cultural, structural and administrative distance between the project manager and elements of the project team. Since there is limited information available on the concept of organizational distance, a new model is developed that encompasses the dimensions of distance that may be found in outsourced or globally distributed projects. A second model is then developed that relates changes in the factors of organizational distance with preferred choices of project management mechanism via project contingencies. Empirical data were collected by structured interviews with project managers who were currently engaged in software development within Sydney, Australia. The method of collecting the data provided both quantitative and qualitative data that enabled three separate ways to investigate the research questions.  The empirical research found that project managers do not rely on a single mechanism to monitor, control or coordinate a software development project but employ multiple mechanisms.  While the portfolio of mechanisms for both monitoring and control comprised a relatively narrow selection, the portfolio of coordination mechanisms was more diverse. Project monitoring mechanisms were employed to first detect any project problems then to respond to those problems. This contrasts with monitoring systems designed to provide all the information about both the existence and probable causes of project problems.  Project control mechanisms reflected the origin of the control. The constraints imposed on the project by the organization and used by the project manager to direct the project tended to be outcome related, for example budget and schedule. The behaviour of the project team, even across significant organizational distances, was controlled through the use of project plans that determined when different tasks would be performed.  Project coordination mechanisms reflected the different types of dependencies between software development activities. The most common was using a project work breakdown structure, expressed in the project schedule, to resolve sequential and pooled resource dependencies.  Mutual dependencies tended to be resolved using interactive mechanisms such as co-location, conversations and meetings. The empirical evidence did not find any difference between co-located projects and distributed projects so far as the choice of project management mechanisms were concerned. Distributed and globally outsourced software development projects may encounter many difficulties that a fully co-located project does not, but the response to those difficulties appears to lie with the implementation of project management mechanisms and not their selection.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Project</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Computer</field><field name="subject">Software</field><field name="subject">Development</field><field name="subject">Monitor</field><field name="subject">Control</field><field name="subject">Coordinate</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of Organisational Culture, Subculture, Leadership Style and Job Satisfaction on Organisational Commitment</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Despite the large number of studies that have examined the antecedents of organisational commitment, the investigation of the influence of organisational culture and subculture on commitment is noticeably absent. The aim of this thesis is to examine the effects of both organisational culture and subculture on organisational commitment. Other measures which have been shown to be related to either organisational commitment or organisational culture are also included in the study. These are leadership style, job satisfaction and demographic variables such as age, education, years in position and years of experience. Recently, multivariate studies have examined the causal relationships between a variety of different variables and organisational commitment, and a number of these have concluded that the effects of these variables on organisational commitment were mainly mediated by job satisfaction. The data gathered in the present study is examined to determine if it is consistent with job satisfaction fulfilling such a mediating role between commitment and the other variables in the study. Also, a multi-dimensional measure of job satisfaction is employed in the present study and the effects of the different job satisfaction components on commitment are investigated. The subjects used in this study were nurses working in different hospital settings. A questionnaire survey was used which was complemented by semistructured interviews. A total of 398 questionnaires were distributed to nurses in seven hospitals, from which 251 completed questionnaires were returned (63.5% response rate). The sample was obtained from three general public hospitals, two private hospitals and two psychiatric hospitals. Correlational and regression analyses were used to investigate the relationships between nurses' commitment to their wards and the other variables measured in the study. A causal model of commitment was developed using a multiple regression analysis in which the role of job satisfaction in mediating the causal link between commitment and the other variables was explored. It was found that organisational subculture had a greater impact on commitment than organisational culture. Innovative and supportive subcultures had a positive effect on commitment and a bureaucratic subculture had a negative effect on commitment. The leadership style variable, consideration, also exerted a relatively strong influence on commitment when compared with other variables included in the study. The results of this study also revealed that the job satisfaction dimensions with the strongest associations with commitment were the control, professionalism and interaction dimensions, which represent intrinsic factors of job satisfaction or those related to higherorder needs in Maslow's (1943) hierarchy. Age showed a direct positive influence on commitment. However, the level of education, years in position and years of clinical experience failed to showed any impact on commitment. Thus, the results of this study are not in agreement with causal models (such as that proposed by Williams and Hazer 1986), in which the influence of various antecedents on commitment are totally mediated via their influence on job satisfaction. The effect of the culture and leadership style variables on commitment was found to be significantly reduced, but not totally eliminated, after statistically controlling for the job satisfaction variables. Finally, in relation to the different hospital groups, the results showed that private hospitals had the strongest bureaucratic ward culture when compared to general public and psychiatric hospitals. The most innovative ward culture was found in general public hospitals and the most supportive ward culture was found in psychiatric hospitals. These findings were contrary to expected outcomes.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organizational behavior</field><field name="subject">Job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Corporate culture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impacts of Selective Outsourcing Of Information Technology And Information Services</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study identifies the impacts to the internal Information Technology (IT) department's policies and procedures caused by outsourcing selective IT functions and assesses the threats and opportunities to an internal IT group, presented by outsourcing selective IT functions.  The trend to selectively outsource IT functions implies that this can be done with minimal disruption and risk to the IT departments policies and processes. This research investigates whether this assertion is valid and develops a model for internal IT departments to respond to the challenges presented by selective outsourcing.  Existing models of outsourcing currently in use and available to organizations are reviewed to assess their suitability or adaptability for `selective outsourcing' and from this identifies which areas of internal IT policy and procedures are most impacted. An analysis of the threats and opportunities presented to the internal IT department is also provided.  Research was conducted into one organization's experience with selective outsourcing to investigate how internal IT departments could approach selective outsourcing of internal IT functions and how internal IT departments could develop strategies for responding to the challenges posed by selective outsourcing.  A case study was conducted of a recent selective outsourcing arrangement within the IT group of the target organization. The personal interview method was adopted to survey a cross section of management and staff from the work groups involved in the selective outsourcing arrangement.  The results obtained revolved around the major themes of: 1. Planning (identified as time constraints, resource constraints and work load).  2. Management control (which encompasses the structuring of the outsourcing relationship, human resource concerns, level of ownership, communication, structure of the internal IT group and inter-departmental concerns).  3. Process (which applies to the quality of the procedures, inherent internal knowledge required, the informality of the procedures and concerns over adherence to procedures).  For an IT group to develop strategies to respond to the challenges of selective outsourcing it was identified that the IT group needs to remove internal barriers to process and strive to achieve single ownership of processes within functional work groups; nurture a shift in internal groups thinking to more planning rather than doing; improve the quality of internal IT procedures and implement appropriate project team structures for task specific selective outsourcing engagements and for ongoing vendor relationship management.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electronic data processing departments</field><field name="subject">Contracting out</field><field name="subject">Information technology</field><field name="subject">Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Counting Maternity: The Measure of Midwifery in Australia, 2002.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The aim of this Professional Doctorate in Midwifery is to challenge the status quo in maternity services through scholarly reflection and research. Through the studies reported here I aim to provide women with information on which to make informed choices about the services available to them, and to ensure politicians become more responsive to the lack of options currently available in Australia. My aim is also to provide measures that would allow maternity service managers to deploy resources more efficiently to achieve the best care.  The majority of the papers in the portfolio are derived from population data that is routinely collected in Australia. One of the cornerstones of healthcare improvement is creating meaningful information and measurement from these collections. True comparisons from accurate data can be used to better understand the nature of the system, and to gauge whether changes have been effective. Thus, the information derived from various collections of routinely collected data is used to measure and evaluate the maternity services. This measures only part of the experience of childbirth, however.  The Doctorate is a collection of nine major works undertaken in the years 1999 to 2002, during my appointment as a research midwife with the Australian Midwifery Action Project (AMAP). The first paper is an essay that tells of the juxtaposition of two different worldviews and the paradigmatic issues that shape the professional differences between obstetrics and midwifery. The second consists of a brief overview of the Australian maternity system described within the terms of reference for a Senate Inquiry into Childbirth Procedures. The third and fourth papers explore the levels of obstetric intervention for low risk women and the cost of these interventions using a new costing model derived from population data. The fifth paper reviews the contemporary issues in the workforce and education of midwives. The sixth paper outlines a proposal for funding reform and a new model of midwifery care. The seventh paper compares midwifery in Australia and New Zealand, in terms of a public health strategy. The eighth paper explores the concept of a new research method called Graffiti; and the final paper continues the theme of measurement in an essay titled 'Evidence based Everything.  The portfolio explores a number of issues around public funding and the call for reform of the maternity services in Australia. In particular it argues for reforms to fund a more responsive service, based on values outlined by women who experience maternity care in Australia, as opposed to those guided by obstetrics and technology who currently set the agenda and determine the way maternity services will be offered and funded.  Although I have articulated and measured some of the characteristics of midwifery and obstetric care in Australia, this disentangling or quantification merely underlies and emphasises the many more continuations and complexities that coexist beyond that, which is 'measured'.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Project Pluralism: combining the hard and soft paradigms in IS/IT strategy development in the NSW public sector</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This research examines pluralist practice, the combination of methodologies based in different paradigms. Two paradigms are discussed throughout this research, referred to as the hard and soft paradigms. The hard paradigm is commonly associated with positivism and quantitative data, while the soft paradigm is commonly associated with interpretivism and qualitative data. These two paradigms present considerably different perspectives on the world, and methodologies based on these paradigms tend to place different emphases on research and practice. The combination of methodologies from different paradigms presents a number of problems for practice. These include the problem of paradigmatic incommensurability and issues related to practitioner skill diversity, and difficulties in reconciling the different perspectives that are brought to a situation by different methodologies. This research explores pluralist practice through the combination of Project Management and Soft Systems Methodology, methodologies which are based on the hard and soft paradigms respectively. The combination of these methodologies is informed by aspects of the Critical Systems Thinking literature, and based on the Embedding model for pluralism. The combination of these methodologies is explored in the context of an IS / IT strategy development project, in the NSW public sector. This project was set within an environment typified by changing stakeholder relationships, abstractly defined and changing goals, and a variety of external influences which altered throughout the course of the project. A combination of Project Management and Soft Systems Methodology, based on the Embedding model for pluralism, was used in the management of this project, and resulted in a project which is demonstrated to have provided lasting benefit to the organisation. This is participative, practice based research, and Action Research has been used as the research methodology for this thesis. Action Research has been chosen as a way of linking theory and practice, allowing for the simultaneous development of theory and practice, through cycles of active reflection. The interpretation of research findings has been informed by hermeneutic philosophies. Learning outcomes resulting from this research predominantly relate to the combination of Project Management and Soft Systems Methodology, based on the Embedding model. Findings relate to how the problem of paradigmatic incommensurability affects pluralist practice, issues related to the use of tools and techniques governed by paradigms other than that for which they were designed, and specific adaptations that were made in suiting Project Management and Soft Systems Methodology to the needs of the project environment.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Systems.</field><field name="subject">Technology.</field><field name="subject">Paradigms.</field><field name="subject">Project management.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relinquishment and abjection: a semanalysis of the meaning of losing a baby to adoption</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Between 1960 and 1975 more than 38,000 mothers lost babies to adoption in New South Wales, Australia, a pattern which was replicated in other Western societies.  Various theories were proposed for women's exnuptial pregnancies which resulted in their babies being taken for adoption, culminating in the discursive construction of the unmarried mother as 'mad, bad, or stupid'. Until the 1990s, the voices of women whose babies had been taken for adoption had been silenced by the social order which adoption practices served. It is through their voices, and through the voices of other women who remember the era of the adoption bounty, that another meaning for the loss of a baby to adoption, through the process of semanalysis, has been sought.  This thesis is informed primarily by the writings of the French postmodern feminist, Julia Kristeva. In addition the works of the post-structuralist philosopher, Michel Foucault, the German socialist feminist, Frigga Haug, and the American feminist psychologist, Michelle Fine are used as an heuristic lens through which to examine the phenomenon of losing a baby to adoption. A qualitative research methodology, incorporating feminist praxis and feminist multiple methods, has been employed.  The framework for this thesis is that of a double helix which depicts two orders, the symbolic and the semiotic, which intertwine and intersect. The symbolic order is analogous to the public social order which through its hegemonic discourses constructed the unmarried mother and adoption. The semiotic order refers to the personal space where the voices of women are heard through counterdiscourses. At the scission of the two helical strands sits the thetic phase, a point of rupture by the semiotic into the symbolic where the voices of mothers are expressed through their poetry and art.  Through the process of semanalysis, the tensions which simultaneously resist and challenge the semiotic and symbolic orders are exposed: tensions between discourse, discipline and docility; power and knowledge; sexuality and silence; power of / as sexuality; power and resistance; and resistance and / as silence. Furthermore, I examine the manifestations of mothers' resistance to silence, and their resistance as activism.  My concluding analysis involves the notion of abjection as it binds together the threads of the loss of a baby to adoption: abjection as entrapment; abjection as infertility; and abjection as / in reunion. For mothers who lost babies to adoption, their loss finds meaning in the ultimate horror: it is abjection.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adoption</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Unmarried mothers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/295</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structured graphs: a visual formalism for scalable graph based tools and its application to software structured analysis</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Very large graphs are difficult for a person to browse and edit on a computer screen. This thesis introduces a visual formalism, structured graphs, which supports the scalable browsing and editing of very large graphs. This approach is relevant to a given application when it incorporates a large graph which is composed of named nodes and links, and abstraction hierarchies which can be defined on these nodes and links. A typical browsing operation is the selection of an arbitrary group of nodes and the display of the network of nodes and links for these nodes. Typical editing operations is: adding a new link between two nodes, adding a new node in the hierarchy, and moving sub-graphs to a new position in the node hierarchy. These operations are scalable when the number of user steps involved remains constant regardless of how large the graph is. This thesis shows that with structured graphs, these operations typically take one user step. We demonstrate the utility of structured graph formalism in an application setting. Computer aided software engineering tools, and in particular, structured analysis tools, are the chosen application area for this thesis, as they are graph based, and existing tools, though adequate for medium sized systems, lack scalability. In this thesis examples of an improved design for a structured analysis tool, based on structured graphs, is given. These improvements include scalable browsing and editing operations to support an individual software analyst, and component composition operations to support the construction of large models by a group of software analysts. Finally, we include proofs of key properties and descriptions of two text based implementations.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer software development</field><field name="subject">graphic methods</field><field name="subject">computer programs</field><field name="subject">computer simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To what extent is the deep enjoyment of flow experienced in primary classroom learning, and under what teaching and learning conditions might the deep enjoyment of flow be facilitated ?</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The primary purposes of this research were to identify if and how a selected teacher and her class experience deep enjoyment as flow in the classroom, and if they do have that experience, to investigate the teaching and learning factors that facilitate that deep enjoyment.  In particular this research had the following three aims:  1.	to explore the conditions and activities that are identifiable in learner's perceptions of their deep enjoyment or flow in learning. 2.	to identify the component characteristics of flow articulated in the learners' stories about their enjoyable learning experiences. 3.	to identify and examine perceptions of deep enjoyment or flow in learning in teacher practice and student learning through a teacher's stories of her teaching experience and through classroom observations.  The research involved a case study of a teacher in a state school Year 5/6 classroom, and seventeen of her students.  Qualitative data were collected from interviews with the teacher, interviews with the students, and field observations recorded in the researcher's journal over a period of several months.  These data, analysed by using the NUD*IST software, provide valuable insight into how the teacher and her students perceive their teaching and learning experiences.  The children and their teacher do experience enjoyment, often the deep enjoyment of flow in their classroom.  A classroom culture was identified that includes teaching characteristics, environmental, and instructional variables, which help facilitate deeply enjoyable flow in meaningful learning. This research concludes that the intellectual knowledge is available which will make flow facilitating classroom cultures achievable.  Achieving such a classroom culture is possible when educators identify and value the enjoyment of flow, with its subsequent sense of learner control, confidence, success, well-being, energy and motivation to learn.  To do this, educators need to identify and implement the teaching and learning strategies available that facilitate the experience, with the intention of ensuring recurrent learner success from the early years of school attendance.  Such a change in the educational ethos would lead to successful, enjoyable and vibrant learning experiences for teacher and learner in the classroom.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational psychology</field><field name="subject">Classroom management</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/297</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perception of Change in Education, Training and Development in the NSW Police Service, Post the Wood Royal Commission</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study examined the perception held by members of the NSW Police Service as to the effectiveness of changes made to education, training and development, post the recommendations made by the Wood Royal Commission in 1997.  The Commission report highlighted a number of important education, training and development issues.  The literature on policing indicated that police jurisdictions have a need to both anticipate and respond to changes and events occurring in the communities they serve.  This study thus examined both the general and police literature covering change, culture, management and leadership, professionalisation and the main education, training and development topics that were included in the Commission report.  An historical scan of developments within the NSW Police Service was also made.  The study basically adopted an empirical, quantitative research methodology, supplemented by qualitative statements made by participants during discussion sessions.  Two separate questionnaires were developed: one for respondents in the broader NSW Police Service (one city and one rural region), and the other for sworn officers and academic staff at the NSW Police Academy.  The Service questionnaire addressed participant perception of the effectiveness or otherwise, of changes made in relevant aspects of individual, team and organisational learning.  Opportunity was also taken to analyse responses to the Service questionnaire, based on a range of selected demographic characteristics.  The Academy questionnaire addressed the perceptions held about the effectiveness or otherwise, of changes made in general learning issues, curriculum development, course delivery and the evaluation of training.  An analysis of combined responses to like questions in both the Service and Academy questionnaires was also made.  Both Pre and Post Royal Commission perceptions, as recorded on a five point Likert scale were collected.  From the resulting mean difference scores potential change in the respondent's perception of the effectiveness of the changes made were determined.  The findings indicated that respondents perceived some improvement in the effectiveness of education, training and development Post the Wood Royal Commission.  There were some important findings related to: (a) perceived differences between the formal Academy recruit training and probationer practicum or field training; (b) the need for 'Professionalisation' Vs 'Craft' training; (c) leadership role models of learning and the creation of a learning culture and climate; (d) the role of knowledge management in intelligence-led and evidence-based policing; (e) the use of information technology and distance learning strategies; (f) the development of reflective practice and the gaining of lessons learnt from experience; (g) the provision of leadership development; (h) support for continuing professional development, as a part of fostering self-managed lifelong learning and, (i) the consistent Quality Assurance review of both the course curriculum and evaluation of training effectiveness at the Academy.  The findings have possible implications for practice and further research in the NSW Police.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Police Force.</field><field name="subject">Training.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/298</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable Ecological and Recreational Management of Sandy Beach Systems</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Sandy beaches are a primary focus of recreational and other pressures from growing coastal populations, and are major natural and economic assets for national and international tourism, but have not received adequate research attention prior to this study. Although the limited ecological research to date indicates that the nearshore volumes of sandy beach systems may be as biologically productive as estuaries and wetlands, the management of sandy beaches has not been based on ecological or sustainability principles.  In this study, the principles and goals of ecologically sustainable development (ESD) are applied in investigations designed to develop improved ecological and recreational management of metropolitan sandy beach ecosystems, whereby ecological functions are maintained simultaneously with recreational and related uses.  The conventional view that sandy beaches are resilient to recreational use, and are more likely to be seriously impacted by other forms of human activity, seems to have precluded serious research investigation of questions such as: what are the responses of both beach biota and human users to environmental variables influencing the system; what are the simultaneous levels, distributions and diversity of beach biota in relation to levels, distributions and categories of beach users; and what ecological impacts are likely from human beach use on biota at points of interaction, temporally and spatially? From the first section of the project, it has been shown that our present understanding of the functions, processes and responses to human disturbances of sandy beach ecosystems is extremely poor, compared with that of rock platforms. New methodologies have been developed in the current study for experimental investigations into aspects of sandy beach ecology and recreational use which have never previously been considered. Relationships between environmental variables and categories of beach use have been quantified, and show promise for use in predictive modelling to guide management.  Current approaches to the management of sandy beaches and beach recreation, as aspects of environmental and coastal resource management, were then critically examined. The structures, functions and decision-making procedures of the major spheres of government, and their management agencies, were evaluated and found to provide inherent obstacles to effective ecological and recreational management of ecosystems. Coastal resource and beach management by public agencies were assessed for Durban and Sydney. Comparative analysis has provided information that can be used to develop guidelines for integrated ecologial and recreational management of sandy beach systems. In a synthesis of all of the above findings, a new procedural model has been constructed, for sustainable ecological and recreational management of sandy beach systems. This model is proposed as a framework for future integrated coastal resource research and management.

Modifying rivers has brought great benefit to communities, fulfilling important community goals - supporting profitable commercial activities and providing a basis for vibrant communities. However modifying rivers has also had negative consequences - in particular, a decline in the quality and quantity of water. These impacts have undermined valued aspects of rivers (such as fish habitat) and have also caused decline in commercial activities (such as fishing and floodplain grazing).  This thesis explores the ways that these contending perceptions of modification work out on the ground in rural communities. How are the benefits of modification recognised? How are the negative consequences of modification noticed and measured? Under what conditions are the benefits of modification reassessed? These are important questions in the current moment as our society reassesses the past modification of rivers and attempts to move towards more sustainable use of natural resources. This thesis explores this topic by undertaking in depth case-studies of two distinctive riverine environments: one coastal, the Clarence River in luscious coastal northern New South Wales; and one inland, the Balonne River, at the top of the Murray-Darling Basin, in semi-arid south-west Queensland. The case studies explore responses to modification of the rivers in two periods: the post-war decades - a time of widespread support for modification, and recent decades - a time of widespread recognition of the negative consequences of development. The thesis investigates perceptions of modification at three different scales: (i) groups within localities - the ways that modification is perceived by local groups with contrasting physical and conceptual interactions with the rivers (such as graziers, fishers, irrigators, Aboriginal people, ecologists and engineers); (ii) regional communities - which are constituted by groups with differing interests, and (iii) governments - which have the role of managing the long-term health of the economy and the environment, despite the long-term goals often being contested.  This thesis provides insights into the ways that our complex society grapples with the possibility, and effects, of modifying the natural environment. This thesis suggests that local conditions - the actual local physical environment and local social conditions - shape the ways that modification of rivers is supported, challenged and reassessed. However, both local social conditions and the environment are constantly changing, often in surprising ways. Therefore outcomes are always an interaction between different levels of interest groups and the environment itself.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rivers</field><field name="subject">Control</field><field name="subject">Change</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-conceptualising Competency-based Education and Training : with particular reference to education for occupations in Australia.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The thesis that emerges from the publications nominated for examination, is that a holistic or integrated competency based approach to vocational education and training (VET) and professional education (both initial and continuing) has many advantages over traditional approaches: * It provides a curriculum framework which links practice to theory in more coherent ways than currently exist; * It potentially provides a way of breaking the old dichotomy between 'knowing that' and 'knowing how' which has characterised Anglo-Saxon education and which has resulted in the belief that education which is practical is both different from and inferior to that which is abstract; * It provides the basis for teaching and learning approaches which could enhance students' adaptability and flexibility over their lives; * It has the potential for developing in occupational education more valid assessment strategies than those traditionally used and also for reducing the deleterious effects on learning of measurement-based assessment approaches. In summary, it is argued that the integrated approach to competency-based education provides a conceptual base for the competency movement and a promising direction for educational reform for all levels of occupational education. It is further argued that competency standards developed through an integrated approach can facilitate the implementation of a number of other areas of social and economic policy, such as the recognition of qualifications of overseas professionals in Australia, and the internationalisation of professional services.  Overview of the publications  The publications span a six-year period from 1990 to 1996. The first of them was written at a time when there was very little literature in the area (and virtually none in Australia) and when there was a great deal of confusion about the nature of competency, how to develop competency standards and the implications of the competency approach for education and training. What literature did exist, was mostly twenty years old and was largely a reaction against educational curricula which, it was felt, had failed to adequately prepare students for occupations or for life more generally. In place of a curriculum based on the acquisition of knowledge most of the critics suggested that curriculum should be based on an analysis of what people needed to do. Conceptually, as Wolf (1995) and others have pointed out, it was based on a niave reductionism arising out of behaviourist approaches to education. This approach was quite powerful for a brief period in the 1970s in teacher education programs in the United States. However the challenge to behaviourism from cognitive and humanist approaches to learning seemed to undermine the conceptual basis of the competency movement and very little was written about competency approaches until the late 1980s.  As Raven (1996) has recently pointed out, the literature on competency-based education which has appeared recently is also a reaction against 'something that is sensed to be wrong' (p.74). But what this is, what needs to be achieved and how this could be done is not clear. He suggests that the contemporary competency literature lacks a conceptual and analytical base and that there is little recognition of the need for a research program which develops a better understanding of the nature of competence, how it might be developed in individuals, how it might be assessed and what impact this would have on individuals, organisations and society generally. It is these issues that the publications submitted for examination have addressed. They have attempted to provide a conceptual base for competency-based education and a framework for how competency might be developed and assessed. Much of the recent literature in Australia has built on the approach which the publications originated.  The publications can be divided into those dealing with the nature of competency, particularly the integrated model, (a, b, d, e) those dealing with curriculum and teaching issues (b, j) and those dealing with assessment of competence (c, f, h, i, k). The theme which unites them, is the integrated approach to competency and its capacity to provide a coherent framework for improved educational practices in all occupational education. Another possible way of categorising the publications would be by educational level. For reasons associated with the traditional division of labour in our workforces we tend to think about the differences between educational levels rather than the similarities. It is usual to think about higher education for example, even when it prepares people for occupations, as substantially different from other occupational education. This is underlined by the fact that there is no term, in common usage, to encompass both what is currently referred to as middle level or vocational education, and education for the professions. Despite its specific nature, professional education is often identified with academic and general education, while vocational education is identified with practical education and is assumed to be devoid of substantial theoretical content. In fact much of higher education for the professions is practical and much vocational education is grounded in theory, even if it is not always made explicit. A conclusion which I believe can be drawn from these publications as a whole is that the difference between higher education for the professions and vocational education for middle level occupations is one of degree rather than one of kind. Obviously most professional work is more complex than work at, say, trades level. But it is better to conceptualise these levels on a continuum rather than to see them as essentially different. There will be many instances when professionals need to do things which are routine where simple competencies are used. Conversely many tradespeople will need to use complex combinations of competencies to solve challenging problems. Hence, it is not useful to divide the publications into those dealing specifically with the professions (of which there are six- a, b, c, d, g, i) and those dealing with issues relevant to all sectors of education (of which there are five- e, f, h, j, k). What the publications have to say about the nature of competency, how to develop competency through curricula and teaching and how to assess it, is broadly applicable to all occupational education irrespective of the context in which it is discussed.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Competency based education</field><field name="subject">Vocational education</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The lived experience of laterlife computer learners</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Older adults of the 21st century have not grown up with information and communication technology and may not have used computers in their working lives. However, they have experienced the many technological changes of the 20th century. Some changes have fundamentally altered communication, entertainment, and the kinds of knowledge and skills that are sought and valued. These changes are difficult to ignore because of their pervasiveness. In order to actively participate in their lifeworlds older adults face an imperative to adapt and meet new challenges.  The purpose of this research was to investigate and interpret the lived experience of laterlife computer learners in non-formal learning environments. The research focused on the interpretation and understanding of the learning experience from the perspective of participants. Hence there is an ontological thread that is grounded in the lifeworld of older adults in Sydney, Australia. A hermeneutic phenomenological methodology was considered suitable because of its emphasis on understanding the lived experience of humans. A qualitative method was used in this study because it enabled existential insights into the learning experience from the perspective of learners and privileged their voices.  Fourteen older adults volunteered to participate and were interviewed. Participants identified themselves as laterlife beginning computer learners. Interviews were audio-taped and analysed using an interpretative case study approach. Other analytic tools used were grounded theory, thematic analysis and narrative inquiry. Existential themes were identified and interpreted within a framework of wellbeing.  The research found that participants engaged in learning optimistically and that they believed in their abilities and also in the worth of the learning they were undertaking. The learners believed the outcomes from learning would lead to greater opportunity for participation in their lifeworld. Without computer skills and knowledge they believed they would be ignored and relegated to a peripheral position as observers in their lifeworld. By undertaking learning they believed they were taking control of their current and future lives, acting in defiance of developmental theories that suggested ageing was a stage of life and not a process. However, the sense of agency and purpose was not without its pressures and hurdles and learning was perceived to be difficult, dynamic, frustrating and immensely satisfying. Their purposes and expectations were situated in the changing nature of the world and a desire to continue to live their lives authentically, as participants and not spectators. Laterlife computer learners in this study were seen to be learning and growing their lives into a future of their making.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computers</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">aging</field><field name="subject">continuing education</field><field name="subject">interviews</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Class and Object Modularity Description and Measurement</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Software measurement has been of interest to software engineers for almost as long as software has been developed. While the evolution of systematic processes of software development has seen a trend away from reliance on the expertise of individual software developers alone to ensure software quality, systematic processes of software measure development have not evolved to a similar extent. The problem with defining software measures according to an informal process is that the quality of measures can be highly dependent on the expertise of the individual measure developers. If a systematic process of software measure development were defined, that promoted transparency and objectivity in measure development, then this systematic process could support the development of high quality measures by less expert users. In this thesis, a systematic process of software descriptive measure development is described and demonstrated. The approach taken to defining this systematic process is to investigate the various processes by which currently available software descriptive measures have been developed. These processes are then amalgamated with an established systematic method of measure development used in the field of social science. Applying the stages of measure development thus identified to the task of developing measures to describe C++ class and object modularity tests the feasibility of this measure development process. Insights gained through this testing provide feedback to further refine the process. In this way, a systematic process of descriptive software measure development is defined alongside the definition of a set of measures that provide a detailed description of the complex software characteristic of modularity. The products of each stage of this measure development process assist a user to validate the measures with respect to an intended application, and to analyse and interpret the measurement data obtained by applying the measures to a software system. This is demonstrated in a case study that also provides an indirect indication of the quality of the process by which the measures were developed. The major contribution of this work is the systematic process of descriptive software measure development, as it has a wide application and can be used to develop measures to describe many software characteristics of interest. A second important contribution is made by the set of measures of C++ class and object modularity developed to demonstrate this systematic descriptive measure development process.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Software</field><field name="subject">Measurement</field><field name="subject">Quality</field><field name="subject">Object Oriented Methods</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Practitioner Researcher perspective on facilitating an open, infinite, chaordic simulation. Learning to Engage with Theory while Putting Myself Into Practice</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis investigates two intertwined themes. The first concerns the development of a framework for understanding, and making appropriate use of, simulations and games as tools for learning. The second concerns the utilisation of the term PractitionerResearcher to reflect the unity of practice and research activity in creating 'working knowledge' (Symes 2000). These themes are intertwined in the sense that the route I take to understanding simulations and games is through the stance of a PractitionerResearcher. Conversely the thesis aims to draw out what it means to be a PractitionerResearcher through my engagement as a facilitator of simulations and games. I argue that the knowledge I generate as a PractitionerResearcher is utilitarian and pragmatic.  Grounded in my practice as an adult educator it utilises theoretical perspectives chosen for immediate relevance rather than because of any claims to 'truth' or permanence. Understanding how this shapes and influences my practice was a complex, difficult process. Using an auto-ethnographic approach, Chapter 1 outlines the development of my 'working knowledge' as a PractitionerResearcher. It draws on selected personal experiences in my work as an adult educator using simulations and games for teaching and learning. While curiosity about historical facts initiated the research reported in Chapter 2, the chapter focuses on uses of historical precedent for generating greater understanding, and acceptance by participants, of simulations and games as teaching/learning strategies. It identifies a range of contributions - from war games, religious games, and children's play - to the structuring of modern educational simulations and games. Chapter 3 explores approaches to classifying simulations and games. Its development brought a gradual realisation of the futility of trying to establish a single definitive categorisation system for all simulations and games. Understanding how they can be arranged in a variety of different relationships provides a better insight into their general features and helps in making decisions about when and how to use specific activities. One outcome of the work for this chapter was the realisation of some simulations as 'open and infinite' in nature, and that XB - simulation of importance in my practice - is such a simulation. Chapter 4 uses concepts developed in the field of chaos theory to illustrate how certain simulations create messy but 'chaordic' (Hock 2002) rather than dis-orderly learning contexts. 'Chaos/chaotic' once meant only dis-order, 'messiness' and unpredictability. Twentieth century scientific discoveries illustrate that order is concealed within 'chaos' producing richly complex patterns when viewed from the right perspective. I argue that 'chaos' concepts can be usefully applied to open and infinite simulations to demonstrate how they are similarly 'chaordic'. XB (for eXperience Based learning) is an open, infinite chaordic simulation, and has been a driving force in my practice for six years. The case study in Chapter 5 introduces the 'world according to XB' and takes the reader 'inside' participants' experiences as the unfolding nature of their learning is revealed in the way they apply theories of organisational behaviour to immediate behaviours. Chapter 6 reflects on my experiences of facilitating XB, via a review of interactions with some past XB participants. The influence of such a learning process on my practice is analysed. The emotional impact of these interactions has brought a better understanding of my own practice, and the chapter considers the concept of 'dispassionate reflexivity' as an aid for the facilitator in such contexts. Chapter 7 examines the evolution and distinctive features of the PractitionerResearcher in more detail. As an educator, a consistent focus of my work has been simultaneously 'to know more' and 'to be able to do better' - and it is the interdependence of these that lies at the heart of what it means to be a PractitionerResearcher. It is my hope that this thesis offers a solution for practitioners wanting to combine 'research' and 'practice' into a practical and scientifically rigorous 'whole'. For such professionals the PractitionerResearcher model offers an integrated approach, combining and validating 'learning in action' and 'learning for action'.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Practitioner</field><field name="subject">Researcher</field><field name="subject">Experiential learning</field><field name="subject">Educational games</field><field name="subject">Simulation games</field><field name="subject">Working knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theorising information use: managers and their work</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The focus of this thesis is information use. Although a key concept in information behaviour, information use has received little attention from information science researchers. Studies of other key concepts such as information need and informationseeking are dominant in information behaviour research. Information use is an area of interest to information professionals who rely on research outcomes to shape their practice. There are few empirical studies of how people actually use information that might guide and refine the development of information systems, products and services.  The thesis begins to address this imbalance in information behaviour research by exploring the concept of information use through an empirical study. Fifteen senior managers from two organisations in the cultural industries sector participated in the study. Analysis of interviews revealed that the managers understood and experienced information use in five different ways: as information packaging; as information flow; as developing new knowledge and insights; as shaping judgements and decisions; and as influencing others.  These five different ways of experiencing information use are related in a hierarchy that reflects three different views of information: as an object; as a construct; and as a transformative force. Embedded in the hierarchy are different relations between people and information in their work environments, different processes of information use and different criteria for determining the quality of information that is used.  The thesis demonstrates that the concept of information use can be explored empirically using phenomenography as the research approach. This approach, which originated in the field of education, has been used infrequently in information behaviour research. It offers potential for the further exploration of not only information use but also other concepts germane to information behaviour. The thesis highlights the richness of peoples' experiences of information use and points to some directions that might be taken by practitioners in developing information systems, products and services to support people as they 'go about their business'.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information resources management</field><field name="subject">Corporations</field><field name="subject">Information services</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/309</field></doc><doc><field name="title">History in Australian popular culture : 1972-1995</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">As cultural studies has consolidated its claim to constitute a distinct field of study in recent years, debate has intensified about its characteristic objects, concepts and methods, if any, and, therefore, its relationship to traditional disciplines in the Humanities and Social Sciences. In History in Australian Popular Culture 1972-1995, I focus on an intersection of cultural studies with history. However, I do not debate the competing claims of 'history' and 'cultural studies' as academic projects. Rather, I examine the role played by historical discourse in popular cultural practices, and how those practices contest and modify public debate about history; I take 'historical discourse' to include argument about as well as representation of the past, and so to involve a rhetorical dimension of desire and suasive force that varies according to social contexts of usage. Therefore, in this thesis I do cultural studies empirically by asking what people say and do in the name of history in everyday contexts of work and leisure, and what is at stake in public as well as academic 'theoretical' discussion of the meaning and value of history for Australians today. Taking tourism and television ('public culture') as my major research fields, I argue that far from abolishing historical consciousness -- as the 'mass' dimension of popular culture is so often said to do -- these distinct but globally interlocking cultural industries have emerged in Australian conditions as major sites of historical contestation and pedagogy. Tourism and television are, of course, trans-national industries which impact on the living-space (and time) of local communities and blur the national boundaries so often taken to define the coherence of both 'history' and 'culture' in the modern period. I argue, however, that the historical import of these industries includes the use of the social and cultural spaces they make available by people seeking to publicise their own arguments with the past, their criticisms of the present, and their projects for the future; this usage is what I call 'popular culture', and it can include properly historical criticism of the power of tourism and television to disrupt or destroy a particular community's sense of its past. From this it follows that in this thesis I defend cultural studies as a practice which, far from participating in a 'death' or 'killing' of history, is capable of accounting in specific ways for the liveliness of historical debate in Australia today.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Popular culture</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Civilization</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language diversity and linguistic identity in Brittany: a critical analysis of the changing practice of Breton</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis explores the ways in which linguistic diversity is represented, articulated and theorised in the context of the promotion of Breton, a minority or lesser-used language spoken in the region of Brittany in western France. In doing so it seeks to provide a critical analysis of the changing practice of Breton and the different ways in which the language is mobilised as a vehicle for personal and collective identity. It provides a historical reading of the development of a sense of Breton identity through the language, locating the changing practice of Breton, particularly following the revival movement that began in the 1960s, in a socio-political and socio-cultural context.  In tracking these functional and symbolic transformations of Breton, the thesis takes a theoretical approach that can broadly be described as belonging to the discipline of critical language studies. Working from this critical perspective, it explores the way different language ideologies frame issues of linguistic diversity and examines the way notions of language, linguistic diversity and identity are epistemologically constructed. In doing so it argues the need for greater critical awareness of the effects these ideologies may have on diversity, with a view to developing more effective ways of promoting diverse language practices and linguistic identities in Brittany.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breton</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">Brittany</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">diversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Space Efficient Visualisation of Large Hierarchies</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Relational information visualisation concerns viewing relational data, where the underlying data model is a graph. Hierarchical visualisation is one of hot topics in graph visualisation in which the data is organised in a hierarchical structure. As the amount of information, that we want to visualise, becomes larger and the relations become more complex, classical visualisation techniques and hierarchical drawing methods tend to be inadequate.Traditional hierarchical visualisation algorithms are more concerned with the readability of the layouts. They usually do not consider the efficient utilisation of the geometrical plane for the drawings. Therefore, for most hierarchical layouts, a large portion of display space is wasted as background. The aim of this research is to investigate a space-efficient approach to handle the visualisation of large hierarchies in two-dimensional spaces. This thesis introduces a new graph visualisation approach called enclosure+ connection for visualizing large hierarchies. This approach maximises the space utilisation by taking advantages of the traditional enclosure partitioning approach, while it retains the display of a traditional node-link diagram to hopefully provide users a direct perception of relational structures. The main contribution of this thesis is layout and navigation algorithms for visualising large hierarchies. Two layout algorithms, the space-optimised tree and the EncCon tree, have been developed to achieve the space-efficient visualisation. Both algorithms use the enclosure concept to define layout of hierarchies, which ensure the efficient utilisation of display space. Two focus+context navigation and interaction methods have been proposed to cooperate with the visualization of large hierarchies. Several advanced computer graphics approaches, such as graphic distortion and transparency, are used for the development of these navigation methods.  Two case studies have been implemented to evaluate the layout algorithms and the associated navigation methods. The first case study is an application of a shared collaborative workspace which aims to provide users with a better assistance for visual manipulation and navigation of knowledge-based information. The second case study is a visual browser for navigating large-scale online product catalogues.  Although the case studies have provided some useful evaluation, formal usability studies would be required to justify fully the effectiveness of these layout and navigation methods. Although this task has not carried out in this research, the author has presented his usability study's plan as a future work.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visualisation</field><field name="subject">Trees (graph theory)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Not Quite/ Just the Same/ Different: the Construction of Identity in Vietnamese War Orphans Adopted by White Parents</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Global diasporas caused by wars carry many streams of people - in the 1970s one of these streams contained orphans from Vietnam delivered to white parents in the West.  On arrival, the social expectation was that these children would blend seamlessly into the culture of their adoptive parents.  Now some adoptees, as adults, reflect on their lives as 'Asian' or racially 'Other' children in white societies, charting the critical points in their maturation.  This thesis interrogates their life histories to explore the role of birth-culture in the self-definition of people removed from that culture at birth or in childhood.  Thirteen adult adopted Vietnamese participants were interviewed.  These interviews provided qualitative data on issues of racial and cultural identity.  These data were developed and analysed, using a framework drawn from symbolic interactionism and cultural studies, in order to reveal the interpersonal dynamics in which people were involved, and the broader cultural relations that sustained them.  The findings reveal that in early childhood the adopted Vietnamese identity process was shaped by a series of identifications with, and affirmations of, sharing their adoptive parents racial and cultural identity.  Such identifications were then challenged once the adoptees entered society and were seen by others as different.  The participants' attempts to locate a secure sense of self and identity within the world they are placed in are disturbed by numerous uncertainties surrounding racial and cultural difference.  One of the most crucial uncertainties is the adopted Vietnamese knowledge about their cultural background.  While most felt they lacked positive knowledge about Vietnam and racial diversity, their sense of identity was unsettled by experiences with racism and negative cultural stereotypes throughout their late childhood to adolescence.  As their recognition and acceptance of their difference develops in adulthood, they experience a degree of empowerment due to their being able to access more knowledge about their cultural background and a greater appreciation of racial diversity.  Many participants have formed closer ties with other people born in Vietnam, most notably other adoptees; most returned to visit Vietnam.  The thesis concludes that those adoptees who were able to develop an understanding of the Vietnamese and other backgrounds to their complex identities, tended to be more integrated as adults than those who either rejected or were unable to come to terms with their Vietnamese ancestry.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">Social inquiry</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Adoption</field><field name="subject">Cultural identity</field><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">Cultural adaptation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Fantasy of Exile : Some reflections on the margins of the 'Unhomely Consciousness'</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis is about exile, but exile of a particular nature. I take the term exile discursively and textually, with no particular regard to historical specificities it may offer. In this sense I intend to use the concrete to render the abstract, working backwards from the historically and generally recognised condition of exile - the relegated, the diasporic - to its discursive relocation in various forms of narrative, reflection and representation. In this the measure of the exile will be the continuities re d discontinuities of the discourses of its location.  The thesis will argue that the exilic subject - that is, the subject of modern consciousness - is the product of a certain fantasy formation of a subjective homeland projected onto the various margins of discourse, history and geography. This fantasy leads to a fascination and identification of things perceived at the margins or the bounds of a psychopathological homeland, rendering the homeland itself the site of alienation. The thesis argues against the positioning of the subject as alienated 'lack' in favour of a subjective and representative plenitude. The thesis will look to various discourses alienation and ideology, with a particular focus on the philosophy of reflection, phenomenology and psychoanalytic theory (the philosophy of the 'unreflected') to trace a sort of exilic affectability that inheres in the representation of the modern subject.  The introductory chapter 'Parenthesis' picks at the relation between the discourses of post-structuralist and post-colonial theory, looking to their fascination with the margins and positing a certain intellectual and political tendency to fantasy. Chapters One and Two explore the problem of representation in these discourses with particular emphasis on the disposition of the subject and its relation to its own reading or metaphysical positioning, taking as its metaphor the representation: relation between the map and the territory. Chapters Three and Four look to the ontogenesis of the subject of exile and its reflective and metaphysical positioning in representation. Chapter Five closes the thesis with an exposition on the fantasy of subjective and representative closure. The fantasy of exile as the fantasy of closure proper.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exile (punishment) in Literature</field><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Birthing business in the Bush: It's time to listen.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The challenge of ameliorating or preventing the health problems of Indigenous Australians living in remote areas is compounded by the profound professional, cultural, social and personal isolation of the health professionals who work there. This isolation has direct effects on the recruitment and retention of health professionals to remote communities, and their ability to work effectively in this unfamiliar environment. The overarching goal of this research was to strengthen the capacity of these professionals to improve the quality of remote area maternity services in Australia and the experiences and outcomes for birthing women and their families. This was achieved by investigating a process of engagement with a wide range of stakeholders and utilising contemporary communication technology through the Internet. A case study approach was undertaken using participatory action research (PAR) with the elements off rapid assessment, response and evaluation methods (RARE). The research explored, described and analysed the development of resources aimed at decreasing isolation and increasing communication in the remote setting. Identifying the barriers, facilitators and utility of an information technology intervention was an integral part of the investigation process. The first case study saw the development and evaluation of the Maternity Care in the Bush Web Based Resource Library, designed to decrease the isolation of practitioners from the educational resources and professional expertise available in current literature, guidelines and reports. The second case study targeted isolation from peers, with the development and evaluation of the Remote Links Online Community. This was designed to build partnerships between isolated practitioners, for the purpose of interactive peer support, information exchange and mentoring. The third and fourth case studies were guided by Aboriginal researchers and resulted in the development of the Birthing Business in the Bush Website, designed to decrease practitioners' isolation from cultural knowledge. An integrated component of this Website is the Primary Health Care Guide to Planning Local Maternity Services, designed to decrease the isolation of the health care practitioner from the community in which they are working. Issues related to conducting research in the Australian Indigenous setting have been explored, analysed and detailed. Each case study contributed new knowledge and learning about the challenges and contemporary contexts of remote area maternity service provision in Australia. The use of PAR, and, most particularly, how this can be used in Indigenous research to produce goals that extended beyond the individual researcher's goals, has been described. The current difficulties associated with computer mediated communication, as experienced by remote practitioners, have been highlighted. The research has identified areas of need within the workforce that, if addressed, could contribute to improved health services.  Importantly, the research has documented, acknowledged, honoured and disseminated the voices of Aboriginal women, through the far reaching communication technology that is the Internet. Furthermore, the voices, concerns and conditions of remote maternity services providers were also documented and acknowledged. This workforce, often invisible and poorly valued, was assisted and supported to provide evidenced based, culturally appropriate maternity care, through the resources that were developed. To further progress the lessons taken from the research, recommendations have been developed and are listed in the Conclusion.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">midwifery</field><field name="subject">midwives</field><field name="subject">indigenous health</field><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perspectives on Learning and Information in Flexible Learning Environments</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study explores the perspectives of teachers and learners in flexible learning environments in relation to information and learning, and the implications of these perspectives for the design of effective library and information services. It adopted a case study methodology to investigate three flexible learning academic subjects offered at the University of Wollongong in Autumn Semester (March to June) 2000. Using a contextual and document review, teacher and student questionnaires, and in-depth interviews, data were gathered on participant perspectives on the following key areas of research interest: concepts of flexible learning; the flexible learning environment; the role of the teacher; the role of the learner; methods of communication; concepts of information; methods of presenting information; using information resources and services; the role of the librarian; concepts of learning; the learning process; and the relationships between information, learning and knowledge.  Interview data were analysed using the constant comparative method to identify conceptual categories and higher-level themes within individual cases as well as collectively across all three cases. The main conclusions of the study were that: (1) the ways in which information and learning are conceived are central to understanding information use as part of the learning process; (2) there are a number of identifiable processes or phases involved in using information to learn; (3) the integration of information resources and communication mechanisms is a major benefit of the online learning environment; and (4) the design of the flexible learning environment influences student approaches to learning and the use of information and learning resources. The implications of the study conclusions for library and information services include the need for librarians to develop an understanding of the relationship between information and learning; the need to encourage active engagement with information, qualitative/deep approaches to learning, and critical and interpretative thinking; the need to integrate library resources, services and communication systems into online learning environments; and the need for librarians to develop their roles as collaborative partners with teachers, as guides and facilitators of student learning, as designers of information environments, and as advocates for the incorporation of information resources and services into flexible learning environments. Suggestions for further research include ongoing studies on information conceptualisation and use within flexible learning environments, and a larger scale phenomenographic study of conceptions of information.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flexible Learning</field><field name="subject">Open Learning</field><field name="subject">Libraries</field><field name="subject">Case studies</field><field name="subject">University of Wollongong</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Navigating the change process: The experience of, and ways forward for, facility managers in the residential aged care industry</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The residential aged care industry in Australia has been undergoing change on multiple fronts since the introduction of the Aged Care Act 1997. Some of the sources of this change have been new regulatory systems such as accreditation and certification, concerns about financial viability, problems with recruitment and retention of staff, new models of care and increasing acuity of care provided.  Facility Managers of aged care homes are at the forefront of managing these changes. In spite of their central position within the industry, there has been almost no research on the general role and functions of Facility Managers and even less that focuses on their role in the management of change. Using a constructivist methodology, this study set out to address this lack of research and to develop a range of practical proposals concerning the management of change in the sector. The research questions the study sought to answer were: 1.	How is the role of managing change perceived and understood within the overall role of Facility Managers? 2.	How is the role of managing change approached by Facility Managers? 3.	How do Facility Managers learn to manage change? 4.	Do Facility Managers need to be supported in their efforts to manage change and, if so, how should that support be provided, and by whom?  Data for the project came from one-to-one interviews with two groups: a randomly chosen cross-section of Facility Managers and a purposive sample of senior stakeholders within the sector. Thematic analysis was used to draw out patterns and themes in the interview transcripts, and to develop interpretations and connections to the literature.  The study found that there is not a clear understanding of how the management of change fits into the role of Facility Managers, and that the management of change is an issue that is in the background of management thinking and practice in the sector. The change management aspects of the Facility Manager's role have been largely ignored or taken for granted. This can lead to stress on the individual manager as well as reducing the effectiveness of the change process.  There are many ways that Facility Managers can be better supported in the management of change, and the study presents a number of proposals to help achieve this. These focus on general principles and competencies underlying the management of change, an analytical model of change management, and management development practices supporting the management of change.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aged</field><field name="subject">residential</field><field name="subject">housing</field><field name="subject">care</field><field name="subject">facility</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recruitment and age dynamics of Anguilla australis and A. reinhardtii glass eels in the estuaries of New South Wales</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Shortfin eels (Anguilla australis) and longfin eels (A. reinhardtii) are true freshwater eels of the genus Anguilla.  There are many mysteries still unsolved for the freshwater eel lifecycle, such as location of the spawning grounds, conditions that promote metamorphosis from the leptocephalid to glass eel phase, and the mechanisms that affect glass eel recruitment.  In Australia, little is also known about the estuarine habitats of glass eels as they migrate towards freshwater, and the age at which these eels enter estuaries.  Both species are of commercial importance in the estuary fishery where they are caught in eel traps for export.  There is also a small, but potentially lucrative, aquaculture industry for ongrowing glass eels to market demand size.  This thesis investigates the spatial and temporal recruitment of both species of glass eels to estuaries within NSW, the habitats that may be of importance to them as they continue their upstream migration, and the age at which these eels entered the estuaries.  Firstly, a new sampling device needed to be developed since conventional methods to catch glass eels often required constant observation of gear, multiple operators, specific physical site characteristics, and/or were expensive.  The artificial habitat collectors that were developed were then used to sample six estuaries in NSW monthly within one week of the new moon.  Shortfins showed a more consistent and defined recruitment across all sites than longfins, where the peak shortfin recruitment season was from April - August.  Longfins recruited primarily from January - May but often recruited outside of this period.  Five year collections at one of these sites provided important recruitment information.  It appeared that longfins failed to recruit to this site during 2000/01, which could affect commercial catches of this species when they enter the fishery.  The East Australian Current (EAC) probably transports glass eels from spawning sites in the Coral Sea southward to the east coast of Australia but there was no predicted lag time in the recruitment of eels from northern to southern estuaries.  Therefore, it was not possible to predict the timing of recruitment of glass eels in one estuary based on the timing of recruitment in another more northern estuary.  When glass eels enter estuaries their upstream migration is assisted by the night flood tide.  During the ebb tide, glass eels burrow into the substrate and resurface at the next night flood tide.  The eels do not select particular habitats at this time, rather, their location is dictated by the tide.  However, once glass eels reach the estuarine/freshwater interface, they may prefer more complex habitats such as seagrass/macrophytes or rocks/cobbles in which to hide during the day.  At this interface, glass eels undergo a physiological change to adapt to a freshwater existence and this change may take up to a few weeks.  During this time, glass eels commonly enter the water column during the night flood tide and may be able to locate more suitable habitats in which to hide during the day.  The ages of shortfin and longfin glass eels caught in estuaries were examined both spatially and temporally.  As the EAC travels north to south, glass eels recruiting to the southern sites were expected to be older.  However, shortfins that recruited to the northern-most site in this thesis were older than at all other sites while there was no difference in the ages of longfins.  Also, when the ages of longfins that recruited during the main recruitment period were compared to the ages of longfins that recruited outside of this period, there was no difference in ages.  Therefore, the hypothesis that these later recruiting eels may have been caught in an eddy prior to their estuarine arrival has been disproved.  The ages of shortfins that recruited in two separate years were significantly different from each other and may be due to shortfins' ability to detrain more easily from the weaker currents that exist at these recruitment periods.  Conversely, there was no difference in the ages of longfins that recruited in the same month during three separate years.  The estimated hatch dates for shortfins was estimated at October to January, while for longfins, estimated hatch time was July to September for eels that recruited during the peak recruitment period.  For longfins that recruited outside of the main recruitment period, estimated hatch times were from December to February.  It is unknown, however, whether longfins have an extended spawning period, or whether silver eels arrived at the spawning grounds later and thus produced later arriving longfins.  Continuous monitoring of glass eel recruitment to estuaries is necessary to determine whether there are long term declines in the recruitment of Australian eels similar to the declines recently observed for eels in Europe and Asia.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eels</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">anguilla</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting the Australian Position in International Fashion Design</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Success in fashion design is important both in its own right and because it has positive influences on the culture of a country and because of the favourable ramifications it can have across many unrelated industries. This dissertation investigates the Australian fashion design industry and asks whether there is a place for a semi-autonomous industry regulator of the kind found in other countries. France is a natural choice as a model because on the one hand it has the most success and enjoys the highest prestige in international fashion design, and on the other it has a well-developed support and accreditation structure, the Federation Francaise de la Couture, du Fret-a-Porter des Couturiers et des Createurs de Mode. The Federation oversees the whole process, promoting and protecting innovation in the industry and laying down the criteria used in fashion accreditation. These observations led to the question, if a parallel fashion designers' organization were introduced in Australia, what are the chances it would be suitable and effective? To answer this question, interviews were conducted in Australia and in three European countries. The major systematic enquiry was based on a sample of 48 local industry people in key positions in media, commerce and education, who were encouraged to describe and evaluate the industry and to supply answers to a systematic survey document. Candour was promoted by the anonymity of the survey process. The major outcome in terms of evaluation of the industry was that for historical and structural reasons Australian fashion design is not characterized by a high volume of original work. Consequently it is not having much impact internationally and the upper echelons are not providing the basis for downward diffusion of ideas. If the standard (French) classification were applied to Australia, the bulk of the labels would be categorized at the lower end of the scale. The informants provided a strong consensus regarding the nature of the shortfalls including the undue emphasis given to derivative design, the lack of special support for young talent and the low priority given to the synergy between art and high quality craftsmanship. There was agreement that Australian fashion designers should not focus on product just for local consumers, because fashion in clothing is not central to the minds of the average Australian as it is for example in European countries. Fashion designers might be wise to exploit the position of Australia on the edge of the Asian subcontinent and the pool of potential design talent from other countries within the Australian population. By drawing from the new aesthetics emerging in Australia's pluralistic society, designers could easily be at the cutting edge internationally. They might showcase their work at overseas venues, although not necessarily, in the first instance, in countries like France. Although a full-scale federation-type organization might fail for want of a solid innovative industry upon which it might be based, a limited version of such a controlling body could well succeed. Its task would he to steer new directions in education which develops a pool of creative talent through master classes which focus on understanding original design, the importance of the manual aspect in design and the mechanisms of, and rewards stemming from diffusion. Sponsorship should be granted to endeavours by a collective of such talent to showcase designs abroad. Government funds should be redirected away from the promotion of a generic product to a fashion-designing paradigm emphasizing 'designer handwriting' as the value-added aspect. In addition to exploring these issues, this dissertation provides reflections on the nature of the design process and suggests ways in which fashion design and fashion design education might move to revitalize the industry.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fashion Designers</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Costume</field><field name="subject">Clothing and Dress</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young, Competent Internet-Users: A theory based profile</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis presents a qualitative case study of the skills and characteristics of five competent Internet users aged between 10 and 13 years as they engage in Internet activities reflective of their day -to-day use of this culturally valued cognitive tool. The thesis focuses on their learning during these activities and describes the educational profiles of these young learners.  To uncover and more fully understand the learning experiences of young, competent Internet users an integrated theoretical framework was established. Specifically, relevant components of Situated Cognition, Distributed Cognition and Activity Theory, combined with understandings from several cognitive theories developed my understanding of the Internet -mediated learning environment. This integrated theoretical framework resulted in an Internet -Mediated Learning Model which has enabled a holistic understanding of this complex learning sys tem. This model identifies the three major components making up the Internet -mediated learning system: individual, mediating tool (the Internet) and society, and acknowledges the intertwined relationship between these three elements.  The Internet -Mediated Learning Model considers the cognitive processing capabilities and active participation of the individual; the design features and distributive properties of the Internet; and the transmission of social knowledge and participation in local and global communities afforded by Internet -mediated activity.  The integrated theoretical framework was also instrumental in the research design of this study. Most importantly, as a result of the theoretical stance underpinning the study it was deemed appropriate to allow the participants to engage in Internet mediated activity which was reflective of their day -to-day use of this tool, that is, authentic activity.  The data were collected in two distinct phases using four research methods: questionnaire, observations, think -aloud protocols and follow -up interviews. In the first phase a questionnaire, which included a practical component, was developed to ensure the selection of participants who were competent Internet users. Each participant then chose their own Internet -mediated activity in which to participate. Whilst the participants independently completed this activity they were observed and asked to think -aloud. In the second phase, after analysis of the initial data, a follow -up interview was   conducted to further explore some of the issues which emerged from the first phase of data collection. This interview also included a practical component using the Internet.  Analysis of the data resulted in a profile of the young, competent Internet -user. This profile revealed learning characteristics and skills of the user captured in three broad areas which, for this study, have been titled: Participant Citizen, Tool -Mediated Citizen and Adaptive Citizen.  The Participant Citizen captures the skills and knowledge being developed during Internet -mediated activity which relate to transmission of social knowledge and practices and which enable Internet -users to participate in local and global communities. The Tool -Mediated Citizen uncovers learning related to the design features of the Internet and considers the distributive properties of the tool. The Adapative Citizen reveals learner characteristics which enable Internet -users to manage and negotiate the Internet -mediated environment.  Taken together, the Internet -Mediated Learning Model and profile of the young, competent Internet -user provide an in -depth understanding of learning in this unique and complex environment. This study highlights the value in reconsidering the learner skills and characteristics relevant to current and future generations and questioning our application of preconceived notions of learning to the new and relatively unexplored Internet -mediated learning environment.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A hermeneutic phenomenological study of the lived experience of parenting a child with autism.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">It was identified that there was little published research into the lived experience of parenting a child with autism that utilised a qualitative approach. There was a paucity of material in the literature, beyond single parent accounts, for a nurse to turn to develop a beginning understanding of the experience. There was also little for a parent to compare their own experience with. This study of the lived experience of parenting a child with autism provides an exploration of the experience within the framework of a hermeneutic phenomenological approach. Initially nine parents were interviewed and the resulting transcripts analysed. This analysis was taken to four focus groups to allow the parent's voice to remain active in the refinement of the analysis. The parents reported a strong resonance with the analysis and the discussion fell silent. The experience identified was not that of a series of activities but profound changes to the self of the parent. This is considered in the discussion in the light of the existential challenge to the parent's being posed by the demands of parenting a child with autism.

Due to the complex nature of cement constituents, there is currently no reliable method to quantitatively determine the composition of cement. Partly this arises from the fact that the crystal structure of the main component of cement, tricalcium silicate, has not been fully determined. There has been an increase in the use of Rietveld refinement of powder diffraction data for the analysis of cement in recent years. The method has emerged as a valuable tool for the quantitative determination of the composition of cement. A further advantage of the method is its ability to refine complex crystal structures, such as tricalcium silicate. Despite the increased application of this method, few publications exist concerning the evaluation or improvement of the method for the purpose of cement analysis. In this work, the Rietveld method has been critically investigated as a tool for the identification and quantification of the different phases in cement clinker. Laboratory X-ray, synchrotron, neutron, and combined diffraction data are all used in the investigations. For the first time, comparisons of analysis results using various sources are made, rather than comparing the results from various methods. Inconsistencies in the results were found, and their causes were investigated and identified. The reliability of this method was shown to be dependent on the quality of the diffraction data, both in terms of the counting statistics and the resolution, and on the ability of the structures used in the Rietveld model to describe the phases in the sample. The only previously existing structural model for triclinic tricalcium silicate is shown, in this work, inadequate as a description of the form found in cement. Consequently, the triclinic crystal structures of tricalcium silicate were re-investigated. Using synchrotron powder diffraction data, the lattice dynamics during the T1-T2 transition were observed in detail for the first time. Superstructure reflections were observed for the two structures. The first model for the average sub-structure of the T2 form is presented. Structural modulation in the T1 form was re-investigated. The parent sub-structure, suitable for Rietveld refinement, corresponding modulation wave-vector, and superspace group of the superstructure, were identified.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cement composites</field><field name="subject">Cement clinkers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Induction of Drug Resistance and Differentiation in Human Leukaemia Cell Lines</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The ability of low, clinically relevant levels of the chemotherapeutic drugs epirubicin and vinblastine to induce drug resistance was examined in the K562. U937, KG-la and HEL human leukaemia cell lines. Treatment with epirubicin and vinblastine induced the MDR phenotype and P-glycoprotein expression in K562 and U937 cells. However this treatment had no effect on drug resistance in the P-glycoprotein expressing KG-la and HEL cells. In the U937 cells, drug resistant cells were not only MDR but were also resistant to other drugs including cisplatinum and chlorambucil which are not normally associated with MDR. The drug resistant U937 sublines were also sensitised to doxorubicin, cisplatinum and chlorambucil by buthionine sulphoximine (BSO), suggesting that glutathione-related mechanisms also contributed to resistance in these sublines. The U937 sublines also had an increased DNA content and an increased ability to recover from DNA damage, as determined by cell cycle analysis, indicating that the broad cross-resistance exhibited by these cells was due to the co-existence of multiple resistance mechanisms. Drug treatment induced changes in expression of differentiation associated antigens in all four cell lines. Treatment with inducers of differentiation (TPA, sodium butyrate, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF). Treatment of K562 and K562/E15B cells with TPA induced megakaryocytic differentiation, with increases in drug resistance, and increased P-glycoprotein expression in the K562/E15B subline. TPA induced monocytic differentiation in the U937 cells but not the U937/EIS subline, with increased P-glycoprotein expression and function in the U937/E15 cells but not the U937 cells. Staurosporine, an inhibitor of PKC, inhibited differentiation in these cell lines, but did not inhibit increases in P-glycoprotein expression, suggesting drug resistance was not mediated by PKC. Sodium butyrate induced erythroid differentiation, and increased P-glycoprotein expression in the K562/E15B cells. However at a higher concentration (15 mM) this was not accompanied by increased drug resistance. Granulocyte monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) did not induce differentiation in the K562 cells or K562/E15B subline, although the K562/E15B cells became more drug resistant after treatment with GM-CSF. Treatment with GM-CSF induced differentiation in the U937/E15 subline but did not change drug resistance in either the U937 cells or the U937/EI5 subline. Therefore the P-glycoprotein expressing K562/E15B and U937/E15 sublines were more responsive to inducers of differentiation than the parental cell lines. Induction of differentiation therefore induced increases in P-glycoprotein expression and drug resistance, suggesting that expression of P-glycoprotein or a multidrug resistance phenotype was associated with differentiation.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug resistance</field><field name="subject">cancer cells</field><field name="subject">leukemia</field><field name="subject">chemotherapy.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Telecommuting: current status, future direction</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Telecommuting is a method of work which substitutes telecommunications and technology for the daily journey to, and home from work. Instead of travelling to a central workplace telecommuters work from home or a specially established centre close to their home. The incidence of telecommuting is increasing throughout the world. An extensive search for information on the telecommuting phenomenon reveals that most developed countries in the world have some level of participation in telecommuting. The United States of America certainly leads the way in terms of the numbers of participation and especially the information available. Information on the Australian situation has been difficult to find. It would appear that not many organizations have formal plans or policies regarding telecommuting. Much of the information available for the Australian situation is concerned with the Rural Telecentres programme that whilst not strictly developed for the purposes of telecommuting does provide facilities which can be used by organizations and telecommuters. Based on the reports available telecommuting is a popular choice for many workers. Telecommuters report benefits associated with lifestyle choices and increased work productivity due to lowered stress levels and choices about working hours. Telecommuting has also associated problems for telecommuters varying from being able to set aside a suitably equipped environment at home to concerns about isolation and missed career opportunities. For organizations the benefits also are many including increased productivity, cost savings and worker satisfaction. The problems facing organizations need careful planning to overcome. Organizations have to deal with managerial issues, potential problems associated with insurance and legal exposure, and security concerns. Organizations need to establish formal policy regarding telecommuting in order to address these concerns. Telecommuting has the potential to impact on travel and transport habits and infrastructures. It has the potential to impact positively on the environment by reducing vehicle emissions. Telecommuting, by making work location independent has the potential to affect suburban and rural communities. Issues associated with telecommuting need to be further researched in order to have the information to plan and manage this phenomenon effectively. There is difficulty obtaining information on the Australian experience, even though Australia would be ideally suited due to its geographical isolation to take advantage of the possible benefits.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Telecommuting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community Structure of Cliff-Top Coastal Heathlands in Botany Bay National Park, Sydney</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis examines community structure of cliff-top coastal heathlands in Botany Bay National Park, Sydney. Community properties of floristic composition, structure and species richness are investigated. This investigation is made in order to assess the justification for contemporary pre-emphasis in local studies on individual community properties. It is also made in order to assess the relative and independent contributions of individual properties to variance in overall community structure. It is also made in order to assess the relative utility of multi-property classifications in summarising community structure of cliff-top coastal heathlands.  First, the presence of determinable structure in each property is assessed through multivariate classification of respective data sets. Secondly, a new model of community structure is developed in which the hypothesis that community structure is a function of common (shared) and independent (unique) variance in each of the three properties is assessed. This is achieved through application of variance partitioning using correspondence analysis techniques. Thirdly, a matrix combining variance in all three properties is classified. This classification is compared with those of individual properties in order to assess the hypothesis that more ecologically cohesive classifications than those of single properties are obtainable. The ecological significance (environmental relativity) of all classifications and variance components is assessed through examination of relationships with variance in 20 environmental factors which encompass variation in maritime factors, soil physical factors, soil nutrition factors and effects of time since fire. Classifications of individual properties showed the presence of determinable structure in each. Eleven floristic complexes, nine structural complexes and eighteen species richness complexes were recognised. Nineteen community complexes were recognised from the classification of the combined property matrix. All complexes were shown to differ significantly with respect to multiple environmental factors. Variance partitioning showed the presence of both independent and common variance components with respect to properties compared pairwise. These were all shown to differ in magnitude. Examination of environmental correlates showed ecological differentiation of all properties and most variance components. Maritime and fire factors provide a major axis of environmental differentiation for most properties and variance components. A second major axis was resolved with respect to physical soil factors. With the exception of variance in species richness, major soil nutrients were generally of secondary importance to community structure. Low soil nutrients may demarcate heathlands from other vegetation types. However, this study shows elevated importance of other major areas of environment for community structure within cliff-top coastal heathlands. Comparisons of environmental homogeneity characteristics between all classification systems showed the classification of the combined property matrix to be more ecologically robust than those of structure or species richness. Homogeneity characteristics of the combined classification remained statistically inseparable from that of floristic composition. However, studies provided some evidence suggesting greater robustness of the combined classification with regard to fine-scale variance in community structure. This thesis shows that variance in all major community properties of the studied vegetation to be of ecological significance. It also shows that this significance is differential with respect to properties and their variance components. Pre-emphasis on individual properties in syntheses of local systems thus involves the loss of ecological information. I thus conclude that if adequate ecological syntheses of cliff-top coastal heathlands are to be obtained which are appropriate to their scale of distribution and functioning in the Sydney area then inclusion of attributes of multiple properties is required. Equally, multiple sources of environmental variation need to be examined.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heathlands -- New South Wales -- Sydney</field><field name="subject">-National parks and reserves -- New South Wales -- Botany Bay Region</field><field name="subject">Botany Bay Region (N.S.W.)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuity of maternal care in a community setting: a randomised controlled trial using the Zelen design</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This research investigated a new community-based model of continuity of care provided collaboratively by a small team of midwives and obstetricians (St George Outreach Maternity Project or STOMP). The study considered whether STOMP improved maternal and neonatal clinical outcomes, resulted in a better experience for women and could be implemented within the current resources of a public teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia. A randomised controlled trial using a Zelen design was used to compare the STOMP model with standard care. One thousand and eighty-nine women were randomly allocated to either the STOMP model or standard hospital-based care. The Zelen design was used to increase the participation of women from non-English speaking backgrounds and to reduce disappointment bias in women allocated to the control group.  The results suggest that the model of community-based continuity of care is associated with a lower caesarean section rate, more positive experiences for women and costs less than standard care. There were no differences in the number of medical complications experienced in either group, but more women in the control group were admitted to hospital during the antenatal period. There were four perinatal deaths in each group. Women in the STOMP group reported a higher quality of antenatal care compared with the control group. Women in the STOMP group also reported that the community-based service was accessible and convenient with reduced waiting times for appointments. Women in the STOMP group were more likely to have received adequate information about labour, birth and the postnatal period and felt more 'in control' during labour compared with the control group. Women from both groups reported problems with postnatal care, particularly when provided in the hospital. The study also examined the impact of the STOMP model on women from Chinese and Arabic-speaking backgrounds. The STOMP model appeared to reduce the rate of elective and emergency caesarean section in Chinese-speaking women compared with English-speaking women. Small numbers precluded statistical analysis on these data so the results must be interpreted with caution. Women from Chinese-speaking  backgrounds reported receiving insufficient information. The STOMP model improved the provision of information, however Chinese-speaking women still reported inferior experiences. There were also differences in the method of infant feeding. The results indicate that the model provides effective, cost efficient and satisfying maternity care. New models of maternity care can be implemented within current resources when organisations have a strong commitment to change.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hospitals</field><field name="subject">maternity services</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">sydney</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Australian Digital Theses Program and the Theory of Disruptive Technologies : A case study</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The Theory of Disruptive Technologies put forward by Clayton Christensen in 1997 has attracted significant attention.

This doctorate examines the lack of recognition of midwifery as an autonomous profession and its consequential invisibility in Australian maternity care.Despite the significant amount of evidence that continues to accumulate to support the expansion of midwifery models of care, such changes have not been widespread in Australia. An examination of international, national and local health policy and strategic direction in maternity services, together with a critique of contemporary Australian midwifery and the role of the midwife within the public health system, provide the rationale and context for the study. The 'case' for introducing improved systems and models of maternity care is developed with regard to the evidence for increasing the utilisation of midwifery. The doctorate argues for greater visibility and recognition of midwifery in Australia with a focus on the role of midwifery leadership and its potential to improve collaboration. A number of case studies report experiences and insights of leadership and collaboration across different contexts: clinical practice, organisation of health services and health policy leadership in maternity services. The result is a comprehensive understanding of the reasons for the lack of visibility of midwifery and the potential costs of such a situation continuing. The exploration of this situation highlights the barriers to recognising and acknowledging midwifery itself.  Attention is drawn to the continuing lack of voice and visible leadership in Australian midwifery, with midwives being absent from decision-making in situations whereothers, predominantly nurses and doctors, speak 'for' them. This work examines the barriers to midwives forming alliances and working to influence government agendas at the social, organisational and political level. Exploration of the power structures and hierarchical constraints that exist reveals particular barriers and highlights what is needed to address the impending decline of the profession in Australia. The enhanced capacity that midwives would experience if their work were to be understood, recognised and valued in the provision of maternity services in Australia, is postulated through the development of a construct called 'professional capital'. Drawing on several theoretical perspectives, it is argued that the notion of 'professional capital' is dependent on a strategy of focused and deliberate leadership and collaboration within maternity services and the creation of positive social networks and affiliations amongst midwives. Professional capital would enable greater visibility and recognition of midwifery and a more effective midwifery contribution to maternity services. It is suggested that improved professional and societal recognition will ultimately enhance the professional performance and self image of midwives. Such developments will enable new and effective ways of supporting and strengthening inter-professional relationships and systems of care that will, in the long term, improve the outcomes and experiences of women who access maternity services.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Practice</field><field name="subject">Professional Relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Continuously Variable Unit on Powertrain Dynamics</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis studies the dynamic model and simulation of a Half-Toroidal (HT) type Continuously Variable Unit (CVU) integrated into a conventional powertrain.  A simplified parametric model of a HT-CVU is constructed using Finite Element Method (FEM) in which the continuous variable speed unit is discretized into lumped masses, spring and damper elements. Linearized Finite Elements (FE) have been used to model the contacts between the toroids and rollers. The phenomenon of slip and spin associated with the rolling-slipping contacts of the traction drives are modelled kinematically. All Finite Elements including the CVU model are integrated into the complete powertrain system.  Free Vibration Analysis (FVA) of the multi degree of freedom system is carried out for torsional vibration for High Gear (HGR) and Low Gear Ratio (LGR) conditions. Further, FVA is carried out with a lock-up clutch engaged at high speed range. The results of the FVA indicates significant changes in natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes for both HGR and LGR condition with a change in HT-CVU gear ratios. Change in natural frequencies and mode shapes for both HGR and LGR conditions are also observed for varying contact torsional stiffness. The change is significant till a certain value of contact torsional stiffness. Further increase in contact torsional stiffness within the HT-CVU does not affect the natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes significantly. The results of the modal analysis carried out for a HT-CVU integrated powertrain with a lock-up clutch engaged at high speed range illustrates the ability of the lock-up clutch to simultaneously suspend engine and roller element excitation. However, for certain natural frequencies the modal analysis of the integrated powertrain system indicates suspension of engine and input toroid but increased excitation for the roller element of the HT-CVU.  The transient dynamic analysis is carried out to understand the behaviour of the CVU integrated into the complete powertrain and to identify and possibly correct potential problems associated with the system. The simulation is carried out for constant and variable throttle conditions for the powertrain with and without a lock up clutch engaged at high speed ranges. A piecewise curved gear ratio map is assumed for all conditions. All analyses are carried out for throttle 'tip-in' condition. The results of the transient dynamic analysis indicate that the transient responses of input and output rollers of the HT-CVU exist when clutch change occurs during vehicle acceleration period from stand still condition. The clutch change also leads to disturbances in the HT-CVU output torque to driveline and in vehicle speed. This leads to imperfect drive feel for the driver. The simulated vehicle velocity indicates powerful acceleration characteristics of the HT-CVU integrated powertrain. Engine harmonics is modelled as a rich collection of various forcing frequencies. These frequencies impress on the response of both the roller and output toroid and are observed in the simulation.  Stability analysis is carried out on the powertrain to understand the effect of damping in the tyres and damping within the HT-CVU on the stability of the powertrain. Severe or even unstable response of the HT-CVU takes place if the damping in the HT-CVU and/or the tyres is insufficient during the initial acceleration period and later after the clutch change occurs and when the vehicle is at high speeds. The results of the stability analysis lead us to reason with confidence that the tyre and HT-CVU damping have an effect on the dynamic characteristics and the stability of the system. The response of the powertrain becomes stable when a lock-up clutch is applied over the high speed ranges even if the damping in the tyres remains insufficient. The modal damping ratios for stable and unstable conditions are also discussed. Future investigations need to be carried out in order to understand in depth the fluid-metal interaction in the HT-CVU. This can be achieved by modelling in non-linear drag torque which would act on the HT-CVU elements.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automobiles</field><field name="subject">Transmission Devices</field><field name="subject">Automatic</field><field name="subject">Power Trains</field><field name="subject">Design and Construction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The right to leave and return and Chinese Migration Law</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The Right to leave and return (RLR) has been affirmed as a fundamental human right in several international instruments. While being a fundamental human right, each State has the sovereign right to regulate RLR in accordance with its own laws. The regulation of RLR, however, is not only an attribute of sovereignty but an issue with important political, economic and security implications for the State. Given its significance, it is understandable and desirable that States regulate RLR. The regulation must however take account of both the interests of the State and the human rights dimension of the right. This is an issue of balance. In the case of China, the country's communist political system has significantly affected the development of RLR and the country's approach to it. As a rule China's approach is restrictive. As part of its reform and 'opening up' policies, China has embarked on a range of reforms to liberalise RLR, but the reforms lack cohesion and focus, and remain restrictive. Given its peculiar past and complex social and economic conditions, China may have some justifications for its approach, but on balance, has more to gain from adopting a more liberal approach. The issue of RLR in China is crucial both for the future of China, and for development of RLR in the world.  China's current policy's on RLR still reflects a closed culture. A more open policy is not only consistent with international human rights norms, but also a useful infrastructure for the country's place in the global economy. Great achievements over the last 25 years and encouraging developmental trends demand acceleration of reforms to protect RLR in China. A careful and well-coordinated migration strategy with a well-defined RLR focus could enhance China's economic progress as well as its international human rights image. When designing the reform strategy, the balance of the Western experience and Chinese realities needs to be finely kept.  This thesis will explore the Chinese regulatory regime governing RLR to determine its consistency with international standards. The thesis is divided into 15 chapters. It investigates RLR in international migration law and practice; analyses RLR in the context of China, and identifies its driving factors; investigates the conditions and practical concerns relevant to the protection of RLR; and concludes with recommendations on how the Chinese regulatory regime governing RLR can be improved.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">immigration</field><field name="subject">freedom</field><field name="subject">movement</field><field name="subject">civil rights</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical relationships in waters and sediments of some urban streams, with particular reference to heavy metals and phosphorus</field><field name="creator">Hayes, Warwick Jay</field><field name="description">This thesis describes two studies of the chemistry of freshwater streams in the Sydney basin. The first was a survey of 86 waterways, sampled under low conditions. Samples were generally low in salinity, soft, of poor buffering capacity and dominated by sodium and chloride. C0-dominance by calcium, magnesium and (bi)carbonate occured in a number of particular cases. Multivariate analyses indicated three groups, separated primarily by levels of dissolved nutrients, trace metals, turbidity and colour. Groupings were associated strongly with the type of catchment. Streams in areas relatively unaffected by human influence had notable uniformity in chemistry, while those from developed catchments were varied. Heavy metal contamination was relatavely low, although a few of the samples displayed inordinately large levels of one or more metals. In such cases the more extreme measurements of phosphorus and nitrogen were also seen. The findings were consistant with occasional or localised elevation of contaminant levels. The second study invloved monitoring of three Hawkesbury Sandstone streams. Sampling of surface waters, interstial waters and sediments was performing at irregular intervals over a two year period at three stations within each site. The streams predominantly existed under low conditions and showed similar major ion chemistries to the majority of the survey samples. Levels of calcium and total carbonate, plus heavy metals and nutrients were generally higher in the urbanised creeks, comapred to the reference strema. During a heavy storm, high levels of nutrients, suspended solids and colour were detected in all surface waters at peak-flow, as well as alkaline pH, oxidising redox, and reduced conductivity, alkalinity and hardness. The sandy sediments were characterised by very low levels of organic matter and cation exchange capacity. Sequential extractions identified that the sums of secondary phase lead, zinc and copper were over nine, four and two times that of the corresponding residual, respectively. Greatest proportions of zinc and lead were associated with coatings of iron and maganese oxides, or coarse waste particles. Copper was preferentially associated with organic matter. Concentration gradients between interstitial and surface waters were rare and release of sedimentary constituents should occur from the upper-most particulates. Poor water and sediment qualities were often observed in the urban sites. Poor water quality was also seen on occassion in the reference stream. However, since poor sediment quality was not detected at those times and interstitial waters for all sites displayed high within-site variability, surface waters were considered the most reliable short-term indicator of condition for Hawkesbury Sandstone streams. Multidimensional scaling showed that all streams had distinct water and sediment chemistries. High levels of temporal and spatial variability were apparant within the urbanised sites - particularly in interstitial waters - mostly due to concentrations of heavy metals, phosphorus and suspended solids. Seasonal differences were detected, but only in terms of the level of variability between summer and winter samples.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trace elements.</field><field name="subject">Water.</field><field name="subject">Urban runoff.</field><field name="subject">Pollution.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the Internet on English language teaching: a case study at a Thai Rajabhat University.</field><field name="creator">Noytim, Usa</field><field name="description">This research was conducted in the English Department of a provincial Thai university. It seeks to address the tension between the priority accorded to English by the Thai government and the relatively low levels of English of most Thai people. The study investigates the potential of the Internet to support students&#8217; English language development, in particular the capacity of the Internet to support students&#8217; English reading development. The research was located in Central Thailand at Nakhon Pathom Rajabhat University (NPRU), my own work place. Here I investigated students&#8217; Internet practices and the potential offered by one English language program that incorporated use of the Internet. My focus on this one program enabled me to address questions about my own teaching practices, and about the implications of incorporating the Internet for program design and teaching. The research itself was conducted in two stages. Stage One was an ethnographic investigation of students&#8217; current Internet practices, both in and out of University. Outcomes from Stage One then informed the development of an English language program that incorporated extensive use of the Internet. This program was implemented and evaluated in Stage Two of the research. Outcomes from Stage One of the research revealed that the University students had low overall levels of Internet use, low levels of computer and Internet skills, but generally high levels of interest and enthusiasm, and a belief that the Internet could play a positive role in supporting English language learning. Outcomes from Stage Two confirmed that the Internet was potentially a powerful resource for teaching English. However, they also showed that if the Internet was incorporated fully into a program, rather than simply tacked onto a traditional program, then a major rethinking of program design and pedagogical practices was necessary. The implications of such changes in program design and teaching are addressed in the thesis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language.</field><field name="subject">Teaching.</field><field name="subject">Internet.</field><field name="subject">Thailand.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aesthetics and hyper/aesthetics: rethinking the senses in contemporary media contexts.</field><field name="creator">Swalwell, Melanie</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the escalation of interest in the senses, across a range of media technological contexts, dating from the mid 1990s. Much of this discourse has focussed on the experiential, particularly intense, multisensory experience of the present. As there are numerous discourses on the senses, technology and affect individually, my concern is to examine some of the intersections between these, in order to reconsider the contemporary significance of aesthetics in media contexts. I develop a &#8216;hyper/aesthetic&#8217; approach to try to think about aesthetic relations with technology in a nuanced way, opening up a space from which to investigate a variety of relations with technology. Walter Benjamin&#8217;s work on the senses and modern technology is useful in this, as is that of two of his commentators, Susan BuckMorss and Miriam Hansen. In providing the outlines of a hyper/aesthetic approach in this thesis, I am, in particular, seeking to complexify understandings of audience reception and meaningmaking, to return some ambivalence to conceptions of the sensory encounter with technology. Hyper/aesthetics is a term that draws together ambivalence, doubling, virtuality, unfamiliarity, innervation, and moving beyond, all concepts that are relevant to the senses and subjectivity. In close readings of case studies drawn from the areas of advertising, computer gaming practices, and new media art, I argue that as well as critiquing their claims to newness, it is also important to attend to the ways in which particular relations with technology exceed or refuse the logic of instrumentality. In particular, these cases consider the emerging aesthetic experiences that technologies of computer gaming and new media art facilitate, and the new subjective possibilities that follow from each. Approaching these studies hyper/aesthetically enables me to go beyond other accounts in appreciating the more experimental character of some of these relations with technology. I particularly focus on the effects and affects generated by encounters with the unfamiliar, including that which is considered strange, &#8216;unnatural&#8217; or &#8216;inhuman&#8217;, and critically appraise the significance of encounters such as these for the manner in which subjectivity is conceived.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aesthetics.</field><field name="subject">Senses.</field><field name="subject">Technology.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technologies transforming academics: academic identity and online teaching.</field><field name="creator">McShane, Kim</field><field name="description">As the discourses of the &#8220;technological imperative&#8221; and student-centred learning have gained momentum in university teaching and learning, one way for the lecturer to signal excellence has been to adopt the flexible, student-centred practices of online teaching. This thesis investigates academics&#8217; insights and experiences about their changing teacher identities in the context of being, or becoming, a facilitator of online student learning. This was an empirical research project, a collective case study that explored the teaching experiences of twelve university lecturers in two Australian universities who taught online, or were making the move online. Primary research data were drawn from semi-structured conversations with the lecturers, online teaching artefacts and email communications. The interpretative analysis was organised according to three overlapping lecturer identities: the teaching metaphors of performance, care and creative direction. From the perspective of each metaphor position, the move to becoming a facilitator of blended learning was uneasy. The performer/carer/director lecturer struggled to entertain, care and intervene in familiar ways in asynchronous, computer-mediated communication. Online, the performing/caring/directing lecturer was ignored by students, and became instead a helpless and highly reflexive bystander to students&#8217; learning. The findings suggest that the teaching values and practices of the performing/caring/directing lecturer, in particular lecturer-student responsiveness and reciprocity, do not adapt to online pedagogies. Indeed, blended learning establishes the conditions for a new moral order in university education, with the move to online facilitation best understood as a move to management-centred regulation of teaching and student learning. And so, overlooked in higher education policy and research, and ignored by her students online, the performing/caring/directing lecturer is under erasure, at the same time as the work of the facilitator is being archived.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet.</field><field name="subject">Academics.</field><field name="subject">Teaching.</field><field name="subject">Lecturer.</field><field name="subject">Technology.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scalable and cost-effective framework for continuous media-on-demand.</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Dang Nam Chi</field><field name="description">This dissertation was motivated by the exponential growth in bandwidth capacity of the Internet, coupled with the immense growth of broadband adoption by the public. This has led to the development of a wide variety of new online services. Chief amongst the emerging applications is the delivery of multimedia contents to the end users via the network on-demand. It is the &#8220;on-demand&#8221; aspect that has led to problems which, despite the advances in hardware technology and network capacity, have hampered wide scale adoption of multimedia delivery. The focus of this dissertation was to address these problems, namely: scalability, cost-effectiveness, and network quality of service for timely presentation of multimedia contents. We proposed an architecture, which we referred to as &#8220;Delayed-Multicast&#8221;, to address the scalability problem. The new architecture introduced buffers within the network to reduce demands on core network bandwidth and server load. A feasibility study of the architecture was conducted through the use of a prototype. It was found that such a system is within reach by demonstrating the prototype using cheap, common-of-the-shelf (COTS) components, and with help of freely available system software such Linux with real-time support. The introduction of buffers within the network led to the requirement of how to minimize buffer space. We developed an optimal algorithm for allocating buffer space in a single level caching layout (i.e. only one buffer in the transmission path from the server to the end user). For the case of multi-levels network caching, we thoroughly examined different optimization problems from an algorithmic perspective. These problems included how to minimize total system memory, and minimize the maximum memory used per node. We proved that determining the optimal buffer allocation in many of these iv v cases is an NP-complete problem. Consequently, we developed heuristics to handle multi-level caching and showed through simulations that the heuristics greatly help in minimizing buffer space and network bandwidth requirement. An important aspect of the heuristics was how to handle the case when the arrival times of client requests were not known a priori. For these &#8220;online&#8221; problems we also proposed heuristics that can significantly reduce overall system resource requirements. If the cost of buffer space was also taken into account along with the cost of network bandwidth, a different optimization problem was how to minimize the total system cost. Here, we also proposed heuristics, which in simulations show that the total system cost can be significantly reduced. Besides the problems associated with resource allocation, in terms of buffer space and bandwidth, we also examined the problem of how to provision the necessary network quality of service on-demand. Most current networks rely on best-effort delivery which is ill suited for the delivery of multimedia traffic. We proposed a solution which relied on the use of a programmable network plane, that is present in many current routers, to dynamically alter the priority of flows within the network in real-time. We also demonstrated the effectiveness of the flow prioritization on an actual Nortel router. Finally, we examined the problem of how to admit and achieve fair bandwidth allocation for the end-users within a Differentiated Service (DiffServ) network. Diff- Serv is an IETF standard that aims to provide a &#8220;better than best-effort&#8221; network in a scalable manner, and is used widely, especially within the same autonomous domain for prioritization different classes of traffic. However, there are open problems on how to provide fair bandwidth allocation amongst competing flows. We proposed an edge-aware resource discovery loop, which as the name suggests, sent packets to gather information about the internal states of the core network. With this information, we proposed a price-based admission control algorithm for use within the DiffServ network that would allow fair admission, effective congestion control, and fair bandwidth allocation amongst different traffic flows.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Streaming.</field><field name="subject">Technology.</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication.</field><field name="subject">Data transmission.</field><field name="subject">Interactive.</field><field name="subject">Multimedia.</field><field name="subject">Bandwidth.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corpus modificatus: transmutational belonging and posthuman becoming.</field><field name="creator">Massie, Raya</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

This is a
fundamental question to be addressed in capitalist production, since material production takes
place privately and independently in a global and atomistic system. This thesis shows that the
question is tackled by Marx in the first three chapters of Capital. The process of social
recognition of material production is that of the realisation of work carried out privately and
independently as part of the social labour. For Marx this occurs through the private and
independent work becoming objective social labour as the substance of the value of
commodities, and through the latter finding its necessary developed mercantile expression in
the price form of commodities. Therefore, private and independent work becomes social
labour through the recognition of its product as equivalent to a certain amount of money.
The thesis argues that Marx&#146;s answer is powerfully insightful but flawed because it did not
succeed in fully characterising the historical specificity of commodity. Commodity is not
merely the differentiated unity of use value and value but of use value and mercantile use
value, and of labour value and mercantile value. The former dialectic is immediate and
distinguishes between the utility of commodity as a direct means of consumption or
production and that as a means of exchange, fully determining the behaviour of the private
and independent commodity producer. The latter dialectic is objective and distinguishes
between commodity as the embodiment of the social labour necessary to reproduce it and as the embodiment of command over social labour, enabling the adjustment of the productive
structure. Both dialectics are mediated by the mercantile form of value, which allows the
indirect expression of labour value as the gravitational force of the system. The theory of
commodity offered in this thesis, unlike that of Marx, consistently hinges on the atomistic
private and independent commodity producer.
The thesis shows that commodity production is the organisation of society&#146;s labour for its
material reproduction, just as in any previous mode of production. The discovery of the
generic aspect of commodity production breaks the false immediate link between production
and supply, and that between the labour theory of value and both the supply-side-determined
theory of price and the single-factor theory of production. The thesis also shows that the
mercantile form of value is what allows society&#146;s labour to become an objective and
autonomous materially abstract substance regulating the adjustment of the productive system
under the form of material signals. This is the specific aspect of a global mode of production
comprised of free and independent individuals. The mercantile form of value is thus Adam
Smith&#146;s invisible hand.
Finally, the thesis analyses some implications of the framework with regard to the analysis of
monetary phenomena, capital accumulation and sustainable development, and reviews the
most popular Marxian topic in Economics: the transformation of values into prices of
production.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">commodity</field><field name="subject">money</field><field name="subject">form of value</field><field name="subject">exchange value</field><field name="subject">labour value</field><field name="subject">mercantile value</field><field name="subject">use value</field><field name="subject">mercantile use value</field><field name="subject">comparative advantage</field><field name="subject">Marx</field><field name="subject">material production</field><field name="subject">invisible hand</field><field name="subject">dialectic</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080319.150942/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of past and future vegetation change for the lizard fauna of Motunau Island</field><field name="creator">Bannock, Carol A.</field><field name="description">Abundance, distribution and habitat preferences of the lizard species present on Motunau Island, off the Canterbury coast of New Zealand, were investigated. The aim of the study was to investigate the extent to which recent vegetation change on Motunau Island has effected the lizard community and what implications this has for the future management of the Island. Three species of lizard occur on Motunau Island; the common gecko (Hoplodactylus maculatus), common skink (Oligosoma nigriplantare polychroma) and spotted skink (O. lineoocellatum). Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were present on the island from 1862 until their eradication in 1962. Since then, vegetation on the island has changed from being tussock-dominated to being dominated by exotic weeds. Data from lizard pitfall trap surveys carried out in 1967-75 by Tony Whitaker of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) were compared with new pitfall trapping data to determine if changes in the lizard population had occurred in response to these vegetation changes. The abundance of O. n. polychroma and H. maculatus does not appear to change significantly. The distribution of these two species were significantly correlated but neither showed any preference for a particular type. The abundance of O. lineoocellatum was significantly greater in 1996/97 than in the earlier DSlR surveys. This could be a result of the vegetation becoming more open and more structurally complex since the early surveys. This would offer greater opportunities for O. lineoocellatum (which is strongly heliothermic) to thermoregulate and forage. O. lineoocellatum showed no consistent significant preference towards any habitat type, although they tended to be found more in 'margin' habitat. Research into pitfall trapping and the way lizard behaviour may influence pitfall trapping data needs to be undertaken as there is a possible trap bias in this study. Management of Motunau Island needs to ensure that a structurally complex environment is maintained to ensure high numbers of all three lizard species can continue to coexist.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">common gecko</field><field name="subject">Hoplodactylus maculatus</field><field name="subject">common skink</field><field name="subject">Oligosoma nigriplantare polychroma</field><field name="subject">spotted skink</field><field name="subject">Oligosoma lineoocellafum</field><field name="subject">Motunau Island</field><field name="subject">vegetation change</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080430.163408/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Energy use in the New Zealand tourism sector</field><field name="creator">Becken, Susanne</field><field name="description">Energy use associated with tourism has rarely been studied, despite a potentially considerable contribution to global or national energy demand and concomitant greenhouse gas emissions. In New Zealand, tourism constitutes an increasingly important economic sector that is supported by the Government to induce further economic growth. At the same time New Zealand is facing the challenge of reducing currently increasing fossil fuel combustion and carbon dioxide emissions. As a response, this study investigated the contribution tourism makes to energy use in New Zealand. In particular it has examined the role of the three main tourism subsectors (transport, accommodation, and attractions/activities), and different domestic and international 'tourist types'. Seven separate data analyses provided inputs for building a model based on 'tourist types' from which energy use in the New Zealand tourism sector could be estimated. Tourism was found to contribute at least 5.6% to national energy demand, which is larger than its 4.9% contribution to GDP in 2000. Transport, in particular domestic air and car travel, was identified as the dominant energy consumer. Within the accommodation sub-sector, hotels are the largest energy consumers, both in total and on a per visitor-night basis. Of the three sub-sectors, attractions and activities contribute least to energy use, however, activities such as scenic flights or boat cruises were recognised as being energy intensive. As a result of larger visitor volumes, domestic tourists contribute more to energy consumption than international tourists. Domestic and international tourists types differ in their energy consumption patterns, for example measured as energy use per travel day. Tourist types that rely on air travel are the most energy intensive ones, for example the domestic 'long air business' travellers or the international 'coach tourists'. The importance of international tourists' energy use will increase, given current growth rates. There are many options to decrease energy use of the tourism sector, with the most effective ones being within the energy intensive transport sub-sector. Increasing vehicle efficiencies and decreasing travel distances appear to be the most promising measures. This study argues that energy use depends largely on tourists' travel behaviour. Changing behaviour is possible but is postulated to be very difficult, and further research is needed to better understand tourists' motivations, expectations and decision-making. Only then, can strategies be developed and implemented to alter travel behaviours to better balance energy use, other environmental impacts and economic yield. Such a balance is a crucial consideration in the search for more sustainable forms of tourism.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainable tourism</field><field name="subject">energy use</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">tourist types</field><field name="subject">tourist behaviour</field><field name="subject">transport</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080430.132639/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of home ranges, movements, diet and habitat use of kereru (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae) in the southeastern sector of Banks Peninsula, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Kirsten L.</field><field name="description">The present study is part of the Kaupapa Kereru Programme. The main aim of the programme is to increase the numbers and range of kereru (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae) on Banks Peninsula. Home ranges, movements, diet and habitat use of 15 kereru captured in Hinewai Reserve, Banks Peninsula, were investigated from February 2005 to February 2006. Hinewai Reserve is the largest tract of regenerating native forest in a highly modified urban-rural landscape. Phenology of 11 plant species predicted to be key kereru foods, was studied to determine the pattern of food availability in Hinewai Reserve. Twelve radio-tagged kereru resided in the Hinewai Reserve study site (Otanerito Valley and Sleepy Bay) and three resided in Akaroa. Ripe fruit was available from January to August; the height of the fruiting season was in autumn. The bulk of new leaf growth occurred in spring and early summer although new leaves were available on broom and tree lucerne year round. Peak flowering occurred in spring. Kereru in Akaroa ate a total of 21 plant species; six of these species were native and 15 introduced. Kereru in the Hinewai Reserve study site ate a total of 26 plant species; 20 of these species were native and six introduced. Fruit was preferred when readily available. Native fruit appeared to be preferred over fruit of introduced species in Akaroa, where both types were available. New foliage of introduced legumes and deciduous species appeared to be preferred over new foliage of native species at both sites during winter and spring. These species were important food sources prior to the breeding season and may be selected specifically for their nitrogen and protein content. Food is currently not a limiting factor for kereru survival or reproductive success. Considerable variation in the use and preference of vegetation types of individual kereru made it difficult to identify trends in habitat selection. Use and preference for many vegetation types was seasonal; this was certainly because of the availability of food species included in or close to these vegetation types. Overall, native vegetation communities were used more than communities dominated by introduced species and forest communities were used more than non-forest communities. Kanuka (Kunzea ericoides) was used most often for non-feeding activities and 67% of observed nests were built in kanuka. Annual home ranges and core areas in the Hinewai Reserve study site (mean of 15.9 and 2 ha respectively) were significantly larger than those found in Lyttelton Harbour, Banks Peninsula in previous research (mean of 8 and 0.08 ha respectively). Home ranges were larger when fruit was eaten, than when no fruit was eaten indicating that kereru are more sedentary when feeding on foliage. Kereru from the Hinewai Reserve study site made no excursions &gt;5 km and no daily movements &gt;2 km. Kereru from Akaroa and Sleepy Bay travelled into Otanerito Valley to feed on horopito in autumn, indicating that there may have been a lack of fruit in their local areas during autumn. No kereru in Otanerito Valley travelled outside of the valley. The distribution of high quality food sources is likely to have caused the observed differences in home range and core area size between localities. Kereru in Lyttelton Harbour may have been restricted to small patches of high quality resources in a study area consisting largely of unsuitable habitat. In Hinewai Reserve, high quality resources were spread over larger areas and were more uniformly distributed. The density of kereru was unknown at both study sites, and this confounded assessment of habitat quality. However, it is likely that the Hinewai Reserve study site would support a higher number of kereru. The main factor limiting population growth in the present study was failure of nests at the egg and chick stage. The fledge rate was 17%. Two of fifteen adult kereru died. Control of predators should be the first aspect of management that is focused on, and will almost certainly increase reproductive success of kereru and loss of breeding adults. As the population of kereru on Banks Peninsula increases due to predator control in existing kereru habitat, food may become a limiting factor. Habitat can be improved for kereru by planting a diverse range of plant species that provide food year-round. Native fruiting species are greatly recommended for habitat enhancement and should be selected so that fruit is available for as much of the year as possible. Native and introduced legumes should also be made available as foods for winter and spring. As most land on Banks Peninsula is privately owned, co-operation and enthusiasm of the community is critical for successful management. Information and support needs to be given to landowners wishing to enhance their properties for kereru.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kereru</field><field name="subject">Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae</field><field name="subject">Banks Peninsula</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080317.131118/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between shoot and root growth of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) plants under various environmental stresses</field><field name="creator">Chung, G. C.</field><field name="description">The response of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) plants to various root and shoot environments (solution depth, temperature, ionic strength, nitrogen and calcium level and light intensity) were studied. Cucumber plants were grown in continuously circulating-solution in a heated-glasshouse. Dry weights of leaves, stems and roots, leaf area, leaf number, root length and root number were measured as well as uptake of potassium, calcium and nitrogen. The relationship between shoot and root in terms of functional equilibrium equations was also examined. The results presented show that: 1. Shoot growth of cucumber plants was reduced if grown in solutions of less than 50mm in depth; 2. When roots were grown in shallow solution depths at 1 or 5mm the dry weight allocated to the root increased. The ratio of root number/root length(no./cm) also increased. Lowering solution temperature to 12.5&#177;2.5&#176;C enhanced the production of root number relctive to root length, and 5 and 2% of full strength and 5% of full strength nitrogen level solution stimulated the growth of root length relative to root number; 3. Under low solution temperature treatment leaf number was maintained at the expense of leaf area. Under low total ionic strength and low nitrogen solution, enhanced root length growth was at the expense of leaf area growth; 4. Low solution temperature enhanced the dry weight allocated to the stem relative to the leaf. Low total ionic strength and low nitrogen solution increased the dry weight allocated to the leaf relative to the stem; 5. The specific activity of root, represented by specific absorption rate, increased when the shoot was under light stress and, the specific activity of shoot, represented by unit shoot rate, increased when the root was under nitrogen-stress; 6. The form of equation developed by Thornley (&#916;M = fm&#916;W, where &#916;M is the increment in weight of element M and &#916;W the increment in total plant dry weight during a time period &#916;t with fm a constant) showed a better relationship than the equation developed by Davidson [root mass x rate(absorption) &#8733; leaf mass x rate(photosynthesis)] and subsequently used by Hunt in the form of mass ratio(root/shoot) &#8733; l/activity ratio; 7. The equation developed by Chung et al, total plant weight/(leaf number/leaf area) &#8733; total "k"/(root number/root length), where k represents the total contents of elements or compounds, showed a good approximation of the relationship between shoot and root under all the environmental stresses imposed with the exception of calcium uptake. The results support the concept that the activity of the root or shoot in carrying out its function is influenced by the demand created by the opposite organ and appears to be a better assumption than that which proposes that the activity of an organ is solely dependent on its own size.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.); solution depth; solution temperature; ionic strength; light intensity; nitrogen and calcium level; shoot; root; morphology; functional equilibrium equations; nutrient film technique</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080220.103902/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two decades of vegetation change across tussock grasslands in New Zealand's South Island</field><field name="creator">Day, Nicola J.</field><field name="description">New Zealand's South Island tussock grasslands have been highly modified by human activities, including burning, grazing and introductions of exotic plants for pastoralism. Studies suggest that tussock grasslands are degraded, in that native species have declined, and exotic species have increased in both diversity and abundance. These trends are primarily thought to be related to the impacts of grazing and subsequent grazing removal. Few studies have assessed long-term changes that have occurred in tussock grasslands, and those that have are generally limited to one particular location. This thesis aimed to investigate temporal changes in community structure in tussock grasslands, and relate these changes to environmental variables and land tenure. Data were used from 90 permanently-marked vegetation transects, which were set up on 19 geographically widespread properties in areas of tussock grassland across Canterbury and Otago in the South Island of New Zealand. The transects were on land in both conservation and pastoral tenure. Each transect was 100 m, and consisted of 50 0.25 m&#178; quadrats. The transects were measured between 1982 and 1986 (first measurement), were re-measured between 1993 and 1999 (second measurement) and again between 2005 and 2006 (third measurement). A total of 347 vascular species were observed over the 90 transects and three measurement times. Species richness declined between the first and second measurements (first time interval), and increased between the second and third measurements (second time interval), at both the small (quadrat) and large (transect) scales. Both native and exotic species declined in mean quadrat species richness during the first time interval, and then increased during the second time interval. Changes in mean quadrat species richness were similar on transects in both conservation and pastoral tenure. Multivariate analysis of species' occurrences in quadrats identified a long gradient in species composition for these 90 transects. Four key plant communities were identifed along this gradient and differed in their mean elevation: (1) Highly-modified pastoral community, (2) Short-tussock grassland community, (3) Tall-tussock grassland community, (4) Alpine mat-forming species community. A detailed investigation into temporal changes that occurred on 53 transects that occurred in short- and tall-tussock grassland communities showed that changes in species composition were not consistent over time. Transects on different properties changed in species composition by different amounts. Specifically, in ordination space, transects on two properties changed in composition significantly more than transects on one other property. The property that a transect was on also affected the way that it changed in composition, i.e. native species were more likely to have increased on transects on some properties. Transects in conservation tenure did not change in species richness or composition differently from those in pastoral tenure. Considering that many native plants in tussock grasslands are relatively slow-growing, and that these areas have been grazed and burned for more than a century, we may expect it to be some time before we can detect differences in vegetation dynamics on conservation land from that on pastoral land. The changes in the community structure of these tussock grasslands were related to a combination of environmental factors, such as soil chemistry, climate, and management factors. This study has allowed greater understanding of vegetation change in tussock grasslands, and demonstrates the importance of long-term ecological monitoring in making reliable and accurate predictions about landscape-scale changes in tussock grassland community structure.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vegetation change</field><field name="subject">plant species richness</field><field name="subject">plant species composition</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">tenure</field><field name="subject">Hieracium spp.</field><field name="subject">Chionochloa spp.</field><field name="subject">tussock grasslands</field><field name="subject">vegetation monitoring</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080304.145252/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using web services for customised data entry</field><field name="creator">Deng, Yanbo</field><field name="description">Scientific databases often need to be accessed from a variety of different applications. There are usually many ways to retrieve and analyse data already in a database. However, it can be more difficult to enter data which has originally been stored in different sources and formats (e.g. spreadsheets, other databases, statistical packages). 

This project focuses on investigating a generic, platform independent way to simplify the loading of databases. The proposed solution uses Web services as middleware to supply essential data management functionality such as inserting, updating, deleting and retrieval of data. These functions allow application developers to easily customise their own data entry applications according to local data sources, formats and user requirements. 

We implemented a Web service to support loading data to the Germinate database at the New Zealand Institute of Crop &amp; Food Research (CFR). We also provided language specific client toolkits to help developers invoke the Web service. The toolkits allow applications to be easily customised for different platforms. In addition, we developed sample applications to help end users load data from their project data sources via the Web service.

The Web service approach was evaluated through user and developer trials. The feedback from the developer trial showed that using Web services as middleware is a useful approach to allow developers and competent end users to customise data entry with minimal effort. More importantly, the customised client applications enabled end users to load data directly from their project spreadsheets and databases. It significantly reduced the effort required for exporting or transforming the source data.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">data integration</field><field name="subject">data management</field><field name="subject">data loading</field><field name="subject">web services</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080313.185408/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-involvement work systems : their effect on employee turnover and organisational performance in New Zealand organisations</field><field name="creator">Doody, Sarah-Jane Patricia</field><field name="description">Organisations can create a competitive advantage through the way they design their human resource systems.  High involvement work systems are considered to be a way to increase organisational performance and decrease employee turnover.  However, the components involved are difficult and complex to define, and the synergy amongst the different components hard to evaluate. The literature suggests that the research is not uniform in its approach, and most research does not clearly define the variables involved or agree on the expected results of such systems.

This research looks at high involvement work systems in the New Zealand organisational context, and relating these systems to employee turnover and organisational performance.  The results of the study suggest that there does not appears to be a relationship between high involvement work systems, and employee turnover and organisational performance; but high involvement systems may contribute to increased labour productivity in New Zealand organisations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high involvement work systems</field><field name="subject">high performance work practices</field><field name="subject">employee turnover</field><field name="subject">organisational performance</field><field name="subject">labour productivity</field><field name="subject">New Zealand organisations</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080125.192821/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of shading and crop load on flavour and aroma compounds in Sauvignon blanc grapes and wine</field><field name="creator">Ford, Rebecca Jane</field><field name="description">The effects of crop load and berry exposure on the composition of Marlborough Sauvignon blanc grapes and wine from the Brancott vineyard, Blenheim, were explored.
Commercially grown, 2-cane and 4-cane Sauvignon blanc vines were used with a row orientation of north-south. Two exposure treatments were imposed in the following manner: complete leaf removal was undertaken in the fruit zone and 50% shade cloth was erected to give a uniform shading treatment to half the trial vines. Weekly thirty-berry and whole bunch samples were taken from each of the 32 plots with the exception of the veraison period when two samples per week were taken. Vine vigour was assessed using pruning and leaf area per vine data. Harvest occurred on different dates for 2-cane and 4-cane pruned vines so that fruit attained from both treatments had similar &#176;Brix. Fruit was processed at the Lincoln University winery. Must analysis and wine analysis were
undertaken. As expected, 4-cane vines had almost double the yield of 2-cane vines. Higher crop load
significantly reduced leaf area per shoot and shoot thickness. Lower leaf area to fruit ratio
for 4-cane berries resulted in delayed onset of veraison and slowed the rate of sugar accumulation. Crop load, which limited leaf area to fruit ratio, appeared to be the dominant
factor in determining timing of grape physiological ripeness as expressed by &#176;Brix over
other factors such as fruit exposure. Malic acid, tartaric acid, IPMP (iso-propylmethoxypyrazine)
and IBMP (iso-butyl-methoxypyrazine) were lower at equivalent &#176;Brix in 4-cane compared with 2-cane berries. Significantly higher concentrations of quercetin were found in exposed compared to shaded berries. Must analysis showed a significant influence of crop load on berry titratable acidity and pH, reflecting berry ripening results. Exposure significantly increased the concentrations of nitrogenous compounds in 4-cane must yet showed no influence on 2-cane must.
After wine processing lower malic acid concentrations in wines made from 100% exposed
fruit became evident in lower wine titratable acidity but showed no influence on wine pH.
Bentonite addition to wines had a small but statistically significant influence on wine by
reducing pH, titratable acidity and alcohol. Bound sulphur concentrations were significantly
higher in 4-cane versus 2-cane wines. At harvest, methoxypyrazine levels in grapes and wines were very low; IBMP concentrations where significantly lower than those normally found in Sauvignon blanc wines from Marlborough. This was attributed to the absence of basal leaves from the shoots of ripening berries.

The results suggest that leaf area to fruit ratio is a powerful determinant of grape and wine
quality.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sauvignon blanc</field><field name="subject">crop load</field><field name="subject">exposure</field><field name="subject">leaf area</field><field name="subject">canopy structure</field><field name="subject">quercetin</field><field name="subject">methoxypyrazines</field><field name="subject">thiols</field><field name="subject">&#176;Brix</field><field name="subject">organic acids</field><field name="subject">sulphur dioxide</field><field name="subject">bentonite</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080523.100013/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An ecological study of the lizard fauna of Kaitorete Spit, Canterbury</field><field name="creator">Freeman, A. B.</field><field name="description">Baited pitfall traps were used to sample the lizard fauna at Birdlings Flat on Kaitorete Spit, Canterbury. Four species had been recorded previously from this area; Leiolopisma maccanni Patterson and Daugherty, Leiolopisma nigriplantare polychroma Patterson and Daugherty, Leiolopisma lineoocellatum (Dumeril and Dumeril) and Hoplodactylus maculatus (Gray). Three of these species (L. maccanni, L. n. polychroma and H. maculatus) were captured during the course of the study. The aim of this present study was to examine the nature of the ecological relationship among these three species at Birdlings Flat. Capture data indicated that L. maccanni was almost entirely confined to the dunelands while L. n. polychroma was associated exclusively with shrublands on old dune ridges behind the sand dunes. H. maculatus' distribution encompassed both of these major habitats. Separation on the basis of habitat was thought to be the most important niche variable for these two diurnal skinks. There was some temporal separation in activity of these two species, with L. maccanni active earlier in the day than L. n. polychroma. However, there was a high degree of overlap in the activity periods of these two species. Temporal differentiation between the nocturnal gecko H. maculatus and the two diurnal skinks is thought to be an important means by which these species coexist. The most common prey items consumed by all three species were Diptera, Araneae, C. propinqua seeds, Hemiptera, unidentified arthropod eggs, Coleoptera and Hymenoptera. Dietary differences between the two skink species were apparent although these differences appeared to be related to the preferred habitats of the respective species. Density estimates for L. maccanni varied between 1050/ha and 1850/ha while L. n. polychroma density varied between 200/ha and 400/ha. The density of H. maculatus was not calculated but appeared to be intermediate to the density of the two skink species. The apparent disappearance of L. lineoocellatum from an area where they were once relatively common is cause for concern. There is no obvious reason for this decline although it may be related to the combined impacts of predation, collection and habitat disturbance.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lizards</field><field name="subject">skinks</field><field name="subject">geckos</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">Canterbury</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080205.115012/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of fisheries waste in the diet of Westland Petrels (Procellaria westlandica)</field><field name="creator">Freeman, A. N. D.</field><field name="description">Westland petrels Procellaria westlandica breed only near Punakaiki on the West Coast
of New Zealand. About 80 km offshore from their breeding colony, New Zealand's largest commercial fishery (for hoki Macruronus novaezelandiae) operates from mid June to early September, coinciding with the Westland petrel's breeding season.
It has been assumed that Westland petrels feed extensively on fisheries waste and that
this habit has been at least partly responsible for the increase in the Westland petrel
population. Some seabird biologists have expressed concern that if a species comes to
depend on scavenging at fishing vessels, such a species could experience a food crisis if
fishing operations changed in a way that reduced the quantity of waste discharged. The aim of this research was to assess how dependent Westland petrels have become on fisheries waste for food.
Diet studies showed that during the hoki fishing season, waste accounts for more than half by weight of the solid food Westland petrels bring back to the colony to feed their chicks. After the hoki season, waste contributes only about a quarter of their diet as birds switch to more natural prey and scavenge a wider variety of fish species presumably from smaller, inshore fishing vessels.
Much of the fisheries waste eaten by Westland petrels was flesh which could not be identified using traditional techniques. The electrophoretic technique iso-electric focusing increased the number of fish samples that could be identified and consequently the diet was interpreted differently than it would have been had only traditional diet analysis been used.
The survey of Westland petrel distribution off the west coast of the South Island, found
that although hoki fishing vessels influence the distribution of Westland petrels, only a small proportion of the Westland petrel population appears to utilise this food resource at any one time.
Westland petrels were tracked at sea by VHF radio telemetry and then by satellite tracking. Satellite tracking showed that there is considerable variation in the amount of
time Westland petrels spend in the vicinity of fishing vessels. On average, satellite tracked birds spent one third of their time near vessels, but they foraged over much larger areas than that occupied by the West Coast South Island hoki fishing fleet.
Although fisheries waste is an important component of the Westland petrel diet, it appears that the situation is one of opportunistic use of a readily available resource, rather than one of dependence. Several features of the Westland petrel's breeding biology and foraging ecology suggest that Westland petrels could compensate for a reduction in waste from the hoki fishery by switching to other sources of waste and
increasing their consumption of natural prey.
Nevertheless, much remains unanswered concerning the role of fisheries waste in the Westland petrel's diet. In particular, quantifying the waste available to seabirds, and the
success of Westland petrels in acquiring that waste compared to other scavenging species, is needed in order to better predict the effect of a reduction in fisheries waste on Westland petrel population size.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Westland petrel</field><field name="subject">Procellaria westlandica</field><field name="subject">hoki</field><field name="subject">Macruronus novaezelandiae</field><field name="subject">fisheries waste</field><field name="subject">diet</field><field name="subject">population</field><field name="subject">distribution</field><field name="subject">iso-electric focusing</field><field name="subject">satellite tracking</field><field name="subject">Geographical Information System</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080219.145454/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinants of the introduction, naturalisation, and spread of Trifolium species in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gravuer, Kelly</field><field name="description">Two conceptual approaches which offer promise for improved understanding of biological invasions are conceptualizing the invasion process as a series of distinct stages and explicitly incorporating human actions into analyses.  This study explores the utility of these approaches for understanding the invasion of Trifolium (true clover) species in New Zealand.  From the published literature, I collected a range of Trifolium species attributes, including aspects of global transport and use by humans, opportunistic association with humans in New Zealand, native range attributes, habitat characteristics, and biological traits.  I also searched historical records to estimate the extent to which each species had been planted in New Zealand, a search facilitated by the enormous importance of Trifolium in New Zealand&#146;s pastoral agriculture system.  Regression analysis and structural equation modelling were then used to relate these variables to success at each invasion stage.  Fifty-four of the 228 species in the genus Trifolium were intentionally introduced to New Zealand.  Species introduced for commercial agriculture were characterised by a large number of economic uses and presence in Britain, while species introduced for horticulture or experimental agriculture were characterised by a large native range area.  Nine of these 54 intentionally introduced species subsequently naturalised in New Zealand.  The species that successfully naturalised were those that had been planted extensively by humans and that were well-matched to the New Zealand climate.  A further 16 species (from the pool of 174 species that were never intentionally introduced) arrived and naturalised in New Zealand without any recorded intentional aid of humans.  Several attributes appeared to assist species in unintentional introduction-naturalisation, including a good match to the New Zealand climate, a large native range area, presence in human-influenced habitats, a widespread distribution in Britain, and self-pollination capability.  The 25 total naturalised species varied greatly in their current distributions and in the rates at which they had spread to achieve those distributions.  Species that had spread quickly and are currently more widespread had been frequent contaminants in the pasture seed supply and have a long flowering period in New Zealand.  Other biological traits and native range attributes played supporting roles in the spread process.  Attributes facilitating success clearly varied among invasion stages.  Humans played a dominant role at all stages of this invasion, although biological traits had increasing importance as a species moved through the invasion sequence.  My findings suggest that incorporation of human actions and the stage-based framework provide valuable insight into the invasion process.  I discuss potential avenues by which these approaches might be integrated into predictive invasion models.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">invasive</field><field name="subject">alien</field><field name="subject">exotic</field><field name="subject">non-indigenous</field><field name="subject">introduced species</field><field name="subject">plant</field><field name="subject">stage</field><field name="subject">transition</field><field name="subject">stage-specific framework</field><field name="subject">experimental trials</field><field name="subject">introduction</field><field name="subject">naturalisation</field><field name="subject">spread</field><field name="subject">Trifolium</field><field name="subject">clover</field><field name="subject">human agency</field><field name="subject">human dispersal</field><field name="subject">introduction effort</field><field name="subject">unintentional</field><field name="subject">deliberate</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20071015.060329/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimates of the nutritional cost of the development of immunity to gastrointestinal parasites in sheep</field><field name="creator">Greer, Andrew Walter</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a series of three experiments designed to estimate the nutritional cost of the immune response to the gastrointestinal nematodes Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Teladorsagia circumcincta in sheep.  For each experiment, animals were allocated hierarchically by liveweight into one of four groups that were either infected (group IF), similarly infected and concurrently immuno-suppressed with weekly intramuscular injections of 1.3mg kg liveweight (LW)-1 of methylprednisolone acetate (group ISIF), immuno-suppressed only (group IS) or remained as controls (group C).  Body composition of all animals was estimated using x-ray computer tomography prior to infection and at the conclusion of each study with bodyweight and faecal nematode egg counts (FEC; eggs gram-1 of fresh faeces (epg)) measured along with blood samples taken for the determination of levels of serum proteins, phosphate and antibodies.  
   
In the first trial (Chapter 3), the nutritional cost of both the acquisition and maintenance of immunity to gastro-intestinal nematodes was investigated using immunologically naive 5-month-old lambs and immunologically competent 17-month-old ewes during infection with 2,000 and 4,000 L3 infective T. colubriformis larvae d-1, respectively (80 L3 T. colubriformis larvae kgLW-1 d-1).  Profiles of FEC and comparative worm burdens at slaughter indicated an effective immune response was maintained in IF ewes and developed in IF lambs while successfully suppressed in both ISIF lambs and ISIF ewes and was confirmed by serum antibody titres.  The typical reduction in voluntary feed intake as a consequence of infection was observed in IF lambs (0.30, p&amp;lt0.001) but not in IF ewes, ISIF lambs or ISIF ewes, and appeared to be associated with L3 IgA.  Gross efficiency of use of metabolizable energy (ME) for net energy (NE) deposition was reduced by 0.20 in lambs during acquisition of immunity and by 0.16 in ewes maintaining an established immunity.  Infection in immuno-suppressed animals reduced efficiency by 0.05 and 0.15 for lambs and ewes.  These findings allowed the hypothesis that the reduction in feed intake and nutrient utilization in young parasitized sheep is caused by physiological signalling associated with the acquisition phase of the host immune response to infection, rather than simply the damage caused by the parasite per se.   

The second trial (Chapter 4) investigated the influence of metabolizable protein (MP) supply on the metabolic disturbances associated with the acquisition phase of the immune response during infection with 2,000 L3 T. colubriformis    d-1.  Groups of lambs were offered either a low protein (L; 62g MP kgDM-1) or high protein diet (H; 95g MP kgDM-1).   Patterns of total daily egg excretion indicated that an effective immune response was developed in HIF, but not LIF, HISIF nor LISF and was confirmed by comparative worm burdens.  The proportionate reduction in feed intake in immunologically normal animals was reduced through the provision of additional protein, being 0.12 in HIF and 0.23 in LIF.  Regardless of diet, infection did not cause a reduction in feed intake in immuno-suppressed animals (p&amp;gt0.05).  Infection proportionately reduced the gross efficiency of ME utilization in immunologically normal animals by 0.23 in HIF (p=0.09) and by 0.51 in LIF (p=0.01), but not in immuno-suppressed animals.  Immuno-suppression did not suppress serum L3 IgA levels in seven of the eight HISIF and four of the eight LISIF animals.  Furthermore, only four out of the eight immunologically normal animals from both the HIF and LIF groups displayed an L3 IgA response.  Consequently, regardless of immuno-suppression treatment, animals were termed as IgA responders (HR or LR) or non-responders (HN or LN).  Feed intake was proportionately reduced from day 22 by 0.15 in HR (p=0.03) and by 0.32 in LR (p=0.01), but was not significantly reduced in HN or LN.  Gross efficiency of ME utilization was significantly reduced for LN animals only, being proportionately 0.59 (p&amp;lt0.01).  These findings allowed the conclusion that additional MP reduced the consequence of immunological signalling that was displayed in reduced feed intake and in nutrient utilization, both of which appeared to be associated with an IgA response.  It is hypothesized that the lessening of nutritional disturbance observed in high protein and immuno-suppressed animals could be a consequence of altered physiological signalling during the immunological cascade.   

The third trial (Chapter 5) utilized lambs infected with the abomasal parasite T. circumcincta to explore the possibility that the reduction in feed intake and nutrient utilization is a universal phenomenon of the acquisition phase of the immune response to nematode parasites inhabiting different organs along the gastrointestinal tract.  In addition, immunological changes at the site of parasite infestation in the abomasal mucosa were measured from serial biopsy tissue samples taken from a further twelve animals that were surgically fitted with an abomasal cannula and either infected (CIF) or concurrently infected and immuno-suppressed as described previously (CISIF).  The development of immunity in IF animals was accompanied by a 0.17 proportional decrease in feed intake between days 15 to 28 of infection (p&amp;lt0.05) and a 0.20 proportional reduction in nutrient utilization (p=0.07), none of which were observed in ISIF animals.  While FEC and worm burdens indicated successful immuno-suppression in ISIF animals, both serum IgA and total antibody production were not reduced.  The development of immunity in CIF was reflected in an increase in both mast cells and globule leukocytes in serial abomasal tissue biopsies, both of which were reduced in CISIF (p&amp;lt0.01 for both).  In serial biopsy tissue, immuno-suppression did prevent a rise in tissue IgA that was apparent in CIF animals (p&amp;lt0.01) although these changes were not reflected in serum IgA levels.  It appears that the alleviation of the reduction in feed intake and nutrient utilization in young lambs through the use of corticosteroid induced immuno-suppression may be a universal phenomenon for both intestinal and abomasal parasites, but the association with and/or role of IgA during infection with T. circumcincta is unclear. 

In summary, the reduction in feed intake and nutrient utilization in sheep during infection with both the abomasal nematode T. circumcincta and the small intestine nematode T. colubriformis appears to be associated with a component(s) of the acquisition phase of the host immune response, rather than, as conventionally assumed, the direct mechanical damage of the parasite per se.  It is hypothesised that the nutritional disturbance as a consequence of infection in young lambs may be the result of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in immunological signalling that may also be associated with the production of IgA, the effects of which can be reduced through the provision of adequate MP.  These studies provide evidence that the immune response to gastrointestinal parasites is nutritionally costly to the animal and have implications for application of manipulations that are intended to promote the development of a strong immune reaction in high producing animals.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">nematoda</field><field name="subject">immunity</field><field name="subject">intake</field><field name="subject">utilisation of energy</field><field name="subject">Teladorsagia circumcincta</field><field name="subject">Trichostrongylus colubriformis</field><field name="subject">Immunoglobulin A</field><field name="subject">immuno-suppression</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20060913.203642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinants of household saving in China</field><field name="creator">Huang, Peng</field><field name="description">It is a conventional wisdom that since the start of the Chinese economic reform in 1978, the domestic saving structure in China has changed significantly. Previous studies of household saving in China (for example: Qian, 1988, Feltenstein et al, 1990, and Wakabayashi and Mackellar, 1999) have usually relied upon the Keynesian absolute-income hypothesis, Duesenberry&#146;s relative-income hypothesis, and Friedman&#146;s permanent-income hypothesis. This thesis uses the Modigliani-Brumberg life-cycle hypothesis to examine the determinants of household saving behavior in the Peoples&#146; Republic of China during the period 1978 to 2003. The research uses modern cointegration techniques to examine the impact on saving rates of economic growth, age dependency, wealth, the real interest rate, social security payments and unemployment (as a proxy for income uncertainty). Autoregressive distributed lag models are constructed and tested. The results find that economic growth, the real interest rate and social security payments have the expected effect with significant parameters; age dependency has the expected sign but in one model is not statistically significant; and that unemployment is not significant. The most surprising result is that increases in household wealth are associated with increased saving rates, which may help explain very high economic growth rates in China post 1978.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Household Savings</field><field name="subject">Life Cycle Model</field><field name="subject">Modigliani</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20061202.004631/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Late Quaternary Landscape Evolution and Environmental Change in Charwell Basin, South Island, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Matthew William</field><field name="description">Charwell Basin is a 6 km-wide structural depression situated at the boundary between the axial ranges and faulted and folded Marlborough Fault Zone of north-eastern South Island, New Zealand. The basin contains the piedmont reach of the Charwell River, and a series of late Quaternary loess-mantled alluvial terraces and terrace remnants that have been uplifted and translocated from their sediment source due to strike-slip motion along the Hope Fault which bounds the basin to its immediate north. The aim of this study was to provide an interdisciplinary, integrated and holistic analysis of late Quaternary landscape evolution and environmental change in Charwell Basin using terrain analysis, loess stratigraphy, soil chemistry and paleoecological data. The study contributes new understanding of New Zealand landscape and ecosystem responses to regional and global climatic change extending to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6, and shows that climatically-forced shifts in biogeomorphic processes play a significant role in lowland landscape evolution.

Morphometric analysis of alluvial terraces and terrace remnants of increasing age demonstrated geomorphic evolution through time, with a decrease in extent of original planar terrace tread morphology and an increase in frequency of steeper slopes and convexo-concave land elements. Paleotopographic analysis of a &amp;gt150 ka terrace mantled by up to three loess sheets revealed multiple episodes of alluvial aggradation and degradation and, subsequent to river abandonment, gully incision prior to and coeval with loess accumulation. Spatial heterogeneity in loess sheet preservation showed a complex history of loess accumulation and erosion. A critical profile curvature range of -0.005       to -0.014 (d2z/dx2, m-1) for loess erosion derived from a model parameterised in different ways successfully predicted loess occurrence on adjacent slope elements, but incorrectly predicted loess occurrence on an older terrace remnant from which all loess has been eroded. Future analyses incorporating planform curvature, regolith erosivity and other landform parameters may improve identification of thresholds controlling loess occurrence in Charwell Basin and in other South Island landscapes.

A loess chronostratigraphic framework was developed for, and pedogenic phases identified in, the three loess sheets mantling the &amp;gt150 ka terrace. Except for one age, infrared-stimulated luminescence dates from both an upbuilding interfluve loess exposure and colluvial gully infill underestimated loess age with respect to the widespread Kawakawa/Oruanui Tephra (KOT; 27,097 &#177; 957 cal. yr BP), highlighting the need for improvements in the methodology. Onset of loess sheet 1 accumulation started at ca. 50 ka, with a break at ca. 27 ka corresponding to the extended Last Glacial Maximum (eLGM) interstadial identified elsewhere in New Zealand. Loess accumulation through MIS 3 indicates a regional loess flux, and that glaciation was not a necessary condition for loess generation in South Island. Loess accumulation and local alluvial aggradation are decoupled: the youngest aggradation event only covers ~12 kyr of the period of loess sheet 1 accumulation. Older local aggradation episodes could not be the source because their associated terraces are mantled by loess sheet 1. In the absence of numerical ages, the timing of L2 and L3 accumulation is inferred on the basis of an offshore clastic sediment record. The upbuilding phase of loess sheet 2 occurred in late MIS 5a/MIS 4, and loess sheet 3 accumulated in two phases in MIS 5b and late MIS 6. 

Biogenic silica data were used to reconstruct broad shifts in vegetation and changes in gully soil saturation status. During interglacial/interstadial periods (MIS 1, early MIS 3, MIS 5) Nothofagus&#172;-dominated forest covered the area in association with Microlaena spp grasses. Lowering of treeline altitude during glacial/stadial periods (MIS 2, MIS 3, MIS 5b, late MIS 6) led to reduction in forest cover and a mosaic of shrubs and Chionochloa spp, Festuca spp and Poa spp tussock grasses. Comparison of interfluve and gully records showed spatial heterogeneity in vegetation cover possibly related to environmental gradients of exposure or soil moisture. A post-KOT peak in gully tree phytoliths corresponds to the eLGM interstadial, and a shift to grass-dominated vegetation occurred during the LGM sensu stricto. Diatoms indicated the site became considerably wetter from ca. 36 ka, with peak wetness at ca. 30, 25 and 21 ka, possibly due to reduced evapotranspiration and/or increased precipitation from a combination of strengthened westerly winds and increased cloudiness, or strengthened southerly flow and increased precipitation. Human influence after ca. 750 yr BP led to re-establishment of grassland in the area, which deposited phytoliths mixed to 30 cm depth in the soil.

A coupled gully colluvial infilling/vegetation record showed that sediment flux during the late Pleistocene was ~0.0019 m3 m-1 yr-1 under a shrubland/grassland mosaic, and Holocene sediment flux was ~0.0034 m3 m-1 yr-1 under forest. This increase of 60% through the last glacial-interglacial transition resulted from increased bioturbation and down-slope soil transport via root growth and treethrow, which formed a biomantle as evidenced by slope redistribution of the KOT. These results contrast with sediment transport rates and processes hypothesised to occur contemporaneously in adjacent mountain catchments. This suggests that intraregional biogeomorphic processes can differ significantly depending on topography and geological substrate, with different landscapes responding in unique ways to the same climate shifts. Analysis of Quaternary terrestrial landscape evolution in non-glaciated mountainous and lowland areas must therefore consider spatial and temporal heterogeneity in sediment fluxes and underlying transport processes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">landscape evolution</field><field name="subject">Quaternary climate change</field><field name="subject">biogeomorphology</field><field name="subject">soil stratigraphy</field><field name="subject">loess</field><field name="subject">aggradation</field><field name="subject">degradation</field><field name="subject">fill terrace</field><field name="subject">fill-cut terrace</field><field name="subject">Kawakawa/Oruanui Tephra</field><field name="subject">luminescence dating</field><field name="subject">phytoliths</field><field name="subject">pedogenesis</field><field name="subject">soil phosphorus</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080214.132530/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing ecosystem services in vineyards to improve the management of Botrytis cinerea</field><field name="creator">Jacometti, Marco Alexander Azon</field><field name="description">Organic mulches and cover crops mulched in situ were assessed for their effects on B. cinerea primary inoculum and disease levels in inflorescences at flowering and/or bunches at harvest.
Organic mulches were used to enhance biological degradation of vine debris to reduce levels of B. cinerea primary inoculum the following season. Four mulch types (anaerobically and aerobically fermented marc (grape pressings), inter-row grass clippings and shredded office paper) were applied under ten-year-old Riesling vines in a ten-replicate randomized block design in New Zealand over two consecutive years. Plastic mesh bags, each containing naturally infected vine debris, were placed under vines on bare ground (control) and at the soil-mulch interface, in winter (July) 2003 and 2004. In each year, half the bags were recovered at flowering (December) and the remainder at leaf plucking (February), for assessment of B. cinerea sporulation from the vine debris and debris degradation rate. Bait lamina probes, which measure soil biological activity, were placed in the soil-mulch interface three weeks before each of the two bag-recovery dates in both years and were then removed and assessed at the same times as were the bags. All mulches led to a reduction in B. cinerea sporulation. This reduction was significantly correlated with elevated rates of vine debris decomposition and increased soil biological activity. Over both years, compared with the controls, all treatments gave a 3-20-fold reduction in B. cinerea sporulation, a 1.6-2.6-fold increase in vine debris degradation and in the two marc and the paper treatments, a 1.8-4-fold increase in activity of soil organisms. 
The mulches also altered vine characteristics and elevated their resistance to B. cinerea through changes to the soil environment. Functional soil biological activity, as measured by Biolog Ecoplates and bait lamina probes, was increased 2-4 times in the two marc and paper treatments, compared with the control, an effect relating to the elevated soil moisture and reduced temperature fluctuations under these mulches. Soil nutrient levels and the C:N ratios were also affected in these treatments. The mulched paper lowered vine canopy density by up to 1.4 times that of the other treatments, an effect which probably led to elevated light penetration into the canopy and consequent increased canopy temperature, photosynthesis and lowered canopy humidity. These changes to soil and vine characteristics increased grape skin strength by up to 10% in the paper treatment and sugar concentrations by 1.2-1.4 &#176;Brix in the two marc and paper treatments. The severity of B. cinerea infections in the anaerobic marc, aerobic marc and paper treatments were reduced to 12%, 3% and 2.2% of the control, respectively, in field assessments averaged over two consecutive harvests. 
Cover crops mulched in situ had similar effects to those of the organic mulches, increasing soil biological activity and reducing B. cinerea primary inoculum and the severity of B. cinerea infection in grapes at harvest (2006). Inter-row phacelia and ryegrass were mulched in winter 2005 and compared with a bare ground control, under 10-year-old Chardonnay vines in a ten-replicate randomized block design. Functional soil biological activity increased by 1.5-4.5 times in the two cover crop treatments compared with the control, an effect possibly related to elevated soil moisture in these treatments. This increase in soil moisture and soil biological activity increased vine debris degradation, reduced B. cinerea primary inoculum on the debris and decreased B. cinerea severity at flowering (December 2005) and harvest (April 2006). 
These results show the potential of organic mulches and cover crops mulched in situ to enhance soil ecosystem services and improve the sustainability of viticultural practices.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botrytis cinerea</field><field name="subject">cover crop</field><field name="subject">mulch</field><field name="subject">conservation biological control</field><field name="subject">soil biological activity</field><field name="subject">vine debris degradation</field><field name="subject">primary inoculum</field><field name="subject">grape vines</field><field name="subject">vine resistance</field><field name="subject">yield</field><field name="subject">grape quality.</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20070126.115223/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Demand for genetically modified food : theory and empirical findings</field><field name="creator">Kaye-Blake, William Henry</field><field name="description">As economies develop, novel products are created and markets for these products arise. Genetically modified food (GMF) is an example of such a novel product and provides economists with the opportunity to investigate an infant market. Of particular interest with GMF is the impact of consumer reactions on the market. The response of consumers to GMF and their willingness to pay for it has emerged as an important factor in the development of this technology.
This research investigates these consumer responses. Prior research suggests that two aspects of consumer behaviour may be relevant for the GMF market. First, consumers may react differently to different types of GMF, so that some products are potentially more economically viable. Secondly, some consumers appear to prefer not having GMF at all.
Consumer behaviour is often framed according to neoclassical economic theory. Consumer preferences over goods and the attributes of those goods are generally held to have certain properties. The aspects of consumers&#146; reactions to GMF noted above, however, may be in conflict with two properties of preferences in neoclassical theory. First, preferences over food attributes are not separable, but may interact with each other. Secondly, some consumers may have preferences regarding GMF that are not continuous. As a result, aggregate impacts of introducing GMF may be difficult to measure, which raises a third issue for investigation, aggregation. 
Finally, an alternative model of consumer behaviour is bounded rationality, which theorises that choices may be discontinuous as a result of specific protocols. It also suggests that consumers seek to make good-enough choices, rather than attempting to maximise their satisfaction. Thus, optimisation or maximisation is the fourth issue considered in this thesis.
In order to investigate these properties of consumers&#146; preferences, a choice experiment survey was developed. The strength of a choice experiment for examining these issues is its focus on the impact of each product attribute on a respondent&#146;s choices. Thus, it may be possible to identify potentially discontinuous choice patterns and to identify choices affected by interactions between GM technology and other food attributes. 
Results from a neoclassical analysis of the survey data suggest that some consumers consider the type of benefit created with GM technology in making their choices. In addition, one-quarter to one-half of respondents may have had discontinuous preferences with respect to GMF. Reactions to GMF appear related to respondents&#146; attitudes, but not to socio-economic or demographic descriptors. As a result, aggregate measures of the impact of GMF may not fully account for consumers&#146; responses. A boundedly rational model also has reasonable goodness of fit, and may provide a different perspective on consumer behaviour.
It is hoped that the results of this research provide a better understanding of consumer behaviour regarding GMF and, by extension, of the process of consumer adoption of novel products. It is further hoped that this attempt to incorporate choice protocols into discrete choice analysis will provide a useful example for further research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetically modified food</field><field name="subject">choice modelling</field><field name="subject">bounded rationality</field><field name="subject">lexicographic</field><field name="subject">consumer behaviour</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20060913.102217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of antioxidants in the hydrogen peroxide-induced opacification of sheep lens.</field><field name="creator">Lei, Jie</field><field name="description">The lens of the eye needs to be transparent with a high refractive index to focus images on the retina. In cataracts the lens becomes opaque, eventually leading to blindness. There are many possible causes of cataract but a lot of evidence implicates oxidative damage as contributing to opacification. This includes epidemiological studies showing that diets rich in antioxidants lowered the prevalence of cataract. This research tested the hypothesis that if cataracts were at least partially caused by oxidative damage then their progression would be slowed by application of antioxidants. The antioxidants used were two plant compounds found in the diet, resveratrol and quercetin. The system used was sheep lenses cultured in Eagles Minimal Essential Medium (EMEM). Lenses remained transparent for up to 7 days in EMEM but became opaque within 24 h when exposed to 1 mM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The lens is exposed to H2O2 in vivo as it is found in the aqueous humor. Prior Lenses pre-treated with quercetin reduced but did not prevent opacification. Lens cell death, as determined by measurement of leakage of lactate dehydrogenase, was found to increase with H2O2 and the increase was prevented by pre-treatment with antioxidants. The role of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione was also investigated. It was found that H2O2 decreased the amount of reduced glutathione in the lens cortex and increased the levels of oxidised glutathione but only at levels of 2 mM and above. Thus the results of this research indicate that H2O2 at low concentration (1 mM) is able to damage lens cells and cause opacification without affecting the reduced glutathione levels and that the exogenous antioxidants have some ability to protect the lens.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep lens</field><field name="subject">oxidative damage</field><field name="subject">antioxidant</field><field name="subject">quercetin</field><field name="subject">resveratrol</field><field name="subject">cataract</field><field name="subject">lactate dehydrogenase</field><field name="subject">glutathione</field><field name="subject">Eagles minimal essential medium</field><field name="subject">hydrogen peroxide</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20070517.162145/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Examination of Implementing Customer Relationship Management by Chinese-Owned SMEs</field><field name="creator">Lin, Chien Yun</field><field name="description">In the last decade, the ever increasing pressure of competition faced by businesses has led to the development of Customer Relationship Management (CRM). In short, CRM is the practice of integrating all aspects of business functions for dealing with customers, with the assistance of technology, and with the intention of boosting company profitability. CRM has been widely promoted as a critical contributor to business survival. However, the high failure rate of CRM projects has also attracted research attention and many factors have been discussed as contributing to the success or failure of CRM implementation. 
  
This research argues that CRM is not simply a software package or a computer program. CRM, instead, should be perceived as a strategic issue in order to realize its potential. In addition, this study also argues that CRM implementation is affected by organizational, strategic and cultural factors. In particular, this study was conducted within the context of Chinese small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), with company size and culture as two major focuses in this study. SMEs were chosen as this segment has been overlooked in CRM study, yet it represents a great potential for growth in CRM adoption. Chinese culture was chosen as most of CRM studies have been conducted within a western cultural background. The Chinese culture has distinctive characteristics different from western culture, and this has strong influences on business operations.

A quantitative method was adopted for this study and a mailed survey was used to collect data to examine the relevance of these factors within this context. Research participants were recruited using a systematic sampling technique through a comprehensive Chinese business directory. Results suggest that there are positive associations between a company&#146;s CRM implementation and its practice of organizational, strategic, and cultural issues. In particular, four organizational issues &#150; organizational integration, executive commitment, system readiness, and resource availability; three strategic issues &#150; vision, planning, and customer-centric culture; and one cultural issue &#150; networking, have an impact on a company&#146;s CRM implementation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Customer Relationship Management (CRM)</field><field name="subject">Small and Medium-size Enterprises (SMEs)</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">relationship marketing</field><field name="subject">implementation</field><field name="subject">customer service</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080305.051641/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation of Stochastic Neural Networks for Approximating Random Processes</field><field name="creator">Ling, Hong</field><field name="description">Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can be viewed as a mathematical model to simulate natural and biological systems on the basis of mimicking the information processing methods in the human brain. The capability of current ANNs only focuses on approximating arbitrary deterministic input-output mappings. However, these ANNs do not adequately represent the variability which is observed in the systems&#146; natural settings as well as capture the complexity of the whole system behaviour. This thesis addresses the development of a new class of neural networks called Stochastic Neural Networks (SNNs) in order to simulate internal stochastic properties of systems. Developing a suitable mathematical model for SNNs is based on canonical representation of stochastic processes or systems by means of Karhunen-Lo&#232;ve Theorem. Some successful real examples, such as analysis of full displacement field of wood in compression, confirm the validity of the proposed neural networks. Furthermore, analysis of internal workings of SNNs provides an in-depth view on the operation of SNNs that help to gain a better understanding of the simulation of stochastic processes by SNNs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">approximate identity neural networks; digital image correlation; Karhunen-Lo&#232;ve theorem; stochastic neural networks; stochastic processes; white noise; wood structure; wood displacement.</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080108.124352/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predator interactions within a trophic level : Phalangium opilio L. (Arachnida: Opiliones) and mites (Arachnida: Acari)</field><field name="creator">Merfield, Charles Norman</field><field name="description">This study investigated commensal feeding interactions between the European harvestman (P. opilio L.) and the predatory mites Balaustium spp. and Anystis baccarum L.  It also investigated the feeding behaviour of P. opilio.  Experiments were conducted in the laboratory using standardised temperature, humidity, photoperiod and experimental arenas, with eggs of the brown blowfly (Calliphora stygia F.) as prey facsimiles.  Due to initial difficulties in obtaining enough predatory mites, mite feeding was manually simulated piercing blowfly eggs with a minuten pin.  
P. opilio consumed significantly more freeze-killed than live blowfly eggs, indicating that freezing induced chemical and/or physical changes to blowfly eggs that are detected by P. opilio.  Significantly more manually pierced eggs were consumed by P. opilio compared with unpierced ones, demonstrating that piercing caused a chemical and/or physical to the egg and increased the feeding rates of P. opilio.  
Different densities of eggs had no effect on the numbers eaten by P. opilio and placing single pierced eggs next to groups of unpierced eggs also had no effect on the numbers of unpierced eggs eaten.  These results suggest that P. opilio does not exhibit klinokinesis or orthokinesis to intensify its search for prey around the area where previous prey were located.  
P. opilio ate significantly more brown blowfly eggs that had previously been fed on by mites, demonstrating that a short term commensal interaction existed.  However,  further work is required to demonstrate if the relationship is commensal in the longer term.  A comparison between hand-pierced and mite-pierced eggs showed that P. opilio ate significantly more of the former indicating that mite and hand piercing were quantitatively different.  
The potential for, and importance of, other commensal or mutual relationships between predators in agroecosystems is discussed.  The lack of klinokinesis and orthokinesis in P. opilio is compared with other predators and parasitoids that do exhibit these behaviours.  The means by which prey are detected by P. opilio are discussed in relation to interpreting behaviours such as prey inspection.  Concerns about the effect of pre-treatment and handling of sentinel prey and the problems of using prey facsimiles are raised.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agroecosystem</field><field name="subject">Anystis baccarum</field><field name="subject">Balaustium spp.</field><field name="subject">Calliphora stygia</field><field name="subject">commensalism</field><field name="subject">European harvestmen</field><field name="subject">klinokinesis</field><field name="subject">orthokinesis</field><field name="subject">P. opilio</field><field name="subject">predators</field><field name="subject">prey facsimiles</field><field name="subject">sentinel prey</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20060908.204153</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Audio-visual information programs as health promotion aids in hospital waiting rooms</field><field name="creator">O'Connor, Peter J.

The experiment was a split plot design with main plots of fully irrigated (I) or dryland (D), sub-plots of N fertiliser at 800 kg N/ha in 2003/04;  and 1600 kg N/ha in 2004/05 (+N) or 0 kg N/ha (-N). The potential environmental yield of an established 8 year old cocksfoot dominant pasture was 21.9 t DM/ha/y from I+N pastures compared with 9.8 t DM/ha by I-N pastures and 15.1 t DM/ha/y by D+N pastures. The lowest yields were from dryland pastures with no N which produced 7.5 t DM/ha/y in 2003/03 and 5.0 t DM/ha/y in 2004/05. 
The effect of seasonal temperatures on the DM production, when periods of water stress were excluded, was quantified using thermal time accumulated above a base temperature of 3&#176;C as 7.0 kg DM/&#176;Cd/ha for N fertilised pastures and 3.3 kg DM/&#176;Cd/ha for pastures with no N. 
The 2.5 t DM/ha difference in yields of D-N pastures in 2003/04 and 2004/05 was the result of the duration, extent and timing of the water stress period. In both years the critical limiting deficit (DL) was calculated as 78 mm from the soil moisture deficit in the 0-0.8 m soil layers. Beyond DL yield decreased at a rate of 1.45%/mm in +N and &#150;N pastures, relative to fully irrigated control pastures. 
Yields of D+N and D-N pastures were similar during periods of water stress with 0.4&#177;0.1 t/DM/ha produced during the rotation ending 30/12/2003. This was less than from either the I-N (1.2 t DM/ha) or I+N (3.5 t DM/ha) pastures due to the reduction in the amount of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the canopies of the dryland pastures. However, in the rotation ending 2/5/2004, after autumn rain alleviated drought conditions, yield of the D+N pasture was 2.1 t DM/ha compared with 1.7 t DM/ha by I+N pastures. 
The effect of N on yield was described using a nutrition index which showed that as DM yield increased N% in the herbage declined. This is a function of the ratio between metabolic and structural N requirements rather than caused by ontogeny alone. Specific leaf N was determined at two harvests and appeared constant at a given point in time (1.0-1.6 g N/m&#178; leaf). In contrast, specific pseudostem N increased from 0.8-1.0 g N/m&#178; pseudostem at an NNI of 0.4 in &#150;N pastures to 2.6-3.0 g N/m&#178; pseudostem at an NNI of 1.2 in the +N pastures.
Differences between the yields of +N and &#150;N pastures were caused by differences in radiation use efficiency (RUE) as determined by the linear relationship (R&#178;=0.76) between RUE and the nitrogen nutrition index (NNI). 
In this thesis, empirical relationships for the effects of temperature, water availability and N were derived and the physiological mechanisms which underlie these descriptions were identified. These relationships provide clear and simple explanations of the effects of environmental variables on the productivity of cocksfoot based pastures which will enhance understanding of the benefits and limitations of cocksfoot, particularly in dryland farming systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cocksfoot</field><field name="subject">Dactylis glomerata</field><field name="subject">leaf area index</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">orchardgrass</field><field name="subject">radiation interception</field><field name="subject">radiation use efficiency</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="subject">water stress</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20070717.161658/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of wild deer in the epidemiology and management of bovine tuberculosis in New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Nugent, Graham</field><field name="description">The eco-epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis (Tb) in wild deer (mainly red deer Cervus elaphus) in New Zealand was investigated. Bovine Tb is caused by Mycobacterium bovis. Specific aims were to clarify the likely routes of infection in deer, and to determine the status of deer as hosts of Tb, the likely rates and routes of inter- and intra-species transmission between deer and other wildlife hosts, the role of deer in spreading Tb, and the likely utility of deer as sentinels of Tb presence in wildlife. As the possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is the main wildlife host of Tb, the research also included some investigation of transmission routes in possums.
Patterns of infection were measured in 994 deer killed between 1993 and 2003. Tb prevalence varied between areas (range 8&#150;36%). Few deer had generalised infection, with 21&#150;68% of infected deer having no visible lesions, depending on the area. The retropharyngeal lymph nodes and oropharyngeal tonsils were commonly infected. No dependent fawns less than 0.75 years old were infected, indicating intra-species transmission is rare in wild deer. Where possums were not controlled, the net (cumulative) force of infection in young (1&#150;4 y) deer was 0.10&#150;0.24 per year in males and 0.09&#150;0.12 per year in females, but much lower in older deer (less than 0.05 per year). Possum control reduced the net force of infection quickly, and eventually to zero. However, Tb persisted in possum-controlled areas through immigration of infected deer and, for almost a decade, through the survival of resident deer infected before possum control. Tb was lost from infected deer at an exponential rate of 0.13 per year, mostly as a result of deer recovering from infection rather than dying from it. Wild deer do die of Tb, but there was no discernible effect on age structure. The occurrence of infection in deer was not linked to the local deer or possum density at their kill sites (i.e. in their home range), but the area-wide prevalence of Tb in deer was closely correlated with Tb levels in possums, which were in turn correlated with area-wide measures of possum density. For wild deer in New Zealand, Tb is a persistent but usually inconsequential disease of the lymphatic system. It is acquired mainly by young independent deer, usually orally via the tonsils, and probably as a result of licking infected possums.
Many species fed on deer carrion, including possums. Most possums encountering carrion did not feed on it, but a few fed for long periods. Other scavengers such ferrets (Mustela furo), hawks (Circus approximans), and weka (a hen-sized flightless native bird; Gallirallus australis) fed in a way that probably increased the infectivity of carrion to possums. Commercial deer hunting may have facilitated the historical establishment of Tb in possums. Scavenging (including cannibalism) and interactions with dead and dying possums are identified for the first time as potentially important routes for transmission of Tb to possums, and I develop new hypotheses involving peri- and post-mortem transmission in possums that explain many of the epidemiological patterns that are characteristic of the disease in possum. 
In continuous native forest, deer home range size averaged 250 hectares for six young females, and over twice that for two males. Over 90% of infected deer are likely to die within 2 km (females) or 6 km (males) of where they acquired Tb, but deer could occasionally carry Tb up to 30 km. Deer will be useful as sentinels, but only where other sentinels are rare, because the force of infection for a deer with a single infected possum in its home range is only 0.004 per year, compared to greater than 0.2 per year for deliberately released pigs. Deer are occasionally capable of initiating new cycles of infection in wildlife, but deer control is not essential to eradicate Tb from wildlife.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">bovine tuberculosis</field><field name="subject">Mycobacterium bovis</field><field name="subject">wild deer</field><field name="subject">Cervus elaphus</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Tb</field><field name="subject">pathogenesis</field><field name="subject">brushtail possum</field><field name="subject">Trichosurus vulpecula</field><field name="subject">prevalence</field><field name="subject">intra-species transmission</field><field name="subject">inter-species transmission</field><field name="subject">resolution of infection</field><field name="subject">scavenging</field><field name="subject">cannibalism</field><field name="subject">sentinel</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20070212.130927/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimisation of permeable reactive barrier systems for the remediation of contaminated groundwater</field><field name="creator">Painter, Brett Duncan Murray</field><field name="description">Permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) are one of the leading technologies being developed in the search for alternatives to the pump-and-treat method for the remediation of contaminated groundwater. A new optimising design methodology is proposed to aid decision-makers in finding minimum cost PRB designs for remediation problems in the presence of input uncertainty. The unique aspects of the proposed methodology are considered to be: design enhancements to improve the hydraulic performance of PRB systems; elimination of a time-consuming simulation model by determination of approximating functions relating design variables and performance measures for fully penetrating PRB systems; a versatile, spreadsheet-based optimisation model that locates minimum cost PRB designs using Excel's standard non-linear solver; and the incorporation of realistic input variability and uncertainty into the optimisation process via sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis and factorial analysis. The design methodology is developed in the context of the remediation of nitrate contamination due to current concerns with nitrate in New Zealand. Three-dimensional computer modelling identified significant variation in capture and residence time, caused by up-gradient funnels and/or a gate hydraulic conductivity that is significantly different from the surrounding aquifer. The unique design enhancements to control this variation are considered to be the customised down-gradient gate face and emplacement of funnels and side walls deeper than the gate. The use of velocity equalisation walls and manipulation of a PRB's hydraulic conductivity within certain bounds were also found to provide some control over variation in capture and residence time. Accurate functional relationships between PRB design variables and PRB performance measures were shown to be achievable for fully penetrating systems. The chosen design variables were gate length, gate width, funnel width and the reactive material proportion. The chosen performance measures were edge residence, centreline residence and capture width. A method for laboratory characterisation of reactive and non-reactive material combinations was shown to produce data points that could realistically be part of smooth polynomial interpolation functions. The use of smooth approximating functions to characterise PRB inputs and determine PRB performance enabled the creation of an efficient spreadsheet model that ran more quickly and accurately with Excel's standard non-linear solver than with the LGO global solver or Evolver genetic-algorithm based solver. The PRB optimisation model will run on a standard computer and only takes a couple of minutes per optimisation run. Significant variation is expected in inputs to PRB design, particularly in aquifer and plume characteristics. Not all of this variation is quantifiable without significant expenditure. Stochastic models that include parameter variability have historically been difficult to apply to realistic remediation design due to their size and complexity. Scenario and factorial analysis are proposed as an efficient alternative for quantifying the effects of input variability on optimal PRB design. Scenario analysis is especially recommended when high quality input information is available and variation is not expected in many input parameters. Factorial analysis is recommended for most other situations as it separates out the effects of multiple input parameters at multiple levels without an excessive number of experimental runs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">optimisation</field><field name="subject">permeable reactive barrier</field><field name="subject">remediation</field><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">contamination</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20061220.151030/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protoplast fusion of Lolium perenne and Lotus corniculatus for gene introgression</field><field name="creator">Raikar, Sanjeev Vencu</field><field name="description">Protoplast fusion of Lolium perenne and Lotus corniculatus for gene introgression
by Sanjeev V. Raikar
Lolium perenne is one of the most important forage crops globally and in New Zealand. Lotus corniculatus is a dicotyledonous forage that contains valuable traits such as high levels of condensed tannins, increased digestibility, and high nitrogen fixing abilities. However, conventional breeding between these two forage crops is impossible due to their markedly different taxonomic origin. Protoplast fusion (somatic hybridisation) provides an opportunity for gene introgression between these two species. This thesis describes the somatic hybridisation, the regeneration and the molecular analysis of the putative somatic hybrid plants obtained between L. perenne and L. corniculatus.
Callus and cell suspensions of different cultivars of L. perenne were established from immature embryos and plants were regenerated from the callus. Of the 10 cultivars screened, cultivars Bronsyn and Canon had the highest percentage of callus induction at 36% each on 5 mg/L 2,4-D. Removal of the palea and lemma which form the seed coat was found to increase callus induction ability of the embryos. Plant regeneration from the callus was achieved when the callus was plated on LS medium supplemented with plant growth regulators at different concentrations. Variable responses to shoot regeneration was observed between the different cultivars with the cv Kingston having the lowest frequency of shoot formation (12%). 
Different factors affecting the protoplast isolation of L. perenne were investigated. The highest protoplast yield of 10&#215;106 g-1FW was obtained when cell suspensions were used as the tissue source, with enzyme combination &#145;A&#146; (Cellulase Onozuka RS 2%, Macerozyme R-10 1%, Driselase 0.5%, Pectolyase 0.2%), for 6 h incubation period in 0.6 M mannitol. Development of microcolonies was only achieved when protoplasts were plated on nitrocellulose membrane with a L. perenne feeder layer on PEL medium. All the shoots regenerated from the protoplast-derived calli were albino shoots. 
The highest protoplast yield (7&#215;106 g-1FW) of L. corniculatus was achieved from cotyledons also with enzyme combination &#145;A&#146; (Cellulase Onozuka RS 2%, Macerozyme R-10 1%, Driselase 0.5%, Pectolyase 0.2%), for 6 h incubation period in 0.6 M mannitol. The highest plating efficiency for L. corniculatus of 1.57 % was achieved when protoplasts were plated on nitrocellulose membrane with a L. perenne feeder layer on PEL medium. The highest frequency of shoot regeneration (46%) was achieved when calli were plated on LS medium with NAA (0.1 mg/L) and BA (0.1 mg/L).
Protoplast fusion between L. perenne and L. corniculatus was performed using the asymmetric somatic hybridisation technique using PEG as the fusogen. L. perenne protoplasts were treated with 0.1 mM IOA for 15 min and L. corniculatus protoplasts were treated with UV at 0.15 J/cm2 for 10 min. Various parameters affecting the fusion percentage were investigated. Successful fusions were obtained when the fusions were conducted on a plastic surface with 35% PEG (3350 MW)  for 25 min duration, followed by 100 mM calcium chloride treatment for 25 min. A total of 14 putative fusion colonies were recovered. Shoots were regenerated from 8 fusion colonies. Unexpectedly, the regenerated putative hybrid plants resembled L. corniculatus plants.
The flow cytometric profile of the putative somatic hybrids resembled that of L. corniculatus. Molecular analysis using SD-AFLP, SCARs and Lolium specific chloroplast microsatellite markers suggest that the putative somatic hybrids could be L. corniculatus escapes from the asymmetric protoplast fusion process.

While farmers face complex situations, particularly when subsistence is an issue, they do appear to use simple rules in their decision making.  To date inadequate attention has been given to understanding their reasoning processes in creating the rules, so this study traces the origins of farmers' beliefs, and extracts the decisive and dynamic elements in their decision making systems to provide this understanding.     

The analysis was structured by using a model based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB).  Modifications included recognizing a bargaining process (BP) and other decision stimuli to represent socio-cultural influences and sources of perception, respectively.  Two analyses based on the Personal Construct Theory (PCT) and the Ethnographic Decision Tree Modelling (EDTM) were also applied to help elaborate the farmers' cognitive process and actual decision criteria.  The method involved interviews in two villages in Lamongan Regency in East Java Province of Indonesia, where the farmers adopted an improved paddy-prawn system ("pandu"). 

The results highlighted that farmers use rational strategies, and that socio-cultural factors influence decision making.  This was represented by interactions between the farmers' perceptions, their bargaining effort, and various background factors.  The TPB model revealed that the farmers' perceptions about the potential of "pandu", and the interaction with their "significant others", influenced their intention to adopt "pandu".  The farmers appeared to prefer a steady income and familiar practices at the same time as obtaining new information, mainly from their peers.  When "pandu" failed to show sufficiently profitable results, most farmers decided to ignore or discontinue "pandu".  This became the biggest disincentive to a wide and sustainable adoption.  However, the PCT analysis showed that part of this problem also stemmed from the farmers' lack of resources and knowledge.

The farmers' restrictive conditions also led them to seek socio-cultural and practical support for their actions. This was highlighted by a bargaining process (BP) that integrated what the farmers had learned, and believed, into their adoption behaviour.  The BP also captured the farmers' communication strategies when dealing with "pandu" as its adoption affected resource allocation within the family and required cooperation with neighbours.  The PCT and EDTM analyses also confirmed how the BP accommodated different sets of decision criteria to form different adoption behaviours.  Such a process indicated the importance of considering the adoption decision and the relevant changes resulting from the farmers' cognition.  This provided a more dynamic and realistic description of the farmers' decision-making process than has previously been attempted.  

Overall, the results suggested that semi-commercial farmers need to know, and confirm, that a new technology is significantly superior to the existing system, and can provide a secure income.  The introduction of a new technology should use a participatory approach allowing negotiation, conflict mitigation and the creation of consensus among the relevant parties.  This can be supported through better access to knowledge, information and financing. A specific and well-targeted policy intervention may also be needed to accommodate the diversity in the farmers' ways of learning and making decisions.  Ways to improve the current analytical approaches are also suggested.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">decision</field><field name="subject">adoption</field><field name="subject">semi-commercial farmers</field><field name="subject">planned behaviour</field><field name="subject">bargaining process</field><field name="subject">personal construct</field><field name="subject">decision tree</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080107.151045/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of ripening grape compounds on behavioural responses of birds</field><field name="creator">Saxton, Valerie Patricia</field><field name="description">Vineyards in New Zealand suffer bird damage caused by several avian species, including blackbirds and silvereyes. The introduced European Blackbird takes whole grapes which reduces yield. The self-introduced Australasian Silvereye pecks on grapes, leaving them on the vine to be further attacked by fungi and bacteria, and the subsequent off-odours can cause grapes to be refused by the winery or to suffer a price-reduction. Bird control methods remain primitive and largely ineffective during the long ripening period of wine grapes. An ecologically sound method to manage and reduce bird pressure requires deeper understanding of why some birds eat grapes, especially since grapes are not particularly nutritious.

This work investigated the extent to which blackbirds and silvereyes are attracted by various compounds in ripening grapes. Since in natural grapes these compounds develop and change simultaneously, I developed an artificial grape in which a single parameter could be investigated. Artificial grapes (and sometimes nectar) were presented on a bird feeder table and the responses of birds to hexose sugars, the aromas 2-3-isobutylmethoxypyrazine and geraniol, tartaric and malic acids, grape tannins, and purple and green colour were recorded on timelapse video and analysed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vineyards</field><field name="subject">bird damage</field><field name="subject">artificial grape</field><field name="subject">blackbirds</field><field name="subject">silvereyes</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="subject">hexose sugar</field><field name="subject">aroma</field><field name="subject">acid</field><field name="subject">colour</field><field name="subject">tannin</field><field name="subject">bird management</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20061207.121738/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rural tourism in the 'Third World' :
the dialectic of development : the case of Desa Senaru at Gunung Rinjani National Park 
in Lombok Island</field><field name="creator">Schellhorn, Matthias</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the effectiveness of tourism as an agent of rural development, focusing on culture and nature-based destinations in the 'developing world'. The village of Desa Senaru at Gunung Rinjani National Park in Lombok Island, Indonesia, served as a case study.

Conservation agencies frequently support tourism development as a sustainable alternative to more extractive resource uses. Integrated conservation models, in particular, present 'eco'tourism as an effective instrument to enhance rural livelihoods while protecting the environment. Alongside international aid agencies, the World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) also promotes the sector for its poverty reduction potential in 'third world' countries. Rural communities hold concomitant expectations of tourism's socio-cultural development potential. Furthermore, 'eco'tourism functions as a growing niche market for the globally expanding tourism industry and local entrepreneurs. As such it fits well into the economic rationale that underpins neo-liberal market strategies. With such a diversity of interests at stake, the question "What kind of business is tourism?" has become more complex, critical and pertinent than ever before.

Informed by development theories and the sociology of tourism, this analysis focuses on the multiple dichotomies that characterise 'third world' tourism. In the case of tourism development in Desa Senaru, several paradoxical outcomes have been identified. The most profound of these is the 'social justice paradox' that describes the way tourism costs and benefits are distributed within a heterogeneous community of native residents and migrant settlers. While most of the case study's tourism attractions are part of the cultural heritage of the wetu telu Sasak hamlets, these derive few economic benefits and struggle to access the new development opportunities 'eco'tourism offers. Filtered and directed by historical political relations, several key barriers to a meaningful participation of these native people in the 'business of tourism' have been identified. These include the prevailing conditions of education, culture, ethnicity, socio-economy, location, mobility, skills and knowledge.

Expectations of 'eco'tourism as a 'soft' industry analysed vis-&#224;-vis the global biosphere effects of air transport highlight the 'eco-paradox' of international tourism. The cleavage between the poverty-focused aid policies of the New Zealand Government and an integrated conservation project, whose benefits local elites have largely captured, illustrates the 'project paradox' of rural tourism development programmes.

In the 'development paradox' of cultural tourism, symbolic constructs of 'otherness' (such as 'aesthetic poverty') contrast with various development agendas; in their search for the 'real' traditional village, for example, the tourists reject all signifiers of material progress and modernity. Their curious gaze at the spiritual practices and everyday life world of the wetu telu villagers manifests opposite a recent history of state-sanctioned religious discrimination. Taken together, these paradoxical local outcomes emphasize the significance of power relations and political dimensions within the globally expanding 'business of tourism'.

Ethical considerations are an important aspect of this study as they contribute towards an 'ethic of development' that, so far, has found little theoretical resonance amongst scholars of tourism studies. To operationalise the ethical concerns raised, the thesis posits a model of a holistic approach to development. This recognises tourism as a complex open system.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Lombok</field><field name="subject">ecotourism</field><field name="subject">cultural tourism</field><field name="subject">wetu telu</field><field name="subject">tourism development</field><field name="subject">development project</field><field name="subject">tourism ethics</field><field name="subject">open system</field><field name="subject">holistic development</field><field name="subject">paradox</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080221.124834/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of long- and short-term crop management on soil biological properties and nitrogen dynamics</field><field name="creator">Stark, Christine</field><field name="description">To date, there has been little research into the role of microbial community structure in the functioning of the soil ecosystem and on the links between microbial biomass size, microbial activity and key soil processes that drive nutrient availability. The maintenance of structural and functional diversity of the soil microbial community is essential to ensure the sustainability of agricultural production systems. Soils of the same type with similar fertility that had been under long-term organic and conventional crop management in Canterbury, New Zealand, were selected to investigate relationships between microbial community composition, function and potential environmental impacts. The effects of different fertilisation strategies on soil biology and nitrogen (N) dynamics were investigated under field (farm site comparison), semi-controlled (lysimeter study) and controlled (incubation experiments) conditions by determining soil microbial biomass carbon (C) and N, enzyme activities (dehydrogenase, arginine deaminase, fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis), microbial community structure (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis following PCR amplification of 16S and 18S rDNA fragments using selected primer sets) and N dynamics (mineralisation and leaching). The farm site comparison revealed distinct differences between the soils in microbial community structure, microbial biomass C (conventional &gt; organic) and arginine deaminase activity (organic &gt; conventional). In the lysimeter study, the soils were subjected to the same crop rotation (barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), maize (Zea mays L.), rape (Brassica napus L. ssp. oleifera (Moench)) plus a lupin green manure (Lupinus angustifolius L.) and two fertiliser regimes (following common organic and conventional practice). Soil biological properties, microbial community structure and mineral N leaching losses were determined over 2&#189; years. Differences in mineral leaching losses were not significant between treatments (total organic management: 24.2 kg N per ha; conventional management: 28.6 kg N per ha). Crop rotation and plant type had a larger influence on the microbial biomass, activity and community structure than fertilisation. Initial differences between soils decreased over time for most biological soil properties, while they persisted for the enzyme activities (e.g. dehydrogenase activity: 4.0 and 2.9 &#181;g per g and h for organic and conventional management history, respectively). A lack of consistent positive links between enzyme activities and microbial biomass size indicated that similarly sized and structured microbial communities can express varying rates of activity. 
In two successive incubation experiments, the soils were amended with different rates of a lupin green manure (4 or 8t dry matter per ha), and different forms of N at 100 kg per ha (urea and lupin) and incubated for 3 months. Samples were taken periodically, and in addition to soil biological properties and community structure, gross N mineralisation was determined. The form of N had a strong effect on microbial soil properties. Organic amendment resulted in a 2 to 5-fold increase in microbial biomass and enzyme activities, while microbial community structure was influenced by the addition or lack of C or N substrate. Correlation analyses suggested treatment-related differences in nutrient availability, microbial structural diversity (species richness or evenness) and physiological properties of the microbial community. The findings of this thesis showed that using green manures and crop rotations improved soil biology in both production systems, that no relationships existed between microbial structure, enzyme activities and N mineralisation, and that enzyme activities and microbial community structure are more closely associated with inherent soil and environmental factors, which makes them less useful as early indicators of changes in soil quality.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microbial community structure</field><field name="subject">soil biology</field><field name="subject">soil processes</field><field name="subject">function</field><field name="subject">past and current management</field><field name="subject">organic and conventional farming practices</field><field name="subject">lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) green manure</field><field name="subject">urea</field><field name="subject">intact monolith lysimeters</field><field name="subject">N dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20070220.010748/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The analysis of permutations</field><field name="creator">Dansie, B.

From each of six lines, 30 genotypes were clonally progagated into five diverse edaphic and altitudinal sites and grown for one season. Comparisons of growth and form were also made between T. ambiguum, T. repens cv. 'Grasslands Huia' and Lotus pedunculatus cv. 'Grasslands Maku'. The polyploid lines were found to have larger leaves than the diploids while all the lines of T. ambiguum had larger leaves than did white clover. Tetraploid lines had longer petioles and were taller and more erect than the diploids or hexaploids. Floral initiation was found to become later as ploidy level increased but the tetraploid lines exhibited a very large variation in flowering date. The cultivar Treeline was found to produce the most herbage under all conditions although not significantly more than cultivar Prairie or C.P.I. 57353. However, as nodulation was not studied it was not possible to determine whether variety differences were due to root nodulating ability or some other genetically determined parameter. None of the T. ambiguum varieties produced as much herbage as cv. Huia or cv. Maku at any site. However, all the T. ambiguum lines performed relatively better under harsher conditions. Because a large proportion of T. ambiguum was below ground the best T. ambiguum line, cultivar Treeiine, produced equivalent total plant dry weight to cv. Huia and cv. Maku at 1200 m. a.s.l., the high altitude site. Cultivar Prairie was found to have the highest proportion of rhizomes to total plant mass bu because cv. Treeline had higher total plant dry weight both cultivars produced equivalent mean rhizome dry weight. The number of rhizomes, number of daughter plants and rhizome dry weight were all highly correlated and these three characteristics showed similar trends among varieties. Rhizome length was found to increase with ploidy level, as did rhizome internode length. However, the number of nodes was found to be higher in the diploids than in the polyploids. Cultivar Treeline was found to have a high proportion of branching nodes on its rhizomes while C.P.I. 57353 and cv. Summit had the least. Rhizome production was restricted in the Wakanui silt loam soil of high bulk density. However, herbage growth and rhizome branching was increased, probably because of the higher fertility. It was shown using factor analysis on genotypic correlations, that rhizome characteristics and herbage yields were relatively independently inherited. However, morphological characters tended to be related to herbage yields. The polyploid varieties were found to be more genetically variable than the diploids . Broad sense heritabilities were calculated for all parameters measured, and in general, morphological characteristics had higher values than agronomic characteristics. As the genetic variation within each line was higher than the variation among lines, it is apparent that selection within lines should result in the largest gains. Therefore, comparison of the mean performance of the presently highly variable lines is relatively uninformative. By sacrificing some genetic diversity, large gains could be made in performance. It is suggested that cv. Prairie be used as the basis for selecting a highly rhizomatous cultivar while cv. Treeline could be used in the selection of a cultivar with higher herbage production suitable for high country conditions. In a second trial, an established stand of cv. Treeline produced up to 13250 kg per ha for one season under good growing conditions. The management required to produce this amount of herbage was to irrigate and cut to ground level every two months. The growth rate was considerably depressed when cut monthly. It was also shown that root and rhizome yield reached 12600 kg per ha, indicating a massive reserve of assimilates, particularly useful for surviving periods of stress. Seed yields were found to be adequate, reaching levels equivalent to 500-700 kg per ha. These results were discussed in relation to earlier observations on T. ambiguum by workers in Russia, Australia, U.S.A. and New Zealand. Suggestions were made for further genetic and agronomic testing.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trifolium ambiguum</field><field name="subject">genetic variation</field><field name="subject">morphology</field><field name="subject">seed production</field><field name="subject">flowering</field><field name="subject">rhizome</field><field name="subject">herbage production</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20070921.150303/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plant breeding aspects of ryegrasses (Lolium sp.) infected with endophytic fungi</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Alan V.</field><field name="description">Some aspects of the presence of systemic endophytic fungi in agriculturally important New Zealand grasses were studied in relation to plant breeding. Seedling resistance to adult Argentine stem weevil feeding in perennial ryegrass, Italian ryegrass and tall fescue was found to be related to the presence of their respective Acremonium endophytes in the seed rather than to plant genetic resistance. In addition a study of perennial ryegrass revealed that this resistance was independent of endophyte viability. The seedling resistance conferred by the endophyte of Italian ryegrass was found to be beneficial for field establishment. This endophyte differs from that in perennial ryegrass and tall fescue in that it does not confer resistance to Argentine stem weevil on mature plants, but only on seedlings. The extent of plant genetic seedling tolerance to adult Argentine stem weevil feeding was limited to broad inter-specific differences, with tall fescue more tolerant than perennial ryegrass and both of these more tolerant than Italian ryegrass. This ranking corresponds with previous observations on feeding preference on mature plants. A study of factors affecting the concentration of endophyte mycelia in infected seed of perennial ryegrass revealed that plant genetic factors had little effect. The major factors studied were: 1) the endophyte concentration in the maternal parent plant directly influenced the endophyte concentration in the seed. 2) nitrogen fertilizer applications to a seed crop reduced the concentration of mycelia in the seed, with earlier applications having a greater effect. 3) application of the fungicide propiconazole (Tilt) to a seed crop reduced the endophyte concentration in the seed. 4) the endophyte concentration in the seed was found to directly influence the endophyte concentration in seedlings, six month old plants and that of seed harvested from a first year seed crop. As there have been no previous reports of tetraploid perennial ryegrass cultivars with endophyte an experiment was conducted to determine if these could be developed by the standard procedure of colchicine treatment. The results revealed that endophyte was retained following colchicine treatment.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ryegrass</field><field name="subject">Lolium</field><field name="subject">endophyte</field><field name="subject">Acremonium</field><field name="subject">seedling resistance</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">fungicide</field><field name="subject">tetraploid</field><field name="subject">Argentine stem weevil</field><field name="subject">Listronotus</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20071005.172250/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Determinants of FDI and FPI in Thailand: a Gravity Model Analysis</field><field name="creator">Thanyakhan, Sutana</field><field name="description">Thailand has been one of significant recipients of foreign direct investment (FDI) among
developing countries over the last 30 years, and has recorded rapid and sustained growth
rates in a number of different industrial categories. Thailand has shown a clear policy
transition for foreign investment over time from an import-substitution regime to an
export-oriented regime. Before the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis (1985-1996), Thailand had
the fastest growing level of exports in manufactured goods among Asian economies. FDI
plays a significant role in the Thai economy. Thailand has been pursuing different foreign
investment policies at different times depending on the development objectives and
economic situation in the country.
The main objective of this research is to evaluate the determinants of FDI and foreign
portfolio investment (FPI) in Thailand using the extended Gravity Model. Panel data is
used to estimate and evaluate the empirical results based on the data for the years 1980 to
2004. It also examines the FDI flows between different locations and their geographical
distances in Thailand. The primary research question addresses what factors motivate,
attract, and sustain the FDI and FPI in Thailand. In addition, this study also examines the
effects of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis on the inflows of FDI and FPI into Thailand.
The results show that the inflows of FDI in Thailand, which are supply-driven, are
significantly influenced by its 21 largest investing partners. The 1997 Asian Financial
Crisis has no impact on the determinants of the inflows of FDI into Thailand, but positively
influences the inflows of FPI into Thailand. Our results also show that increases in GDP
and trade between investing partners and Thailand potentially attract more FDI and FPI
into Thailand. Investing partners closer to Thailand draw more portfolio investment into Thailand than distant partners &#150; emphasising that distance has a negative impact on the
portfolio investment but a negligible impact on the FDI.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">FDI</field><field name="subject">FPI</field><field name="subject">portfolio investment</field><field name="subject">Gravity Model</field><field name="subject">Asian Financial Crisis</field><field name="subject">regional integration</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080429.102238/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploratory study to identify the concerns that New Zealand consumers have about business-to-consumer e-commerce</field><field name="creator">Trent, Miles John Wedderburn</field><field name="description">To date much of the literature on consumers&#146; concerns about business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce has described findings from quantitative research.   As a result, much of that literature has focused on specific previously-identified concerns (e.g., privacy of personal information, use of credit cards for on-line payment).   Also, there has been little research into the concerns of New Zealand consumers, and all of it has been quantitative.

In order to gain a broader understanding, this study took a qualitative approach.   Three focus groups were conducted, in order to identify consumers&#146; concerns.   The concerns that were thus identified were combined with those that a review of the literature had previously identified, and were used to draw up a set of guidelines to be used in semi-structured interviews.   Fifteen interviews were then conducted, in order to gain consumers&#146; views about each concern.

It seems that at a higher level, consumer&#146;s concerns have shifted.   The literature suggests that in the past consumers&#146; concerns about Internet shopping have focused on the fact that Internet shopping is conducted via the Internet &#150; as a result of which consumers have, for example, been concerned about the privacy of their personal information ('if I give them my e-mail address, will I get spam?')

This study suggests that now consumers&#146; concerns focus on the fact that Internet shopping is a form of shopping &#150; as a result of which they are now only prepared to use the Web sites of 'reputable companies', and they now require to be able to evaluate an item adequately before buying it.   And it seems that another result of this is that consumers now expect that the 'reputable companies' whose Web sites they visit will &#150; as a matter of course - address to their satisfaction issues such as the privacy of their personal information.

While there are some types of products that consumers are prepared to buy on-line (e.g., air travel), there are many about which they are reluctant.   Concerns were expressed about a wide range of potential purchases, and for a variety of reasons;  also, some data was inconsistent (for example, some consumers were not prepared to buy clothes on-line, but others were).   This appears to be an area in which consumer attitudes are still evolving.   It is suggested that it may be helpful for further research on this matter to consider both demographic factors and the degree of consumer involvement in particular types of purchases.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">B2C e-commerce</field><field name="subject">consumer behaviour</field><field name="subject">consumer involvement</field><field name="subject">e-commerce</field><field name="subject">Internet shopping</field><field name="subject">perceived risk</field><field name="subject">shopping on-line</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080407.122132/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supply chains behaving badly : a dynamic model of inter-organisational supply chain exchange behaviour under rational, relational and chaotic paradigms</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Mark M. J.</field><field name="description">Supply chain exchange relationships are complex and sometimes chaotic sociological and organisational phenomena. This complexity is compounded by the boundary spanning necessity of forming supply chain partnerships that are further exacerbated by goal divergence and asymmetric information. One of the main questions for consideration is how these dyadic exchange relationships are maintained and develop over time in response to the various channel behaviours of the actors (the buyer and seller)? In particular, exchange relationships are theorised to be sensitive in some degree to attempts at economic appropriation, and conversely coordinative efforts. Such efforts manifest themselves into the mutually opposing forces broadly labelled as opportunistic and collaborative behavioural paradigms. Drawing from the concepts of Systems and Chaos/Complexity theories, it is theorised that the movement from one form of relational arrangement to another is enacted in a non-linear and dynamic manner with periods of relational equilibrium disrupted by bifurcations resulting in the emergence of new levels of relationship. However, not all exchange relationships are susceptible to constant change, rather, there should be some threshold barrier or relationship inertia that must be overcome before a bifurcation occurs. Yet what is not known is how strong these bonds are to the enactment of opportunistic and collaborative partner behaviours. Hence, 189 manufacturing supply chain relationships were survey-interviewed in order to determine the impact that collaborative and opportunistic behaviours have on supply chain relational movement. The results show that generally exchange relationships do in fact change in response to these enacted behaviours, and that actual levels of supply chain behaviour over a range of 12 variables could be measured. Indeed, the level of opportunistic behaviour experienced by the sample was disturbing. In addition, the level of tolerance (zone of tolerance) for specific behaviours was measured for the first time in the field. Overall, it was found that supply chain exchange relationships do indeed evolve in a non-linear dynamic manner in response to opportunistic and collaborative manoeuvres by the dyadic actors. Finally, these ideas were summarised in the Dynamic Relational Development (DRD) concept that explains how supply chain relationships dynamically change. In addition, the dualistic nature of the collaborative versus opportunistic behaviour choice for exchange actors is tentatively reconciled by the deontological approach of the Supply Chain Citizen theory offered in this research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">supply chain management</field><field name="subject">dynamic</field><field name="subject">exchange</field><field name="subject">relationships</field><field name="subject">movement</field><field name="subject">opportunism</field><field name="subject">collaboration</field><field name="subject">relational and rational schools</field><field name="subject">chaos and complexity theory</field><field name="subject">DRD concept</field><field name="subject">Supply Chain Citizen theory</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080229.095848/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The operation and effectiveness of formal and informal supply chains for fresh produce in the Papua New Guinea highlands</field><field name="creator">Worinu, Mark</field><field name="description">The research aim was to gain a more detailed understanding of the operation of different key segments for fresh produce supply chains originating in the Highlands Provinces in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The research investigates a number of supply chain dimensions of effectiveness which include, value creation and integration of processes, logistics, quality, information, relationship/vertical integration and overall effectiveness. These were linked together in SC framework. Two potato chains were investigated, one formal, the other informal. The informal potato chain involves small holder farmers, input suppliers and local markets including kai bars and the urban market. The chain originates and ends within the Western Highlands Province. The formal potato chain has farmers, input suppliers, wholesaler/marker, transport companies (trucking and coastal shipping agents), supermarkets, hotels and kai bars. This chain originates in Mt Hagen, Western Highlands Province and ends in Port Moresby, National Capital District. The effectiveness of both the formal and informal chains was identified, and comparisons were made to see how each chain differed. The informal chain was found to have different problems to the formal chains. However, participants to both chains demonstrate a high entrepreneurial behavior. A key finding of the study was that the chains spread their risk by operating in multiple market segments and this can help to solve issues with variable quality. The marketers in each chain position themselves in these different market segments. It was clear from this work that focusing on functions and not the whole chain can lead to a distorted view of chain performance. For example, for the informal chain, a focus on logistics issues, particularly poor roads and problems with availability of seeds, can misrepresent the effectiveness of this chain. Therefore, it was concluded that it is important to look at the overall performance of each chain rather than looking specifically at particular chain functions in isolation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Supply Chain management</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea supply chains</field><field name="subject">formal chains</field><field name="subject">informal chains</field><field name="subject">case study</field><field name="subject">smallholder farmer</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080318.100431/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling genetic regulatory networks: a new model for circadian rhythms in Drosophila and investigation of genetic noise in a viral infection process</field><field name="creator">Xie, Zhi</field><field name="description">In spite of remarkable progress in molecular biology, our understanding of the dynamics and functions of intra- and inter-cellular biological networks has been hampered by their complexity. Kinetics modelling, an important type of mathematical modelling, provides a rigorous and reliable way to reveal the complexity of biological networks. In this thesis, two genetic regulatory networks have been investigated via kinetic models. 

In the first part of the study, a model is developed to represent the transcriptional regulatory network essential for the circadian rhythms in Drosophila. The model incorporates the transcriptional feedback loops revealed so far in the network of the circadian clock (PER/TIM and VRI/PDP1 loops). Conventional Hill functions are not used to describe the regulation of genes, instead the explicit reactions of binding and unbinding processes of transcription factors to promoters are modelled. The model is described by a set of ordinary differential equations and the parameters are estimated from the in vitro experimental data of the clocks&#146; components. The simulation results show that the model reproduces sustained circadian oscillations in mRNA and protein concentrations that are in agreement with experimental observations. It also simulates the entrainment by light-dark cycles, the disappearance of the rhythmicity in constant light and the shape of phase response curves resembling that of experimental results. The model is robust over a wide range of parameter variations. In addition, the simulated E-box mutation, perS and perL mutants are similar to that observed in the experiments. The deficiency between the simulated mRNA levels and experimental observations in per01, tim01 and clkJrk mutants suggests some differences in the model from reality. Finally, a possible function of VRI/PDP1 loops is proposed to increase the robustness of the clock. 

In the second part of the study, the sources of intrinsic noise and the influence of extrinsic noise are investigated on an intracellular viral infection system. The contribution of the intrinsic noise from each reaction is measured by means of a special form of stochastic differential equation, the chemical Langevin equation. The intrinsic noise of the system is the linear sum of the noise in each of the reactions. The intrinsic noise arises mainly from the degradation of mRNA and the transcription processes. Then, the effects of extrinsic noise are studied by means of a general form of stochastic differential equation. It is found that the noise of the viral components grows logarithmically with increasing noise intensities. The system is most susceptible to noise in the virus assembly process. A high level of noise in this process can even inhibit the replication of the viruses.

In summary, the success of this thesis demonstrates the usefulness of models for interpreting experimental data, developing hypotheses, as well as for understanding the design principles of genetic regulatory networks.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">systems biology</field><field name="subject">genetic regulatory networks</field><field name="subject">mathematical molecular modelling</field><field name="subject">kinetic modelling</field><field name="subject">Hill function</field><field name="subject">stochastic modelling</field><field name="subject">stochastic differential equations</field><field name="subject">chemical Langevin equation</field><field name="subject">oscillations</field><field name="subject">circadian clock</field><field name="subject">circadian rhythms</field><field name="subject">Drosophila</field><field name="subject">intrinsic noise</field><field name="subject">extrinsic noise</field><field name="subject">viral infection</field><field name="subject">virus replication</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20070712.144258/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model system using insects to vector Fusarium tumidum for biological control of gorse (Ulex europaeus)</field><field name="creator">Yamoah, Emmanuel</field><field name="description">The overall objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that insects can vector F.
tumidum conidia to infect gorse plants with the aim of developing an alternative approach to mycoherbicide delivery to control weeds. Four potential insect species (Apion ulicis, Cydia ulicetana, Epiphyas postvittana and Sericothrips staphylinus) were assessed for their ability to vector F. tumidum conidia. To achieve this, the external microflora (bacteria and fungi) and the size and location of fungal spores on the cuticle of these insect species were determined. In addition, the ability of the insects to pick up and deposit F. tumidum conidia on agar was studied. Based on the results from these
experiments, E. postvittana was selected for more detailed experiments to determine transmission of F. tumidum to infect potted gorse plants. The factors promoting pathogenicity of F. tumidum against gorse and the pathogen loading required to infect and kill the weed were also determined.
The external microflora of the four insect species were recovered by washing and plating
techniques and identified by morphology and polymerase chain reaction restriction
fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and sequencing of internally transcribed
spacer (ITS) and 16S rDNA. A culture-independent technique (direct PCR) was also used
to assess fungal diversity by direct amplification of ITS sequences from the washings of the insects. All insect species carried Alternaria, Cladosporium, Nectria, Penicillium,
Phoma, Pseudozyma spp. and entomopathogens. Ninety four per cent of the 178 cloned
amplicons had ITS sequences similarity to Nectria mauritiicola. E. postvittana carried the
largest fungal spores (mean surface area of 125.9 &#236;m2) and the most fungal CFU/insect.
About 70% of the fungi isolated from the insects were also present on the host plant
(gorse) and the understorey grass. The mean size of fungal spores recovered from the
insect species correlated strongly with their body length (R&#178; = 85%). Methylobacterium
aquaticum and Pseudomonas lutea were common on all four insect species.
Pseudomonas fluorescens was the most abundant bacterial species.
In the pathogenicity trials, the effectiveness of F. tumidum in reducing root and shoot
biomass of 16 and 8 wk old gorse plants was significantly increased with wounding of the
plants. Older plants (32 wk old) which were wounded and inoculated were significantly
shorter, more infected and developed more tip dieback (80%) than plants which were not
wounded (32%). This indicates that damage caused by phytophagous insect species
present on gorse through feeding and oviposition may enhance infection by F. tumidum.
Wounding may release nutrients (e.g. Mg and Zn) essential for conidia germination and
germ tube elongation and also provide easier access for germ tube penetration. Conidial
germination and germ tube length were increased by 50 and 877%, respectively when
incubated in 0.2% of gorse extract solution for 24 h compared with incubation in water.
Inoculum suspensions amended with 0.2% of gorse extract caused more infection and
significantly reduced biomass production of 24 wk old gorse plants than suspensions
without gorse extract. A minimum number of about 900 viable conidia/infection site of F.
tumidum were required to infect gorse leaves. However, incorporation of amendments
(which can injure the leaf cuticle) or provision of nutrients (i.e. gorse extract or glucose)
in the formulation might decrease the number of conidia required for lesion formation.
Scanning electron micrographs showed that germ tube penetration of gorse tissue was
limited to open stomata which partly explain the large number of conidia required for
infection. The flowers and leaves were more susceptible to F. tumidum infection than the
spines, stems and pods. An experiment to determine the number of infection sites
required to cause plant mortality showed that the entire plant needs to be inoculated in
order for the pathogen to kill 10 wk old plants as F. tumidum is a non systemic pathogen.
The number of infection sites correlated strongly with disease severity (R&#178; = 99.3%). At
least 50% of the plant was required to be inoculated to cause a significant reduction in
shoot dry weight. F. tumidum, applied as soil inoculant using inoculated wheat grains in three separate experiments, significantly suppressed gorse seedling emergence and biomass production.
In experiments to determine the loading capacity of the insect species, E. postvittana, the
largest insect species studied, carried significantly more (68) and deposited significantly more (29) F. tumidum conidia than the other species. Each E. postvittana, loaded with 5,000 conidia of F. tumidum, transmitted approximately 310 conidia onto gorse plants but
this did not cause any infection or affect plant growth as determined by shoot fresh
weight and shoot height. E. postvittana on its own did not cause any significant damage
to gorse and did not enhance F. tumidum infection. It also failed to spread the pathogen
from infected plants to the healthy ones. There was no evidence of synergism between the
two agents and damage caused by the combination of both E. postvittana and F. tumidum
was equivalent to that caused by F. tumidum alone.
This study has shown that E. postvittana has the greatest capacity to vector F. tumidum
since it naturally carried the largest and the most fungal spores (429 CFU/insect).
Moreover, it naturally carried Fusarium spp. such as F. lateritium, F. tricinctum and
Gibberella pulicaris (anamorph Fusarium sambucinum) and was capable of carrying and
depositing most F. tumidum conidia on agar. Coupled with the availability of pheromone
for attracting the male insects, E. postvittana may be a suitable insect vector for
delivering F. tumidum conidia on gorse using this novel biocontrol strategy. Although it
is a polyphagous insect, and may visit non-target plants, F. tumidum is a very specific
pathogen of gorse, broom and a few closely related plant species. Hence, using this insect
species to vector F. tumidum in a biological control programme, should not pose a
significant threat to plants of economic importance. However, successful control of gorse
using this "lure-load-infect" concept would depend, to a large extent on the virulence of
the pathogen as insects, due to the large size of F. tumidum macroconidia, can carry only
a small number of it.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fusarium tumidum</field><field name="subject">insect microflora</field><field name="subject">PCR-RFLP</field><field name="subject">ITS</field><field name="subject">16S rDNA</field><field name="subject">mycoherbicide</field><field name="subject">gorse</field><field name="subject">biological control</field><field name="subject">wounding</field><field name="subject">insect vectors</field><field name="subject">lure-load-infect</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.lincoln.ac.nz/public/adt-NZLIU20080131.114607/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The social organization of a secondhand clothing store : informal strategies and social interaction amongst volunteer workers</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Marlene.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves [282]-290.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Women in charitable work South Australia</field><field name="subject">Women Social networks</field><field name="subject">Social structure South Australia</field><field name="subject">Teams in the workplace</field><field name="subject">Social exchange</field><field name="subject">Power (Social sciences)</field><field name="subject">Polarization (Social sciences)</field><field name="subject">Endowments Officials and employees</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phe2655.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:5936866</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asset revaluation and future firm operating performance: evidence from New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhai, Yong Hong</field><field name="description">The regulatory framework of many countries allows the upward revaluation of assets.

A specific meta-epistemological method is posed for the transformation of legal domain epistemology to large scale legal expert systems; the method has five stages: 1. domain epistemology; 2. computational domain epistemology; 3. shell epistemology; 4. programming epistemology; and 5. application epistemology and ontology. The nature of legal epistemology is defined in terms of a deep model that divides the information of the ontology of legal possibilities into the three sorts of logic premises, namely, (1) rules of law for extended deduction, (2) material facts of cases for induction that establishes rule antecedents, and (3) reasons for rules, including justifications, explanations or criticisms of rules, for abduction. Extended deduction is distinguished for automation, and provides a map for locating, relatively, associated induction and abduction. Added to this is a communication system that involves issues of cognition and justice in the legal system. The Appendix sets out a sample of draft rule maps of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, known as the Vienna Convention, to illustrate that the substantive epistemology of the international law can be mapped to the generic epistemology of the shell. This thesis deflects the ontological solution back to the earlier rule-based, case-based and logic advances, with a definition of artificial legal intelligence that rests on legal epistemology; added to the definition is a transparent communication system of a user interface, including an interactive visualisation of rule maps, and the heuristics that process input and produce output to give effect to the legal intelligence of an application. The additions include an epistemological use of the ontology of legal possibilities to complete legal logic, for the purposes of processing specific legal applications. While the specific meta-epistemological methodology distinguishes domain epistemology from the epistemologies of artificial legal intelligence, namely computational domain epistemology, program design epistemology, programming epistemology and application epistemology, the prototypes illustrate the use of those distinctions, and the synthesis effected by that use. The thesis develops the Jurisprudence of Legal Knowledge Engineering by an artificial metaphysics.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="subject">artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">information</field><field name="subject">retrieval systems</field><field name="subject">legal domain epistemology</field><field name="subject">legal expert systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/20012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pleasant charge : William Blake's multiple roles for women</field><field name="creator">Hood, Margaret Anne.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 421-464.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Blake, William, 1757-1827 Characters Women</field><field name="subject">Sex role in literature</field><field name="subject">Women in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phh777.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:5936870</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probabilistic Human-Robot Information Fusion</field><field name="creator">Kaupp, Tobias</field><field name="description">PhD</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human-robot interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/2554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender in the Fifty-first New South Wales Parliament</field><field name="creator">Smith, Anthony Russell</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New South Wales.

Research in environmental education since this time has established the justification for its existence in the formal curriculum of schools. Less research has been conducted on the actual pedagogy of environmental education. This forms one part of the justification for this research study. The other justification for this research study is school students' objectification of the environment evidenced from the findings of a large survey of NSW school students. The objectification of the environment finding referred to students' responses that suggested that the environment was separate from them in contrast to a minority of students' responses that referred to a relational view (Loughland, Reid, Walker &amp; Petocz, 2003). The two foci of pedagogy and students' understandings of the environment come together in the research question of this thesis, what is the relation between pedagogy and representations of the environment in environmental education?  A Bernsteinian model of pedagogy, the pedagogical device, underpins the theoretical analysis of the pedagogy of environmental education in this study (Bernstein, 1990). A particular aspect of this device, the pedagogic recontextualising field, is used as a framework of analysis for the exposition of the major influences on the development of pedagogy of environmental education in NSW. Another theory of pedagogy, the NSW Quality Teaching Framework, is used to offer a performative angle on pedagogy to provide theoretical triangulation for the study.  The pedagogy of environmental education was examined through a classroom ethnography with the researcher acting as a participant observer. The data were in the form of field notes, curriculum materials including children's literature, transcripts of classroom learning and products of students' learning. The analysis of the data was conducted using a variety of methods of analysis. The data were initially coded for themes that were the different representations of the environment in the pedagogy of this classroom. Further, the NSW Quality Teaching Framework (NSW DET 2003) was used as a theoretical framework of analysis in order to examine the data from the perspective of student performance in relation to current understandings of what constitutes good pedagogical practice. Next, Bernstein's model of the pedagogic device (1990) was used to analyse the data in the larger context of the social construction of knowledge in the school curriculum. This analysis incorporated  Bernstein's original notions of pedagogical classification and framing (1971). This study has two main findings. First, the pedagogy of environmental education has strong classification and framing (after Bernstein 1971) that supports the objectification of the environment. Second, there is also some weak framing of the pedagogy of environmental education that generally does not support the objectification of the environment. The implications for these findings for practice are that environmental educators should be aware of deterministic curriculum that seeks to impose one view of the environment onto students. This curriculum positions the environment as an object that needs to be saved through human intervention. Further research into the pedagogy of environmental education that explores the relation of students' understandings of the environment and their relation to the epistemological and theoretical bases of pedagogy is warranted as a result of this study.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pedagogy</field><field name="subject">environmental</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">Bernsteinian</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Model Reduction of Large Structural Systems for Active Vibration Control</field><field name="creator">Boffa, John</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the applicability of the Dynamic model reduction method that is used for direct plant order reduction in the active vibration control of large and flexible structures. A comparison of the performances between the reduced models produced by the Dynamic model reduction method and those obtained by other common model reduction methods such as the Guyan method, and the Mode-displacement method have been carried out. By using a full analytical model of a twenty storey building as the reference, each three degrees of freedom model was compared by computer simulation.  The open-loop frequency response simulation, open-loop earthquake simulation, and the closed-loop earthquake simulation were all used to initially evaluate the reduced models. The accuracy of the frequency responses was assessed with sinusoidal applied forces, and for the closed-loop dynamic analysis, an active mass damper at the top storey and a recorded earthquake excitation was used. When compared with the simulation results of the Guyan method, the Dynamic method has many advantages, especially in terms of its accuracy at the high frequency range. The Mode-displacement method produces reduced models that are good for dynamic analysis of open-loop systems, but it was found to be inconvenient for use in active control. Finally, the Dynamic model reduction method and Guyan method were compared using experimental test results. A 2.5m tall building model with 20 floors was used as the plant, with a linear motor installed at the top storey for the purposes of active-damping.  Although the results of simulations would suggest that both models perform sufficiently, experimental testing proved that only the Dynamic model performs adequately for this specific application of active control. The problem associated with most model reduction methods, such as the Guyan, is that they are based on full-order models that were derived from the linear elastic theory. The versatility of the Dynamic model reduction method is such that it provides the option of obtaining system parameters directly from experiment, not just from theory. The experimental procedure ensures that the Dynamic model reduction method forms an accurate description of the real system dynamics. The applicability of this method for obtaining low-order plant models was demonstrated through real-time active control testing of the model structure, while it was subject to a sinusoidal excitation. The tests have shown that the Dynamic model reduction method can be used as an alternative approach for the model reduction of structural systems for the purpose of active vibration control.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vibration control.</field><field name="subject">Buildings vibration.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Labour</field><field name="creator">Duff, Margaret</field><field name="description">The partograph, developed over 50 years ago and based on research conducted by Friedman (1954, 1955 &amp; 1956), has been promoted by the World Health Organisation as the &#8220;gold&#8221; standard for assessing progress in labour. The basic premise of the partograph is that regular vaginal examinations throughout labour that calculate the extent and rate of cervical dilation will be the most reliable indicator of labour progress.  A review of the medical and midwifery literature suggested that the progress of labour can also be assessed by observing women&#8217;s behavioural responses to labour. This study set out to describe and test the reliability and consistency of these behavioural cues. These cues were derived from published literature and used to construct a &#8220;Labour Assessment Tool&#8221; (LAT). The LAT was tested and modified using an expert reference group and results of a pilot test. Inter-rater reliability was established during the pilot study and verified with other experienced midwives as data collectors. The LAT recorded partograph observations as well as labour behaviours.  The study was undertaken in two Australian hospitals between 1999 and 2002. Women were given information on the study during regular antenatal visits to the hospitals from 30 weeks gestation and invited to participate during one of their antenatal visits between 37 weeks and 42 weeks of pregnancy. There were 21 women of the 225 women approached who declined to participate. The LAT observations were recorded on 203 participants however only 179 participants (94 nulliparous and 85 multiparous women) who generated 47,768 individual observations were suitable for analysis. There were 59 participants (31 nulliparous and 28 multiparous women) who were induced into labour or had their labours augmented. Women excluded from the study included those with complications of pregnancy and labour. Women were also withdrawn from the study at the time an epidural was commenced but their data to that point were retained for analysis.  The data were examined from three perspectives. The first was from a &#8216;phases of labour&#8217; perspective based on the work of Friedman (1954; 1955). Data obtained at the time the women had an internal cervical assessment were allocated to early labour, active labour, transition or full dilation, based on the results of the cervical measurements. The second perspective examined all the descriptors over the course of labour from admission to hospital or the beginning of an induction of labour, to second stage of labour. Frequencies were again generated for each behaviour from admission to hospital until full dilation. They were compared to the mean dilation generated for both parity groups based on the 279 cervical examinations that were performed on the participants. The third perspective examined behavioural patterns observed within each woman&#8217;s labour unrelated to the time to full dilation or Friedman&#8217;s phases of labour model.  Results indicate that specific behavioural descriptors associated with progress were observed before cervical dilation increased. Descriptors indicating cervical dilation was occurring, or had occurred, and descriptors indicating impending second stage as well as second stage itself, were identified. Differences were observed between the labours of multiparous and nulliparous women and induced labours and non induced labours.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Labor (Obstetrics)</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Childbirth</field><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mothers and school choice: effects on the home front</field><field name="creator">Aitchison, Claire</field><field name="description">There have been substantial changes in the way that families interact with schooling at the point of school choice. These shifts have been brought about by market orientated educational policy changes, and by altered forms and experiences of &#8216;family&#8217;. This study explores this changed dynamic by researching how a group of mothers in one urban setting engaged in school choice over a period of fourteen months. The research set out to investigate the processes, behaviours and influences that mothers took to the task of choosing secondary schooling for their children. In particular it aimed to explore the personal, familial, cultural and social dimensions of this engagement. These objectives were pursued using feminist and phenomenological frames because these theoretical approaches allowed for a gendered and contextualised analysis of experience. Data was gathered longitudinally through return interviews with 20 women from one socially and culturally diverse local government area in Sydney, Australia. The analysis of data is informed by perspectives on markets and consumerism from the field of cultural studies. Bourdieu&#8217;s concepts of &#8216;capital&#8217;, &#8216;habitus&#8217; and &#8216;field&#8217; were also used along with the feminist concepts of &#8216;emotional labour&#8217; and &#8216;emotional capital&#8217; to analyse the way that neoliberal market orientated educational policies impacted on this group of middle Australians. This research shows that the Australian experience of school choice is an emotionally rich, highly context-specific, complex, gendered and cooperative process that contests the prevailing public rhetoric about the operations of markets and of choice. School choice, while not always welcomed by this group of middle Australians, is an overtly gendered activity mostly overseen and undertaken by mothers in gender-specific ways. For these women school choice was an activity that demanded considerable physical and emotional labouring adding significantly to mothers&#8217; work in support of their children&#8217;s education. Further, the research showed how within this new marketised context, the family became the site for the contestation of taste via the negotiation of differing economic, social, cultural and emotional capitals vis a vis the structural imperatives imposed by the market. It showed that for these women and their families in this location, at this time, the promise of &#8216;choice&#8217; was a hollow promise indeed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School choice.</field><field name="subject">Feminism.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discourse and desire in a second language classroom</field><field name="creator">Ellwood, Constance</field><field name="description">This thesis draws on the theories of Foucault, and Deleuze and Guattari to describe some ways in which teacher and student identities are produced and performed in a second language classroom. Three major aspects of identity are considered: cultural identity, teacher professional role identity, and the changing identity of the language learner.  The thesis uses poststructuralist perspectives to critique notions of identity current in second language theory and practice. It extends the conception of identity as 'subjectivity&#8217; proposed by Bonny Norton Peirce - that is, as multiple, impermanent, fragmented &#8211; to include the notion of subjectivity produced in interaction and desire. Through an examination of texts produced in an ethnographic study, the thesis addresses issues of cultural categorisation and stereotyping in second language teaching and learning. It discusses the discursive production of subjectivity in discourses of cultural identity and the extent to which culture is a determining factor in subjectivity in the classroom site of the research. It shows how a homogenising effect of discourse leads to the positioning, both self-imposed and other-imposed, of individuals as members of particular cultural groups with particular characteristics. The thesis also discusses the discursive production of subjectivity through discourses of good teacher and good student, and demonstrates the extent to which these discourses are processes of molarisation. The thesis is thus concerned here with an examination of relatively static, fixed identifications and to demonstrate the power of discourse to determine subjectivities. It is also concerned to look at an excess to discourse, a flow which is beyond signification and identification: desire. Identity change at the discursive level is discussed through discourses of becoming, and is differentiated from movements away from subjectification. These movements of desire are proposed as a new way of conceiving agency.  The thesis attempts to show some ways in which these subjectivities, produced in discourse and desire, play out in the classroom, in terms of their production and reception by participants, and the impacts on the teaching/learning context.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">second language</field><field name="subject">classroom</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Celebrations for personal and collective health and wellbeing.</field><field name="creator">Hilbers, Julieanne.</field><field name="description">Celebrations are pervasive.  At a personal level they include birthdays, funerals, weddings, get-togethers, award ceremonies, and parties organised for any number of reasons.  At a community level they include faith-based services, public holidays, commemorations and community festivals.  These are just a selection.  I argue that there is a need to better understand what role celebrations can play to improve health and wellbeing and not just for individuals but for communities. In this thesis I examine the experiences, context, processes and politics of celebrations and how they contribute to both personal and collective health and wellbeing.  Of course, some celebrations make a more meaningful contribution than others.  And it is the nature of that difference I seek to understand.  The two leading research questions I address are:  &#8226;	How do celebrations contribute to personal and collective health and wellbeing? &#8226;	What is &#8216;healthy&#8217; celebration practice?  There are three sections in this thesis.  In the first I describe and discuss the Australian context of celebration activities.  I also explore definitions of celebrations.  I consider celebrations to be an active process made up of both play and ritual.  Celebrations seek to focus people&#8217;s attention, and intention, in a positive way.  The resulting celebratory act(s) are a cultural expression of what a particular individual or community values.  There are a diversity of celebration forms and practices - open, spontaneous, planned and formal.  Each celebration is influenced by, and influences, the context in which it occurs.  I will be focusing on celebrations occurring within a community context.  A community may be a family, an organization, local community, shared interest group or a whole of society grouping.  In the second section of the thesis I analyse the relationship of celebrations to various dimensions of health and wellbeing.  These dimensions include: social connectedness, identity, transitions and lifespan development, and community capacity.  A major part of my fieldwork was undertaken in Victoria where I studied 20 community celebrations.  The community celebrations I examined in varying degrees, did positively contribute to personal and collective wellbeing.  They did so because they included positive and personally meaningful activities.  They explored identity.  Celebrations played a role in supporting transitions leading to ongoing healthy development.  They provided opportunities for learning; not just knowledge but allowed values to be explored and skills and resources to be gained.  They brought people together to interact and fostered a sense of belonging.  Celebrations that were health enhancing valued diversity but also explored what unites people.  My research confirmed that celebrations can foster our connections; to ourselves, others, the earth, time and the spiritual.  They can build relationships between individuals, groups and organizations.  They can be spaces that allow for personal and collective healing. But the degree to which these positive dimensions can be achieved depends on the nature or quality of the celebration practice.  And it is the practice of planning and facilitating celebrations that is the focus of the third section of the thesis.  Some celebration practices are health enhancing while others are not.  Celebrations can be an opportunity to explore not just ourselves but our communities and how they oppress particular individuals and groups.  Many contemporary celebrations do not feel authentic or resonate with people.  They often remain at the surface and focus on passive forms of entertainment and the consumption of goods.  Deeper engagement can be facilitated through more participatory and creative activities such as dance, playing music, story -making and -telling and ritual; particularly when engaged in with conscious intention.  Celebrations at the individual level can be a positive, affirming experience that is personally meaningful and enables people to move towards their potential.  At a collective level they build relationships between the individual, groups and places.  They highlight the interconnectedness between all things.  And as such they are an integral part of community life.  I conclude by presenting an analytical framework to help understand the nature of celebration practice that is less or more likely to facilitate health and wellbeing.  I try to adopt the viewpoint of a practitioner interested in the health and wellbeing of individuals and communities.  I anticipate this knowledge will stimulate discussion particularly within the health and community sector about how celebration practice can be integrated into the work of health professionals and community workers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wellbeing</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">anniversaries</field><field name="subject">celebrations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New urban space in China: towns, rural labour and social inclusion.</field><field name="creator">Carrillo Garcia, Beatriz</field><field name="description">Since the late 1970s internal migration has become a fundamental feature of economic and social change in the People&#8217;s Republic of China. So has rapid urbanization as the rural population moves to the cities and towns in search for work. In the process, new urban spaces have been created that not only provide the springboard for economic development but also present challenges for social coherence and stability. Considerable attention has been focussed on the impact of this migration on the larger cities and on the migrants to those cities; processes that inevitably highlight the difficulties of China&#8217;s socio-economic transformation. Nonetheless, the experiences of those cities represent but one of the country&#8217;s urban realities. In fact, the majority of China&#8217;s urban population live in a highly dispersed system formed by thousands of small cities and towns.  Through the examination of a county in North China (Hongtong County, Shanxi Province) and its county town (Dahuishu Town) this study suggests that outside the larger cities there may be alternative accounts of urban social change and the integration of rural migrant workers. Empirical findings point to greater openness and flexibility in the incorporation of rural workers. Though shortcomings are still observed, there is also considerable governmental and social awareness of the problems brought by rural  -urban migration and urbanization processes; a willingness to act and a capacity to promote and deliver greater social inclusion. Dahuaishu Town&#8217;s distinct development experience has allowed for the construction of a more inclusive social environment, one which provides all inhabitants, including rural workers with a platform towards advancing their economic and social well-being. Impossible as it is to be representative of town development throughout China, this study provides an example of and a guide to alternative development processes to those documented in large urban centres. Small town urban development in Hongtong County is not a resolved issue, but it suggests that China&#8217;s transformation may not necessarily result in dysfunctional and socially polarized urban environments.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urbanization</field><field name="subject">labor</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">Hongtong County</field><field name="subject">Shanxi Province</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">It's like having to trade on the personal: changing work, changing identities of public health learning and development practitioners.</field><field name="creator">Wilkins, Rob</field><field name="description">As a practitioner involved in the planning and development of educational activities in the field of public health, I have worked within many pedagogical traditions and program parameters. Through this work, I have experienced both subtle and radical shifts in the range of skills, knowledge and relationships required to collaboratively plan and evaluate educational work. In this professional and community-based landscape, competing and often overlapping models of education and evaluation have led to much conceptual confusion and ambiguity around narrowly defined notions of best practice, evidence and knowledge legitimacy. Drawing from Dorothy Smith&#8217;s (1999) standpoint theory from which my inquiry was developed as a result of my participation with colleagues in the field, I explore how three professional practice networks of learning and development practitioners speak of the skills, knowledge, relationships and worker identities in a changing field. This research seeks to explicate the kinds of informal and largely unarticulated knowledge that is produced through the changing contexts of work. This research maps the changing conditions of educational work through my own case stories of educational practice and uses these as a springboard for discussion among three diverse professional practice networks. The Story/Dialogue Method (S/D-M) developed by Labonte and Feather (1996), is a constructivist methodological approach that, in this application, structures group dialogue into reflective insights and theories about how educational work occurs in varied settings among different professional and community-based groups. A strong reliance on interpersonal skills was articulated by all three networks to build trust, assess individual and organisational learning needs, to build partnerships and to motivate learners. Skills were often described vaguely and summarised as a series of situational specific attributes. A valuing of reflexive, working knowledge as opposed to professional or discipline-based expertise was raised as an important aspect of partnership building and in negotiating program parameters. The need to build individual and organisational relationships through formal and informal encounters was cited as a series of legitimate yet often &#8216;behind the scenes&#8217; professional practices. Aligning with the notion of worker identity described by Chappell, Rhodes, Solomon, Tennant and Yates (2003) as process, practitioners spoke of their identities as constructed and temporary, negotiated through newly emerging roles and changing relationships with peers and learners. This study suggests that evidence-based practice is a contested term drawing its meanings from multiple theoretical and pedagogical traditions including that of intuition. Perhaps unsurprisingly then, evidence guiding educational approaches is viewed as a pragmatic and eclectic mix of tools stored to be adapted for use in new ways. Additionally, this study concludes that all participants (including myself) regard educational practice as a collaborative and continually negotiated endeavour.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">health practitioners</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plagiarism or intertexuality? : a study of the politics of knowledge, identity and textual ownership in undergraduate student writing.</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Celia Helen</field><field name="description">Interest in plagiarism continues to generate debate both in the media and in the context of the academy. Opinions continue to differ not only about how plagiarism can be defined, but also about the nature of its causes and its possible solutions. Most universities have now developed websites to address the difficulties experienced by both students and staff in ascertaining exactly what kind of writing practices might constitute plagiarism. However more often than not, such websites tend to give undue emphasis to the mechanics of referencing and universal notions of &#8216;academic honesty&#8217; in order to make their point. Little or no attention is given to providing well-developed guidelines on what constitutes &#8216;common&#8217; knowledge, which is especially relevant currently given the growing cultural diversity of contemporary university classrooms. In addition, discussions about writer identity and authorship seem to be totally absent. This silence on such matters needs to be tackled as a matter of urgency.  I have adopted a &#8216;critical ethnographic&#8217; case study approach to this doctoral study in order to investigate how undergraduate university students from diverse language and disciplinary backgrounds have used the words and ideas of others in their written research-based assignments. The responses of academic staff to these students&#8217; writing practices have also been explored. Three different sources of data from ten students and ten academic staff have been collected in order to allow for data analysis from multiple perspectives through a process of triangulation. Bakhtin&#8217;s concept of dialogism (1981, 1984, 1986), Kristeva&#8217;s writings on intertextuality and the subject-in-process-and-on-trial (1986a, 1986b, 1986c, 1996) and Howard&#8217;s work on patchwriting, textual ownership and writer development (1992, 1995, 1999) have been central to the construction of the analytical framework used in this study. I argue that, the notion of &#8216;plagiarism&#8217; should be re-conceptualised in terms of transgressive and non-transgressive forms of intertextuality (see also Chandrasoma et al., 2004). My study also reveals how students react differently to the homogenising forces of the academy (Holton, 2000). Some feel alienated and have challenged or resisted these forces, while others have adopted an accommodationist position. Furthermore, this research shows that students are confused by unified and autonomous notions of textual ownership and originality that fail to conceptualise subjectivity and authorship as sociohistorically constructed and multi-voiced.  I conclude that educators need to recognise the political nature of the processes involved in the construction of text/knowledge and writer identity and recommend a dialogic approach to pedagogy, which allows for textual ownership and authority to be circulated and negotiated between students and their lecturers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plagiarism</field><field name="subject">intertextuality</field><field name="subject">undergraduate</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="subject">universities</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of plant communities in Ku-Ring-Gai Chase National Park, New South Wales: an examination of vegetation and environmental patterns.</field><field name="creator">Le Brocque, Andrew Francis</field><field name="description">Patterns in the floristic composition, stand structure, species richness and environmental characteristics of plant communities at a number of spatial scales were examined in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, New South Wales. Vegetation patterns in eastern Australia have often been related primarily to a single environmental variable, soil phosphorus concentration. This study examines the 'single nutrient' hypothesis regarding the distribution of plant species. If soil phosphorus concentration is the majot factor affecting the distribution of plant species, then this should be highly correlated with spatial patterns in the floristic composition of plant communities within the study area. Floristic composition was determined as the frequencies of all vascular species occuring within duplicate 500 m2 quadrants from fifty sites within the Park. Environmental data consisted of 21 variables, including soil physical and chemical characteristics, from each quadrant. The patterns in floristic composition and environmental factors are described and the relationships between composition and environment were examined. through indirect and direct gradient analyses. The measured environmental factors showed strong correlations with floristic patterns; however, two scales of species distributions were apparent: between and within soil type. Direct gradient analyses of composition and environmental data showed soil phosphorus concentration was inadequate in explaining the observed patterns in floristic composition of plant communities are a response to complex multivariable environmental gradients. The structural characteristics of vegetation stands were examined through the development of a multivariate approach to the classification of stand structure. This multivariate approach is essentially a modification of an existing scheme utilising foliage projective cover of various recognisable strata within the strands. Multivariate classification and ordinations of plant communities based on structural characteristics showed strong correspondence to that obtained by compositional analyses. The complex multivariable gradient hypothesis is supported from results examining stand structure-environment relationships. The relationship between species richness and richness of three growth-form types (tree, shrubs, and herbs) and environmental variables were examined through generalised linear models. The measured environmental variables showed strong relationships with species richness, consistent with the results found multivariately with floristic composition and stand structure. No single measured environmental variable adequately predicted the observed patterns in species richness, rather species richness showed strong relationships with complex multivariable environmental gradients. This study clearly demonstrates the the 'single-nutrient' or 'phosphorus' hypothesis is inadequate in explaining all the patterns in the various components of vegetation within Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. The complex multivariable environmental gradient hypothesis suggested by the relationships between floristic composition and environmental variables is supported by the relationships exhibited by two other attributes of vegetation communities: stand structure and species richness. Further studies testing the significance of the complex multivariable environmental gradient hypothesis are required.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plants</field><field name="subject">Ku-Ring-Gai Chase</field><field name="subject">national parks</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fighting falls with action research: a practice development project.</field><field name="creator">Dempsey, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Nurses espouse a caring ethic and demonstrate effectiveness in prevention of patient falls but are often observed taking risks with patients&#8217; safety. These actions reflect poor congruence between espoused values and behaviours. Attitudes, values and involvement in decision- making are factors that influence work behaviours. Nurses&#8217; attitudes are held to be a definitive factor in prevention work; however, few studies have focused on adherence with best practice principles of fall prevention. Yet nurses claim no authority to change their work. It was assumed that increased adherence would be achieved by improving nurses&#8217; attitudes through participation in decision- making surrounding fall prevention practice. This study aimed to tes t this assumption by empowering nurses working in two medical wards with high numbers of patient falls to improve their ownership of practice by utilising critical social theory and action research. Nurses&#8217; attitudes, including self-esteem, professional values and work satisfaction were established before and after a practice development project using action research. Mixed methods were employed by praxis groups meeting fortnightly for a year reflecting on, and re-engineering practice. Action research occurred in cycles focusing on assessment, communication, everyday work, and performance. Nurses&#8217; work was re-organised to gain time to spend in prevention work. Patients&#8217; environments were made safer and more patient-centred. New and effective ways of assessing risk to fall, communication of risk and monitoring nurses&#8217; performance of prevention work were created and evaluated. Analysis demonstrated that nurses had good self-esteem and professional values but were not satisfied with their work. Self-esteem and professional values were unaffected by participation in work-related decisions however, nurses expressed increased sense of ownership, more satisfaction and were observed to engage in more prevention work. In conclusion, manipulation of attitudes and values is not warranted if attitudes and values are good. However, participation in work-related decision- making engages practitioners and leads to greater congruence between values and behaviour. The &#8220;unspoken rules&#8221; constraining practice that were exposed in the action research oblige nurses to assume authority, confronting and dispelling these constraints to enable more therapeutic care to emerge. Recommendations include promoting practice development as the preferred means for cultural change and improving person-centred care whilst recognising its fragile nature and dependence on clinical leadership.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">accidents</field><field name="subject">falls</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Incorporating prior domain knowledge into inductive machine learning: its implementation in contemporary capital markets.</field><field name="creator">Yu, Ting</field><field name="description">An ideal inductive machine learning algorithm produces a model best approximating an underlying target function by using reasonable computational cost. This requires the resultant model to be consistent with the training data, and generalize well over the unseen data.

However certain environments contain rich domain knowledge prior to the learning task, but it is not easy for regular inductive learning algorithms to utilize prior domain knowledge. This thesis discusses and analyzes various methods of incorporating prior domain knowledge into inductive machine learning through three key issues: consistency, generalization and convergence. Additionally three new methods are proposed and tested over data sets collected from capital markets. These methods utilize financial knowledge collected from various sources, such as experts and research papers, to facilitate the learning process of kernel methods (emerging inductive learning algorithms). The test results are encouraging and demonstrate that prior domain knowledge is valuable to inductive learning machines.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">capital markets</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/385</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practising place: stories around inner city Sydney neighbourhood centres.</field><field name="creator">Rule, John</field><field name="description">The Neighbourhood Centres (NCs) in Sydney, Australia, were established to encourage forms of local control and resident participation and to provide a range of activities to build, strengthen and support local communities and marginalised groups. This thesis is concerned with exploring the personal conceptions, passions and frameworks, as well as the political and professional identities, of activists and community workers in these NCs. It also explores stories of practice and of how these subjective experiences have been shaped through the discourses around the NCs, some of which include feminism, environmentalism, multiculturalism and social justice. The following key research questions encouraged stories of community practice: What do the terms empowerment, participation, community service and citizenship mean for community organisation? What did community workers and organisers wish for when they became involved in these community organisations? What happened to the oppositional knowledges and dissent that are part of the organisational histories? Foucault&#8217;s concept of governmentality is used to explore the possibility that these NCs are also sites of &#8216;government through community&#8217;. This theoretical proposition questions taken-for-granted assumptions about community development and empowerment approaches. It draws on a willingness of the research participants to take up postmodern and poststructuralist theories. &#8216;Practising place&#8217; emerges in the research as a description of a particular form of activism and community work associated with these inner city Sydney NCs. The central dimensions of &#8216;practising place&#8217; include: a commitment to identity work; an openness to exploring diverse and fluid citizenship and identity formations; and the use of local knowledges to develop a critique of social processes. Another feature of &#8216;practising place&#8217; is that it involves an analysis of the operation of power that extends beyond structuralist explanations of how to bring about social change and transform social relations. The research has deconstructed assumptions about empowerment, community participation, community organisations and community development, consequently another way of talking about the work of small locally based community organisations emerges. This new way of talking builds upon research participants&#8217; understandings of power and demonstrates the utility of applying a poststructural analysis to activist and community work practices. Overall the research suggests that if activists and community workers are to work with new understandings of the operation of power, then the languages and social practices associated with activist and community work traditions need to be constantly and reflexively analysed and questioned.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">neighbourhood</field><field name="subject">inner city</field><field name="subject">centres</field><field name="subject">communities</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Birth dirt: relations of power in childbirth.</field><field name="creator">Callaghan, Helen M.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the findings of a doctoral study which analysed video tapes of labouring Australian women at the end of the 20th century, historical data from midwifery and medical textbooks, consumer material, and personal experience as a midwifery student in 1970- 1971. The data analysis was achieved using discourse analysis, but was influenced by Michel Foucault together with anthropological and sociological approaches, particularly as these can be applied to visual material. &#8216;Dirt&#8217; is a commonly accepted term, but it becomes difficult to define as it is so dependant on the context. Since the discovery of the germ theory in the 19th century, however, it is difficult for western health professionals to conceive of dirt as being anything but unaesthetic, unhygienic and pathogenic. When analysing the data from this study, it became evident that birth and dirt have a close association. The changes that have occurred in childbirth have revolved around who and what is perceived as clean, and who and what is perceived as dirty. This thesis argues that &#8216;birth dirt&#8217; exists, but, its form will vary depending on the time, the place, and the culture, although it is always centred around the physical reality of birth. Video tapes of the birthing process indicate that midwives, in their ritualised behaviours of containing, controlling and cleaning up the &#8216;dirt&#8217; associated with birth, create a barrier between themselves and the women. &#8216;Dirt&#8217; in this instance is the &#8216;contaminating&#8217; body fluids and substances derived from the woman and her baby. The dirt relationship is a power relationship and the midwife is an essential part of its structure. The midwife is the dirty worker who maintains the cleanliness of the environment and controls the &#8216;dirt&#8217; during birth. There is considerable rhetoric about midwives as being &#8216;with woman&#8217;, but the reality is that the midwives are more often &#8216;with dirt&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">childbirth</field><field name="subject">labouring</field><field name="subject">birthing</field><field name="subject">midwives</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blood ties: and 'Kings. what a good idea' : monarchy in epic fantasy fiction.</field><field name="creator">Freeman, Pamela</field><field name="description">The thesis Blood Ties is a novel in the epic fantasy tradition.

It considers evidence from folktale research, primate behavioural studies, literary traditions, both ancient and modern, and the effect of religious doctrine and history on the symbolic role of the monarch.  Folktales are found to have had very little effect on the role of kings in epic fantasy, which has been influenced by a combination of literary traditions, including the Arthurian saga and the historical romances of Sir Walter Scott.  More profoundly, the meaning of the king&#8217;s role has been influenced by the Christian mythos in two ways:  the king is a Christ surrogate who sacrifices his own safety for the good of the body politic and, in being successful against evil, restores a version of Paradise/Eden for his people.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fantasy</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="subject">monarchy</field><field name="subject">folktales</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the Scientology case: towards a better definition of what constitutes a religion for legal purposes in Australia having regard to salient judicial authorities from the United States of America as well as important non-judicial authorities.</field><field name="creator">Ellis-Jones, Ian</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to formulate a better definition of religion for legal purposes than the formulation arrived at by the High Court of Australia in the 1983 decision of Church of the New Faith v Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax (Vic). In that case, known in Australia as the Scientology (or Church of the New Faith) case, two of five justices of the High Court of Australia considered belief in a supernatural Being, Thing or Principle to be an essential prerequisite for a belief system being a religion. Two other justices stated that if such belief were absent it was unlikely that one had a religion. There are major problems with the High Court&#8217;s formulation in the Scientology case. First, it does not accommodate a number of important belief systems that are generally regarded as being religious belief systems, even though they do not involve any notion of the supernatural in the sense in which that word is ordinarily understood. Secondly, the Court provided little or no guidance as to how one determines whether a particular belief system involves a supernatural view of reality. The guidance that was given is ill-conceived in any event. Thirdly, it is philosophically impossible to postulate a meaningful distinction between the &#8220;natural&#8221; and the supposedly &#8220;supernatural&#8221; in a way that would enable the courts and other decision makers to meaningfully apply the &#8220;test&#8221; enunciated by the Court. The thesis combines a phenomenological approach and the philosophical realism of the late Professor John Anderson with a view to eliciting those things that permit appreciation or recognition of a thing being &#8220;religious&#8221;. Ultimately, religion is seen to comprise an amalgam of faith-based ideas, beliefs, practices and activities (which include doctrine, dogma, teachings or principles to be accepted on faith and on authority, a set of sanctioned ideals and values in terms of expected ethical standards and behavior and moral obligations, and various experientially based forms, ceremonies, usages and techniques perceived to be of spiritual or transformative power) based upon faith in a Power, Presence, Being or Principle and which are directed towards a celebration of that which is perceived to be not only ultimate but also divine, holy or sacred, manifest in and supported by a body of persons (consisting of one or more faithxvii based communities) established to give practical expression to those ideas, beliefs, practices and activities. The new definition is tested against 3 very different belief systems, Taoism (Daoism), Marxism and Freemasonry.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">religious</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">legal definition</field><field name="subject">faith</field><field name="subject">belief</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploration of critical thinking in environmental subjects.</field><field name="creator">Carmichael, Christine (Erst)</field><field name="description">This qualitative research study investigated the expression of critical thinking in environmental subjects at university level in Australia. It also explored the strategies used by lecturers to encourage student critical thinking. Initially an open-ended questionnaire was sent to lecturers and tutors in universities across Australia and the responses from thirty participants were analysed thematically. From these participants semi-structured interviews were arranged with six lecturers and eight students from three different universities. The third phase of the research process involved analysing subject outlines and student assignments. Findings were triangulated to create a picture of the teaching and learning practices of critical thinking in this field. The three cases of Environmental Science, Environmental Engineering and Environmental Law were identified as having some common yet distinctively different themes in relation to critical thinking. In each discipline area three broad approaches to the expression of critical thinking were identified: scientific/technical, paradigmatic and reflective. The scientific/technical approach in science was most concerned with critique of experiments and studies, in engineering with problem solving and in law with the technical aspects of language and application of the law. The paradigmatic approach included critical analysis of the different theories, frameworks and paradigms of each subject. The reflective approach to critical thinking included students&#8217; self evaluation of their learning within a specific subject. Notable differences between the three cases were the types of strategies used by lecturers to encourage student critical thinking. The Environmental Science lecturers were more inclined to use a wide variety of strategies, including provision of written material about critical thinking with critical thinking identified in marking criteria, discussion in class and guided exercises. The Environmental Engineering lecturers placed more emphasis on discussion in class than on providing written materials. The Environmental Law lecturers predominantly focused on the strategy of debating in class for the development of student critical thinking. The findings of this study are significant in providing support for the argument that development of critical thinking is subject specific rather than generic. This calls into question the use of generic skills testing for university graduates as a reliable measure of their ability to think critically in their field. The findings indicate that it is necessary for subject lecturers to be explicit with students about their expectations regarding critical thinking, particularly in relation to assessment. Findings suggest guidelines for lecturers including strategies and attitudes that encourage or hinder student critical thinking. Findings also suggest that the nature of the field of environmental and sustainability subjects lends itself to developing critical thinking, which is considered to be important.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Critical thinking.</field><field name="subject">Environmental science.</field><field name="subject">Environmental engineering.</field><field name="subject">Environmental law.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kolokol : spectres of the Russian bell.</field><field name="creator">Kaminski, Jason.</field><field name="description">Kolokol: Spectres of the Russian Bell, submitted by Jason Kaminski in fulfilment of the requirements of PhD (Humanities and Social Sciences) candidature at the University of Technology, Sydney, is an interpretative history of Russian bells (kolokola) and bell music (zvon). As a cultural object and sign, the Russian bell is associated with ideas of transcendence, and ideological and creative &#8216;vision.&#8217; This interpretation of the signification of the kolokol as a sign arises directly from the perception that the bell is essentially a physical (anthropomorphic) body that is capable of &#8216;projecting&#8217; or &#8216;transcending&#8217; itself in the form of a spectrum. This essential &#8216;spectrality&#8217; defines a history of the Russian bell as an instrument of magical, spiritual and religious ritual, as a cultural artefact associated with changing ideological movements (paganism, Christianity and communism) and as a sign represented synaesthetically in image, sound and text. Ethnographic and campanological studies observe that the kolokol &#8216;reflects Russian social history like a mirror&#8217;, representing the &#8216;voice of God&#8217; or Logos as an aural or &#8216;singing&#8217; icon, pointing to the primordial origins of language. This dissertation further investigates the idea that the kolokol acts as an &#8216;acoustical mirror&#8217; and &#8216;ideological apparatus&#8217;: a medium or spectre through which Russian history and culture is interpellated and reflected. The various logical streams (storytelling, legend, script, text, song, cultural theory, philosophy and ethnography) that contribute to this dissertation form a textual &#8216;polyphony&#8217; through which the essential meanings and &#8216;personae&#8217; of the kolokol as a cultural object are interpreted. The bell is regarded as presenting an enigma of signification that must be resolved through investigation and definition. The thesis concludes that the kolokol acts as an iconic sign of the creative &#8216;Word&#8217; (Logos) and as a symbolic sign that implies a &#8216;bridge&#8217;, copula or psychic &#8216;hook&#8217;, articulating the relationship between the cosmos and consciousness, the material and spiritual, the real and imaginary.

There has been considerable examination of cultural value in relation to museums. However, little is known about how value is created, captured and exchanged for stakeholders in new museums. It is posited that value creation, capture and exchange constitute a value cycle. Through this value cycle management in new museums detects and limits the liability of newness. The ability to detect and limit the liability of newness enables the continuation of the museum. If the liability of newness is not limited, it may mean that a new museum exits the sector or is transformed. The concept of a value cycle is derived from an examination of the nonprofit management literature, aspects of the for-profit management literature and the arts and museum management literature. Value creation is a key concept in the three literature areas. Value creation in this context, is specifically defined as the worth of the physical manifestation of the museum. It resides in the building and the collection, services and programs within the building. It is suggested that this value needs to be transformed and consumed by a range of stakeholders. The transformation of value creation is denoted as value capture. Value capture is the appeal of programs, projects and activities. Value capture includes how well the products and services align with particular stakeholders, how accountable the managers are to stakeholders and how products and services are consumed by stakeholders. The measure of how managers have been able to capture value is in the realm of value exchange. Value exchange is the merit of programs, projects and activities. Value exchange is in the form of revenue raised through sponsorship; continuation of revenue investment by the principal stakeholder, the state; time and money transacted by visitors; and intangible exchange such as leadership and reputation enhancement through collaborations. A Value Cycle Framework of New Entrant Museums is then developed as a working analytical tool to assess how the value cycle operates and how the liability of newness is detected and limited by museum management. x The Value Cycle Framework is used to assess four cases. These case studies include the National Museum of Australia as a purpose built new entrant; the Australian National Maritime Museum as a purpose built new entrant; the Mint as a recycled new entrant; and the Earth Exchange as a refurbished new entrant. Each case is assessed discretely using secondary and primary source material and analysing qualitative data generated from interviews with key stakeholders. The cases are then compared in order to track similarities and differences in relation to value creation, capture and exchange. The research findings suggest that a value cycle is operating in relation to new entrant museums. This value cycle is dynamic and non-sequential. Until value creation is floated for a range of stakeholders it is difficult for managers to know the worth of their content, location or their building. Value creation is a nominal starting point, signifying the arrival of a new entrant in the museum marketplace. However, value capture is the zone that is the most vulnerable and volatile for managers of new museums. Typically in these case studies value capture includes a disruptive episode, such as a review process that indicates the liability of newness. Managers within the museum who can respond and resolve contradictions between museological beliefs and the demands of stakeholders (and in so doing limit the liability of newness) are likely to continue museum operations. Senior executives who find such reconciliation more difficult, jeopardize the future operations of the museum to such an extent that the museums close or are transformed within the museum sector. Through these four case studies a revised Value Cycle Framework is developed as an analytical device. This analytical framework can assist in understanding the processes involved in new entry for museums.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">museums</field><field name="subject">value capture</field><field name="subject">value exchange</field><field name="subject">value cycle</field><field name="subject">museum management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Support services for adolescents and young adults with cancer or a blood disorder : measurement properties and validation of quality of life instruments for adolescents and young adults with cancer or a blood disorder.</field><field name="creator">Ewing, Jane Elizabeth.</field><field name="description">Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) is an important outcomes measure in cancer and there are specific issues depending on the site, stage, treatment and patient age. Although numerous instruments are available for cancer HRQOL, most are designed for adults, some for children, but none for adolescents and young adults (AYA) who have special age-specific concerns and poor improvement in survival compared with other age groups. An existing HRQOL instrument was modified to ensure its suitability for AYA, its validity, reliability and sensitivity were tested in Australians aged 16 to 25 years old diagnosed with cancer or a blood disorder. Varni&#8217;s PedsQLTM Measurement Model (13-18 year olds) was selected, modified then administered to families recruited from haematology/oncology clinics and wards at three Sydney Metropolitan Hospitals in person or by telephone. The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale was used to categorise participants into groups reflecting sensitivity of symptom severity (slight, moderate and severe).  The instruments demonstrated excellent internal consistency reliability, making them suitable for both group and individual comparisons. Clinical validity, construct validity, and discriminant validity were demonstrated by &#8220;known-groups&#8221; analysis, exploratory factor analysis and correlations, respectively. These new versions of the PedsQL Generic Core and Cancer Module are reliable, valid and sensitive measures of HRQOL in patients aged 16-25 years diagnosed with cancer or a blood disorder. The measures will soon be available for use as outcome measures in clinical trials and clinical practice with this age cohort in Australasia and internationally.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">blood disorder</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">young adults</field><field name="subject">quality of life</field><field name="subject">clinical practice</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Queer cinema as a fifth cinema in South Africa and Australia.</field><field name="creator">Peach, Ricardo.</field><field name="description">Australia had the world&#8217;s first gay film festival at the Sydney Filmmakers Co-op in June 1976, part of a larger commemoration of the Stonewall Riots in New York City of 1969. In 1994, South Africa became the first country in the world to prohibit discrimination in its constitution on the basis of sexual orientation, whilst allowing for positive discrimination to benefit persons disadvantaged by unfair discrimination. South Africa and Australia, both ex-British colonies, are used in this analysis to explore the way local Queer Cinematic Cultures have negotiated and continue to negotiate dominant social forces in post-colonial settings. It is rare to have analyses of Queer Cinematic Cultures and even rarer to have texts dealing with cultures outside those of Euro-America. This study offers a unique window into the formations of Queer Cinematic Cultures of two nations of the &#8216;South&#8217;. It reveals important new information on how sexual minorities from nations outside the Euro-American sphere have dealt with and continue to deal with longstanding Queer cinematic oppressions. A pro-active relationship between Queer representation in film and social-political action is considered by academics such as Dennis Altman to be essential for significant social and judicial change. The existence of Queer and other independent films in Sydney from the 1960s onward, impacted directly on sexuality, race and gender activism. In South Africa, the first major Queer film festival, The Out In Africa Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in 1994, was instrumental in developing and maintaining a post-Apartheid Queer public sphere which fostered further legal change. Given the significant histories of activism through Queer Cinematic Cultures in both Australia and South Africa, I propose in this thesis the existence of a new genus of cinema, which I term Fifth Cinema. Fifth Cinema includes Feminist Cinema, Queer Cinema and Immigrant/Multicultural Cinema and deals with the oppressions which cultures engage with within their own cultural boundaries. It can be informed by First Cinema (classical, Hollywood), Second Cinema (Art House or dual national cinemas), Third and Fourth Cinema (cinemas dealing with the decolonisation of Third World and Fourth World people), but it develops its unique characteristics by countering internal cultural colonisation. Fifth Cinema functions as a heterognosis, where multi-dimensional representations around sexuality, race and gender are used to assist in broader cultural liberation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">homosexuality</field><field name="subject">gays</field><field name="subject">queer culture</field><field name="subject">sexuality</field><field name="subject">motion pictures</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contemporary tiger girls : women and enterprise in the People's Republic of China, 2003-2005.</field><field name="creator">Chen, Minglu.</field><field name="description">The existing scholarship on women in China suggests that gender inequality still exists against the background of the country&#8217;s reform and opening in recent years. However, the situation of women in enterprise ownership and leadership seems to indicate that under the surface of women being disadvantaged, some of them are playing a more active and significant role in China&#8217;s economic development. Based on a series of interviews with women enterprise owners, wives of enterprise owners and women managers conducted in three localities in three difference provinces of China, this research aims to discover the deeper socio-political realities of leading women in enterprises. By analyzing information on these women&#8217;s personal experiences, career and families, this thesis investigates their status at work and at home, as well as their connections with local politics. The research results suggest that although traces of gender inequality can still be found in these women&#8217;s lives, they appear to be actively engaged in the business establishment and operation and gradually casting off the leash of domestic responsibilities. At the same time, these women have developed strong connections with the Party-state, not necessarily in their own right, but largely through their family ties. The research has also highlighted that the varied socio-economic development of each locality has its effects on these women&#8217;s development.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">businesswomen</field><field name="subject">entrepreneurs</field><field name="subject">enterprise</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">inequality</field><field name="subject">interviews</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The information technology adoption process within Indonesian small and medium enterprises.</field><field name="creator">Sarosa, Samiaji.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the adoption process of Information Technology (IT)-based solutions within small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia, in the furniture and handicraft industries. As the Indonesian SMEs grew in size, they faced new problems in managing their businesses. They have tried to use IT to support their business and resolve some of these problems. Yet in their efforts to adopt IT, they often faced new problems by introducing new technology into the organisation. The thesis examines the experiences of 35 Indonesian SMEs when they adopted IT. We investigated what factors were influencing IT adoption; the process of IT adoption which covers decision making, implementation or deployment and evaluation; and how SMEs cope with and recover from failure. The participants&#8217; experiences were compared to what has been reported in the existing literature. Analysis of the relevant research literature revealed some unexplored issues concerning IT adoption within SMEs. Most of the published research has been conducted in developed countries, with little in developing or less developed countries. From those few, only one was conducted in Indonesia and it was about IT diffusion. The focus of previous studies was mainly to explore factors influencing IT adoption and they mostly utilised survey techniques to elicit the factors. The scant literature suggests that exploring IT adoption can be approached from three different perspectives: individualist, structuralist, and interactive process. This thesis uses the interactive process approach to explore how well those factors that have been well documented in the literature actually work in Indonesian SMEs&#8217; IT adoption. As a result of our exploration, we formulated a model of an interactive process view of IT adoption within Indonesian SMEs. A qualitative approach was used to answer research questions and explore the participants&#8217; experiences in depth. In this thesis, we used in-depth interviews to explore participants&#8217; experiences. These interviews enabled us to draw out not only IT adoption processes but also successes and failures in IT adoption. Semi-structured interviews were used as the data collection tool. They provided guidance so the interviews stayed well within the focus of the thesis, yet provided room to explore new and relevant issues that emerged during the interview process. Content analysis of the interview transcripts was used to extract answers given during the semi-structured interviews and to identify new themes that emerged from the data. The analysis resulted in important findings. First, it confirms some factors found in the literature as actually influencing IT adoption in Indonesian SMEs. Despite some similarities, we found some differences such as government role and competitors&#8217; influence on IT adoption. The other findings are concerned with the failures faced by some of the participants. We then explore the differences between failed and successful participants, and how Indonesian SMEs cope with and recover from failed IT deployment. Finally, we revised the initial model of the interactive process of IT adoption. The extended model captures new insights into success and failure of IT adoption, and could provide a better understanding of IT adoption within Indonesian SMEs. The interaction between different factors in the IT adoption shows how those factors influence each other and how different stakeholders could manage their own interests related to IT adoption. The improved model could be used to guide Indonesian SME managers to manage their adoption of IT more effectively.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">medium enterprises</field><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">IT adoption</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrical conductivity imaging of aquifers connected to watercourses : a thesis focused on the Murray Darling Basin, Australia.</field><field name="creator">Allen, David Andrew.</field><field name="description">Electrical imaging of groundwater that interacts with surface watercourses provides detail on the extent of intervention needed to accurately manage both resources. It is particularly important where one resource is saline or otherwise polluted, where spatial quantification of the interacting resources is critical to water use planning and where losses from surface waterways need to be minimized in order to transport water long distances. Geo-electric arrays or transient electromagnetic devices can be towed along watercourses to image electrical conductivity (EC) at multiple depths within and beneath those watercourses. It has been found that in such environments, EC is typically related primarily to groundwater salinity and secondarily to clay content. Submerged geo-electric arrays can detect detailed canal-bottom variations if correctly designed. Floating arrays pass obstacles easily and are good for surveying constricted rivers and canals. Transient electromagnetic devices detect saline features clearly but have inferior ability to detect fine changes just below beds of watercourses. All require that water depth be measured by sonar or pressure sensors for successful elimination of effects of the water layer on the data. The meandering paths of rivers and canals, combined with the sheer volume of data typically acquired in waterborne surveys, results in a geo-referencing dilemma that cannot be accommodated using either 2D imaging or 3D voxel imaging. Because of this, software was developed by the author which allows users to view vertical section images wrapped along meandering paths in 3D space so that they resemble ribbons. Geo-electric arrays suitable for simultaneous imaging of both shallow and deep strata need exponentially spread receiver electrodes and elongated transmitter electrodes. In order to design and facilitate such arrays, signed monopole notation for arrays with iv segmented elongated electrodes was developed. The new notation greatly simplified generalized geo-electric array equations and led to processing efficiency. It was used in the development of new array design software and automated inversion software including a new technique for stable inversion of datasets including data with values below noise level. The Allen Exponential Bipole (AXB) array configuration was defined as a collinear arrangement of 2 elongated transmitter electrodes followed by receiver electrodes spaced exponentially from the end of the second transmitter electrode. A method for constructing such geo-electric arrays for use in rivers and canals was developed and the resulting equipment was refined during the creation of an extensive set of EC imaging case studies distributed across canals and rivers of the Australian Murray- Darling Basin. Man made and natural variations in aquifers connected to those canals and rivers have been clearly and precisely identified in more than 1000 kilometres of EC imagery.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electric conductivity.</field><field name="subject">Electromagnetic.</field><field name="subject">Conductivity.</field><field name="subject">Aquifers.</field><field name="subject">Watercourses.</field><field name="subject">Murray Darling Basin.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">States of exclusion : narratives from Australia's immigration detention centres, 1999-2003.</field><field name="creator">Browning, Julie.</field><field name="description">This thesis interrogates immigration detention as a space of intricate ambivalence - one which seeks to exclude, but which is also entreated to protect. The focus is so-called &#8216;unauthorised&#8217; asylum seekers detained both within Australia and offshore on the Pacific island of Nauru between 1999 and 2003 - when the numbers of detained asylum seekers reached its maximum and the government introduced offshore processing centres.  Australia&#8217;s immigration detention regime sits awkwardly with the discourse of universal human rights and brings into sharp conflict two robust political values: the right of endangered people to seek refuge and the right of the nation to determine who will enter.  Focusing on the experiences of detainees reveals immigration detention as a complex regime through which the state&#8217;s dominating power targets the stateless, non-white, male body. This targeting is intentional, serving to secure sovereign borders and to rearticulate the naturalised ties between the national population and the modern state.  Immigration detention holds the seeker in a limbo that sets parameters for the seeker&#8217;s experience of ongoing and intensifying insecurity. It specifically and intentionally fractures the identity of detainees: masochistic actions and collective protests, from hunger strikes to breakouts, reflect the common currency of anxiety and violence.  The creation of offshore camps was, in part, a response to ongoing protests within onshore detention and the failure of onshore detention to stop boat arrivals. My chief focus here is the largest Pacific camp, &#8216;Topside&#8217;, on the island of Nauru. Unlike the onshore detention centres where publicised protests and breakouts screamed of continuing detention of asylum seekers, those on Nauru were effectively silenced. The thesis explores purpose as inscribed within the body of the exile. To give up hope for asylum is to face the possibility of endless wandering and death. Mechanisms of resistance, whether explicit protest or more passive waiting, are parts of the continuing struggle by the detained against mechanisms of exclusion and exception. The detained carve out small openings to contest their exclusion and to reassert an identity as survivors.  There is a complex and fluid interplay between such resistance and government policies aiming to silence protest and limit identity &#8211; and ultimately to deter all unauthorised boat arrivals.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">detention centres</field><field name="subject">asylum seekers</field><field name="subject">human rights</field><field name="subject">immigration</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arabic collocations : implications for translations</field><field name="creator">Brashi, Abbas S.</field><field name="description">The subject of collocability has been a common concern among linguists, lexicographers, and language pedagogues recently.

Chinese visitors spent a total of NZ $352 million to the year December 2006, an average of NZ $3,340 per person (Ministry of Tourism, 2006). The latest statistics released from New Zealand Tourism Research Council show that 122,045 Chinese visited New Zealand by the year ended January 2008. These crucial statistics &#8211; market size, length of stay and average spend &#8211; indicate the necessity for the New Zealand tourism industry to understand and provide for Chinese expectations and requirements. Auckland is New Zealand's key gateway, and it is vital that Auckland provides a first good impression for the rest of country. Chinese travellers visit New Zealand with great desire and expectations of experiencing an exotic land. They expect Auckland, as the biggest city in New Zealand, to provide them with a memorable city experience in a developed country. The purpose of this research is to study Chinese tourists' expectations and travel experiences, with a particular focus on investigating whether Auckland can provide suitable services and experiences which match their requirements and expectations. The research will build on the study by Bull (1991) and Ryan (1995), which looked at supply demand relationships and at the tourism industry attempts to balance the supply with the actual demands. It will also build on work by Zhao (2006) and Qu (2006) which explored the dimensions of Chinese demand and distribution channel factors at both origin and destination. The goal is to establish which factors are adequate or inadequate. A synthesis of the demand supply situation will enable the development of recommendations. It is envisage that these recommendations could be adopted by local government and the tourism industry, either as actions or as improvements to policy. With regards to the purpose of this research, a qualitative method was decided as the most relevant approach. Qualitative methods are useful for revealing and understanding what lies are behind any phenomenon about which little is known. Grounded theory is a qualitative research method that was developed for the purpose of studying a social phenomenon, and to generate a theory relating to a particular situation (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1994). The historical bases of the grounded theory approach matches the aim of this research, namely to reveal the relationships between tourists and the tourism industry and to gain a better understanding of Chinese tourists' expectation and satisfaction, and the level of the service which the Auckland tourism industry provides to Chinese travellers needs to match the Chinese market and requirements of travellers. The interviews were conducted with both Chinese travellers and the Auckland tourism industry, including hotel managers, restaurant managers, gift/souvenirs shop assistants, tour guides, and so on. The research shows Auckland is not ready for Chinese market yet. This result comes from three aspects: firstly, most Chinese tourists do not have clear requirements or expectations of Auckland before they come to New Zealand. This is mainly because of the limited promotional materials available in China about Auckland. Secondly, Chinese tourists do not have many opportunities to get to know Auckland's attractions and activities after they arrive in Auckland. Auckland city is New Zealand's most popular urban tourism destination in terms of population and gateway function provides tourism facilities and services to Chinese tourists. However, the findings highlighted most Chinese tourists found Auckland's tourism attractions to be unattractive to them due to the language barrier and itinerary issues. Thirdly, the research also found Chinese tourists have been driven away due to lack of hotel accommodations in Auckland, especially in the shoulder or high seasons. Auckland's accommodation facilities are facing a challenge. The increasing domestic and international visitors' numbers and insufficient hotel accommodations will be the major problem for Auckland for the next decade. Most of the Chinese tourists who were interviewed expressed their hope of knowing more about Auckland, however, these hopes will go unrealised until the city provides better attractions and more services for them.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="subject">Chinese tourists</field><field name="subject">Demand and supply</field><field name="subject">Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GateOS : a minimalist windowing environment and operating system for FPGAs : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Buhler, Andreas</field><field name="description">In order to debug and tune stand-alone FPGA image processing configurations, it is necessary for a developer to also create the required debug tools and to implement them on the FPGA.

The Gate Array Terminal Operating System (GateOS) is proposed to relieve the developer of the need to construct many of these debugging tools. In GateOS we separate the image processing algorithms from the rest of the operating system. GateOS is presented to the developer as a Handel-C library, which can be customised at compile-time, to facilitate the creation of windows and widgets. Several types of widgets are described that can manipulate the parameters of image processing algorithms and enable the end-user to dynamically rearrange the position of a window on the VDU.

In this thesis, an equilibrium distribution technique was used to determine the thermodynamic behaviour of selenium and tellurium in molten slags used in copper production. Calcium ferrite based slags and copper or silver alloy were equilibrated in magnesia crucibles at temperatures of 1200 to 1400 &#176;C and oxygen partial pressures of 10-11 to 10-0.68 atm. Under conditions typical of those employed during copper converting, the minor elements were found to enter the slag as negatively charged species. The partitioning of selenium and tellurium to the slag was greatest at high temperature, low oxygen partial pressure and at highest concentration of basic oxide (CaO or BaO). The experimentally derived data were combined with published information to calculate the selenide and telluride capacities of the slag, and also to generate fundamental thermodynamic activity data for selenium and tellurium in the slag phase. It was found that the activity coefficients of selenium and tellurium were independent of their concentration in the slag over the range studied, but were strongly dependent on the temperature, slag chemistry and oxidation state of the slag. Experiments were also designed and carried out to determine what effect the presence of iron oxide and its oxidation state has on the behaviour of selenium in the slag. A series of experiments involving iron oxide additions to a calcium aluminate slag was conducted under increasingly oxidising conditions to assess the effect of total iron on the selenide capacity as the dominant oxidation state of iron in the slag changed. It was shown that at a constant ratio of CaO:Al2O3, the selenide capacity increased with total iron in the slag. However, the effect on the selenide capacity did not appear any more significant as the Fe3+:Fe2+ ratio changed in a particular direction. 4 Another series of experiments was carried out with iron calcium silicate slags to determine the stability of phases within the slag, and how this affected the equilibrium distribution and activity coefficient of selenium in the slag. A number of solid phases were identified and their composition determined by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy and electron microprobe analysis. The composition and minor element content of the remaining liquid was calculated using a thermodynamic model. From this it was found that the capacity of the liquid slag has a region of independence against slag chemistry, before increasing strongly with increasing lime content to the calcium ferrite composition. Some of the implications of this work are discussed with reference to the practicality of adjusting the process variables in a large-scale industrial process for the purpose of managing minor element content of the molten phases. Considerations include the effect on copper recovery and rate of wear of furnace refractory materials.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thermodynamics</field><field name="subject">Slag</field><field name="subject">Tellurium -- Metallurgy</field><field name="subject">Selenium</field><field name="subject">Thermodynamics</field><field name="subject">Minor elements</field><field name="subject">Slags</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0064</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In Pursuit of a Good Death: Managing Changing Sensibilities Toward Death and Dying</field><field name="creator">Hiley, Victoria</field><field name="description">Doctor of Juridical Science</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Death</field><field name="subject">Dying</field><field name="subject">Law</field><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="subject">Sensibilities</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/2614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainability analysis of farming systems in tidal swamplands : a case study in South Kalimantan, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Yanti, Nuri Dewi</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The initial success of the Green Revolution notwithstanding, the ability of our planet to produce sufficient food to support its growing population is causing growing concern. Indonesia, like many other countries, cannot produce sufficient rice to feed its people. This creates an imperative to import rice that Indonesia wishes to overcome. In addition, agricultural intensification has created ecological contamination from overuse and the mismanagement of chemical inputs. These problems threaten the sustainability of agricultural lands and Indonesia's ability to support national food selfsufficiency. The extension of agricultural lands is one alternative that has been implemented by the Indonesian government for more than two decades. Families from the crowded islands of Java and Bali have been translocated to the outer islands of Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Papua. In South Kalimantan, the tidal swampland areas are one of the resettlement destinations; which are usually reclaimed for the purpose of increasing rice production. However, the difference between the natural characteristics, socialeconomics, language, and culture in South Kalimantan, compared with the homelands of the transmigrant farmers, has the potential to adversely affect the farming activities of both the transmigrant and the local indigenous farmers. This in turn might affect the sustainability of the tidal wetlands for agricultural production. It may also damage the ecological integrity of the coastal environment  ... The research findings indicate that farming practices by the groups differed significantly. Similarly, there was a significant difference between the cultivation of traditional rice varieties and the HYV. Farming practices performed by the indigenous local farmers, who have lived in the swamplands for centuries, were more ecologically sustainable than those of their transmigrant counterparts in both of the tidal swamplands being assessed. Likewise, traditional (indigenous) rice variety cultivation appears to be more sustainable than the HYVs. Among the socio-economic and agronomic influences of the farming practices selected for statistical analysis, only the non-formal education variable had a significant impact on the sustainability index. Tidal swampland Type B has lower yields than Type A, but in both swampland types, indigenous farmers produce higher yields than the transmigrant farmers, while the HYV has a higher yield over the traditional one. Indigenous farmers received higher financial returns per ha compared to the transmigrant returns in tidal swampland Type A and Type B. The higher yields produced by the HYVs are not accompanied by a higher financial return per ha compared to the traditional variety. The conclusions of this research are that not only are indigenous farming practices more sustainable but that indigenous farmers achieve a higher overall output and higher returns per ha from their farming activities. Future research should be formulated to further investigate the implications for both increasing rice production and sustainability by extending the use of indigenous farming systems. The sustainability index developed in this research should be investigated for adaptation in other areas of Indonesia and possibly by other farming areas internationally.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable agriculture</field><field name="subject">Agricultural systems -- Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Migration, Internal -- Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Swampland farming systems</field><field name="subject">South Kalimantan</field><field name="subject">Transmigration</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting the recovery of orchids in a post-mining landscape</field><field name="creator">Collins, Margaret Thora</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Currently, Alcoa World Alumina Australia (Alcoa) mines and undertakes procedures to rehabilitate approximately 550 ha of jarrah forest each year at two open-cut bauxite mines in South-West Western Australia. Alcoa aims to establish a self-sustaining jarrah forest ecosystem that maintains the functions of the landscape prior to mining, including biodiversity, on areas that have been mined for bauxite. Indigenous terrestrial orchids form a significant proportion of the indigenous geophytic plant species that either fail to colonise rehabilitated areas or do so very slowly. Terrestrial orchids are considered to be particularly sensitive to competition from weeds and disturbance, which combined with the obligate nature of the orchid-mycorrhizal fungus association suggests that orchids would colonise rehabilitation areas only when both microhabitat sites and soil microflora have established. Occurrence of certain orchids may therefore be expected to be useful as indicators of ecosystem health, the success of vegetation establishment and the recovery of edaphic conditions suitable for orchid mycorrhizal fungi. Vegetation surveys were undertaken to compare orchid species richness and population size of a chrono-sequence of rehabilitation areas with adjacent unmined forest. ... Orchid taxa present in each vegetation assemblage were generally not exclusive to these assemblages, with the following broad exclusions: D. bracteata was found only in species assemblages associated with rehabilitation areas; and Eriochilus sp. and T. crinita were found only in species assemblages associated with unmined forest. No single orchid species appears to be an indicator of ecosystem recovery. However, the presence of populations of C. flava, P. sp. crinkled leaf (G.J.Keighery 13426) or P. recurva in combination with the absence of the disturbance opportunist orchid taxa D. bracteata and M. media appears to be a measure of the maturity of the rehabilitation vegetation. Orchid species richness and clonal orchid population size were correlated with changes in vegetation structure, but apart from the absence of orchids in 1 year old rehabilitation areas, these orchid population characteristics did not show any direct relationship with rehabilitation age or vegetation maturity. Only two orchid taxa appeared to have potential as indicators of vegetation characteristics: T. crinita as an indicator of undisturbed jarrah forest; and D. bracteata as an indicator of disturbed ecosystems. The results of this study suggest that most jarrah forest orchid taxa will readily colonise the post bauxite mining landscape, but that the unassisted colonisation by recalcitrant orchid taxa may be a prolonged process. It is recommended that field-based transplantation and/or seeding trials be undertaken with these recalcitrant taxa to determine if these procedures will enhance recruitment. The results of this work have applications not only in the management of post-mining landscapes but also in vegetation monitoring and conservation work in Western Australia and elsewhere.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Orchids -- Propagation -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Mycorrhizal fungi -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Aluminum mines and mining -- Environmental aspects -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neither counterfeit heroes nor colour-blind visionaries : black conservative intellectuals in modern America</field><field name="creator">Ondaatje, Michael L.</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on the rise to prominence, during the 1980s and 1990s, of a coterie of African American intellectuals associated with the powerful networks and institutions of the New Right.

These strong gradients act as a barrier to the vertical transport of mass and scalars leading to bottom anoxia and subsequent nutrient release from the sediments. The stratification is intermittently overcome by turbulent mixing events that redistribute mass, heat, dissolved parameters and particulates in the vertical. The redistribution of ecological parameters then exerts some control over the ecological response of the lake. This dissertation is focused on the physics of deep vertical mixing that occurs beneath the well-mixed surface layer in stratified lakes and reservoirs. The overall aim is to improve the ability of numerical models to reproduce deep vertical mixing, thus providing better tools for water quality prediction and management. In the first part of this research the framework of a one-dimensional mixed-layer hydrodynamic model was used to construct a pseudo two-dimensional model that computes vertical fluxes generated by deep mixing processes. The parameterisations developed for the model were based on the relationship found between lake-wide vertical buoyancy flux and the first-order internal wave response of the lake to surface wind forcing. The ability of the model to reproduce the observed thermal structure in a range of lakes and reservoirs was greatly improved by incorporating an explicit turbulent benthic boundary layer routine. Although laterally-integrated models reproduce the net effect of turbulent mixing in a vertical sense, they fail to resolve the transient distribution of turbulent mixing events triggered by local flow properties defined at far smaller scales. Importantly, the distribution of events may promote tertiary motions and ecological niches. In the second part of the study a large body of microstructure data collected in Lake Kinneret, Israel, was used to show that the nature of turbulent mixing events varied considerably between the epilimnion, metalimnion, hypolimnion and benthic boundary layer, yet the turbulent scales of the events and the buoyancy flux they produced collapsed into functions of the local gradient Richardson number. It was found that the most intense events in the metalimnion were triggered by high-frequency waves generated near the surface that grew and imparted a strain on the metalimnion density field, which led to secondary instabilities with low gradient Richardson numbers. The microstructure observations suggest that the local gradient Richardson number could be used to parameterise vertical mixing in coarse-grid numerical models of lakes and reservoirs. However, any effort to incorporate such parameterisations becomes meaningless without measures to reduce numerical diffusion, which often dominates over parameterised physical mixing. As a third part of the research, an explicit filtering tool was developed to negate numerical diffusion in a threedimensional hydrodynamic model. The adaptive filter ensured that temperature gradients in the metalimnion remained within bounds of the measured values and so the computation preserved the spectrum of internal wave motions that trigger diapycnal mixing events in the deeper reaches of a lake. The results showed that the ratio of physical to numerical diffusion is dictated by the character of the dominant internal wave motions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mixing -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Stratified flow -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Lakes -- Circulation -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Reservoirs -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Mixing in lakes</field><field name="subject">Hydrodynamic modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of global shape processing using radial frequency contours</field><field name="creator">Bell, Jason</field><field name="description">Encoding the shape of objects within the visual environment is one of the important roles of the visual system. This thesis investigates the proposition that human sensitivity to a broad range of closed-contour shapes is underpinned by multiple shape channels (Loffler, Wilson, &amp; Wilkinson, 2003). Radial frequency (RF) contours are a novel type of stimulus that can be used to represent simple and complex shapes; they are created by sinusoidally modulating the radius of a circle, where the number of cycles of modulation defines the RF number (Wilkinson, Wilson, &amp; Habak, 1998). This thesis uses RF contours to enhance our understanding of the visual processes which support shape perception. The first part of the thesis combines low and high RF components, which Loffler et al. have suggested are detected by separate global and local processes respectively, onto a single contour and shows that, even when combined, the components are detected independently at threshold. The second part of the thesis combines low RF components from across the range where global processing has been demonstrated (up to approximately RF10) onto a single contour in order to test for interactions between them. The resulting data reveal that multiple narrow-band contour shape channels are required to account for performance, and also indicate that these shape channels have inhibitory connections between them. The third part of the thesis examines the local characteristics which are used to represent shape information within these channels. The results show that both the breadth (polar angle subtended) of individual curvature features, and their relative angular positions (in relation to object centre) are important for representing RF shapes; however, processing is IV not tuned for object size, or for modulation amplitude. In addition, we show that luminance and contrast cues are effectively combined at the level where these patterns are detected, indicating a single later processing stage is adequate to explain performance for these pattern characteristics. Overall the findings show that narrow-band shape channels are a useful way to explain sensitivity to a broad range of closed-contour shapes. Modifications to the current RF detection model (Poirier &amp; Wilson, 2006) are required to incorporate inhibitory connections between shape channels and also, to accommodate the effective integration of luminance and contrast cues.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visual perception</field><field name="subject">Form perception</field><field name="subject">Shapes</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="subject">Perception</field><field name="subject">Contour</field><field name="subject">Local</field><field name="subject">Shape</field><field name="subject">Global</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0051</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of lupin kernel flour on satiety and features of the metabolic syndrome</field><field name="creator">Lee, Ya Ping</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Obesity is now a major public health problem worldwide. More than half the Australian population is now overweight. This is an important public health concern primarily because of the impact of overweight and obesity on risk of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Many strategies have been proposed to fight the obesity epidemic. One possible strategy involves understanding of the role of dietary components in the control of food intake. In this regard, dietary protein and fibre appear to be the most satiating nutrients. Foods enriched in protein, replacing energy from carbohydrate, or dietary fibre can increase satiety and reduce energy intake in the short-term. Longer-term trials suggest benefits of increasing protein or fibre intake on weight loss and features of the metabolic syndrome. The effects of dietary approaches which increase both protein and fibre at the expense of refined carbohydrate are uncertain. A practical approach to increasing both protein and fibre content of processed foods is to incorporate high protein and fibre ingredients into high carbohydrate foods. Lupin kernel flour is a novel food ingredient derived from the endosperm of lupin. It contains 40 to 45% protein, 25 to 30% fibre, and negligible sugar and starch. Lupin kernel flour can be incorporated into refined carbohydrate rich foods such as bread to increase protein and fibre content at the expense of refined carbohydrate. ... Body weight was measured every 2 weeks throughout the 16 week intervention, and these data were analysed to determine whether there was any between group difference in the rate of change in weight over 16 weeks. Over 16 weeks, lupin bread compared to white bread resulted in a significant increase in protein (13.7 (2.3, 25.0) g/d) and fibre (12.5 (8.8, 16.2) g/d) intakes, and a decrease in carbohydrate intake (-19.9 (-45.2, 5.5) g/d). There was a significant difference between groups in the rate of weight change over the 16 weeks (P=0.05). However, at 16 weeks there was no significant effect on body weight (-0.4 (-1.3, 0.6) kg), fat mass (-0.5 (-1.2, 0.2) kg) or fat free mass (0.2 (-0.5, 0.8) kg). Plasma adiponectin and leptin were not altered. Mean 24 hour systolic blood pressure (-2.4 (-3.4, -1.3) mm Hg) and pulse pressure (-3.1 (-3.9, -2.3) mm Hg) were lower for lupin relative to white bread, but diastolic blood pressure was not significantly different between groups. Apart from a lower HDL cholesterol for lupin relative to white bread (-0.09 (-0.17, -0.01) mmol/L), there were no significant differences in other blood lipids and glucose and insulin concentrations. Interpretation of the results was not influenced after adjustment for potential confounding factors. These studies assessed effects of bread enriched in lupin kernel flour relative to white bread, resulting in a higher protein and fibre intake and lower refined carbohydrate intake. This increased satiety and reduced energy intake acutely, but did not significantly influence body weight over 16 weeks. Systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure were significantly reduced. There were no significant improvements in blood lipids or glucose and insulin concentrations. Therefore, increasing protein and fibre intake at the expense of refined carbohydrate using lupin kernel flour may benefit satiety and blood pressure. Longer-term trials incorporating weight loss may be needed to observe benefits on body weight.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lupinus Angustifolius -- Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Fiber in human nutrition</field><field name="subject">Proteins in human nutrition</field><field name="subject">Carbohydrates in human nutrition</field><field name="subject">Energy metabolism</field><field name="subject">Metabolic syndrome</field><field name="subject">Obesity -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Lupin kernel flour</field><field name="subject">Overweight</field><field name="subject">Satiety</field><field name="subject">Metabolic syndrome</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Authentication of the Panax genus plants used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) using Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis</field><field name="creator">Rinaldi, Catherine</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Traditional medicines are used by millions of people throughout the world as their primary source of medical care. A range of materials are in used traditional medicines including plant and animal parts. Even though the traditional medicine trade is estimated to be worth sixty billion dollars annually the trade remains largely unregulated. Unscrupulous practices by vendors to increase their profit margins such as substituting and adulterating expensive material with cheaper varieties go unchecked. This can be dangerous to consumers because some substitutions involve poisonous material. Also, animal parts from endangered species can find their way into traditional medicines, therefore there needs to be a way to identify them in traditional medicines to prosecute poachers. The traditional techniques used for the identification of material used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) include, morphological, histological, chemical and immunological analysis. However, these techniques have their limitations. This makes applying multiple techniques essential to provide thorough authentication of the material. DNA profiling provides a technique well suited to analysing material used in TCM. DNA profiling is advantageous over other techniques used to authenticate material used in TCM because it requires only a small sample amount, can determine the cultivator, be used on all forms of TCM and potentially distinguish the components of mixtures. ...  Therefore, profiles of different species/individual are different and species? can be distinguished. Commercially sold traditional medicines are processed which is likely to degrade the DNA of the sample making extraction and amplification difficult. Here an organic Phenol:Chloroform extraction technique extracted DNA from commercial dried root samples. The extracted DNA was amplifiable using RAPD primers. The RAPD primers used here produced enough polymorphic bands to distinguish different plant species. They were used to distinguish commercial samples that were sold as three different species within the Panax genus, Panax ginseng, Panax quinquefolium and Panax notoginseng and genetically unrelated plant material; Potato and Eleutherococcus senticosus. Liquid samples and mixtures were also profiled with the RAPD primers to determine whether the RAPD primers provide enough distinguishing ability to analyse these forms of TCM. DNA was extracted from the liquid samples, one a ginseng drink and the other an ginseng extractum. However, there was no reliability in the production of PCR products. The analysis of the mixture samples found that not enough polymorphic bands were produced by the RAPD primers used here to identify Panax species within mixtures of two Panax species. While when P. ginseng was mixed with a genetically unrelated sample there was enough polymorphism to differentiate the two samples in the mixture. The results of this research show that RAPD analysis provides a simple and inexpensive technique to begin analysis of materials used in TCM. Using RAPD analysis it is possible to distinguish Panax plant species from each other. However, the RAPD primers used here did not provide enough reproducibility or polymorphism to analyse liquid and mixtures of Panax species plants.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA fingerprinting of plants</field><field name="subject">Ginseng -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">American ginseng -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">Medicine, Chinese</field><field name="subject">Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0054</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular identification and characterization of novel osteoclast V-ATPase subunits</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Tak Sum</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Osteoclasts are multinucleated giant cells responsible for the resorption of the mineralized bone matrix during the process of bone remodelling. During activation towards bone resorption, polarization of the osteoclast results in the formation of a unique plasma membrane, the ruffled border, the actual resorptive organelle of the osteoclast. Through this domain protons are actively pumped into the resorption lacuna creating an acidic microenvironment that favours the dissolution of the mineralized bone matrix. The polarised secretion of protons is carried out by the action of the vacuolar-type (H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase), composed of functionally and structurally distinct subunits of the V1 and V0 domains. The general structure of the V-ATPase complex is highly conserved from yeast to mammals, however, multiple isoforms for specific V-ATPase subunits do exist exhibiting differential subcellular, cellular and tissue-specific localizations. This study focuses on the molecular identification and characterization of V-ATPase accessory subunit Ac45 and the d2 isoform of the V0 domain d subunit in osteoclasts.

Using web-based computational predictions, two possible transmembrane domains, an N-terminus 'signal anchor' sequence and a C-terminus dilysine- like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal were identified. By confocal microscopy, EYFP-tagged e was found to localize to the perinuclear region of transfected COS-7 cells in compartments representing the ER and Golgi apparatus with some localization in late endosomal/lysosomal-like vesicles. ER truncation of e did not alter its subcellular localization but exhibited significantly weaker association with Ac45 compared to the wild-type as depicted by BRET analyses. Association with the other V0 subunits remain unaffected. This may hint at a possibility that Ac45 may play a role in the masking of the ER signal of e following it's incorporation into the V0 domain. Although no solid evidence for a role in the assembly of the mammalian VATPase have been established, subunit e still represents a potential candidate whose role in the V-ATPase complex requires further investigation. Collectively, the data presented in this thesis has provided further insight into the composition of the osteoclast V-ATPase proton pump by: 1) identifying an accessory subunit, Ac45 which shows promise as a potential candidate for the regulation and/or targeting of the V-ATPase complex in osteoclasts and truncation of its targeting signal impairs osteoclastic bone resorption; 2) identification and preliminary characterization of the d2 isoform of the V0 domain d subunit whose exact role in the V-ATPase complex and in osteoclasts remains to be determined, although its has been implicated to be essential for osteoclastic function; and 3) Preliminary characterization of subunit-e, a potential assembly factor candidate for the mammalian V-ATPase V0 domain.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Osteoclasts</field><field name="subject">Bone resorption -- Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Bones -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">Bones -- Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Bone cells</field><field name="subject">Adenosine triphosphatase</field><field name="subject">V-ATPase</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality effect in the design of adaptive e-learning systems : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information System at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Al-Dujaily, Amal</field><field name="description">This PhD thesis is a theoretical and practical study concerning the user model for adaptive e-learning systems. The research activity is two-fold. It firstly explores the personality aspect in the user model which has been overlooked in the previous literature on the design of adaptive e-learning systems, in order to see whether learners with different types of personality would have different effects on their learning performance with adaptive e-learning systems. And secondly, it investigates how to embody the personality features in the current user model, proposing that the inclusion of the personality in the user model for adaptive e-learning systems would lead to better learning performance. The thesis has considered the personality aspect in four parts. PART I reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on adaptive e-learning systems from which the main research questions are constructed. It explains how this study derives an overarching model for the inclusion of personality type in effective e-learning systems. PART II consists of the experiments, which explore empirically the importance of identifying the personality in the user model for adaptive e-learning and its effect in individual learning. That is, the main theme of the thesis hypothesises that different personality type&#8217;s influence performance with e-learning systems. PART III shows the effects of personality type on groups of learners performing collaborative learning activities. It suggests practical implications of designing collaborative learning technologies in conjunction with the personality feature. Finally, PART IV includes personality in the proposed user model and tests the primary hypothesis that &#8220;the personality may influence the learning performance of students using adaptive e-learning systems&#8221;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">instructional systems</field><field name="subject">computer-assisted instruction</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280104 Computer-human interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/668</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding user's perceived playfulness toward mobile information and entertainment services in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chou, Jacky Po Ching</field><field name="description">The convergence of mobile commerce and internet technologies has promised users unprecedented convenience and greater enjoyment. Over the past few years, the development of mobile information and entertainment services (MIES) has been phenomenal. Recently, research has been conducted into ways toward better acceptance of these services by users. However, many of these studies are technical driven, without discussing important end user needs. To understand users' perception associated with mobile information and entertainment services the author extended and empirically tested a new antecedent model of Perceived Playfulness an intrinsic motivator toward technology acceptance by users, based on previous research. It has been shown that user's Perceived Playfulness toward information technologies has a direct impact on his/her subsequent use. Using the new antecedent model of Perceived Playfulness, the author argues users' Autotelic Personality, Perceived Service Quality, Perceived Technology Compatibility, their Motivation for Using and tolerance of Social Influence affect their Perceived Playfulness when interacting with MIES. A questionnaire was administered to students in business and computing schools at Auckland University of Technology. The closed-ended questions within the questionnaire were used to validate the proposed research model. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares. Most of the proposed hypotheses were supported, rendering several significant findings in this thesis. In this study, it has been found that individuals who are more innovative and confident about using MIES are more likely to develop a positive image toward these services. They also value services that are useful and easy to use and demonstrate high enthusiasm for more personalized mobile services. More importantly, their perceptions toward MIES can be further reinforced if their mobile phone functionalities are highly compatible with these services. Therefore, service providers should strive to create a seamless MIES experience for users. Furthermore, given that mobile phones have their own strengths and limitations, the motivation behind user's choices of various applications becomes an important issue for service providers to consider. It has been shown that the importance of service attributes vary with user's motivations of using MIES. This study therefore focuses on several important end user issues which are not well explored in the research of mobile internet services. Overall, this study contributed to existing research into user s perception toward MIES as an information technology based on his/her intrinsic motivator. Several important antecedents have been identified to influence user's Perceived Playfulness in this context. Limitations and suggestions for future studies are considered at the end of this thesis. Implications are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile services</field><field name="subject">Mobile commerce</field><field name="subject">MIES</field><field name="subject">Perceived Playfulness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/383</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of sodium/calcium exchanger 3 (NCX3) knockout on neuronal survival following global cerebral ischaemia in mice</field><field name="creator">Jeffs, Graham J.</field><field name="description">Cerebral ischaemia is a leading cause of disability and death world-wide. The only effective treatments are thrombolytic therapy (plasminogen activator; tPA) and hypothermia (33?C). However, tPA has limited clinical application due to its short therapeutic time window and its specific application in thrombo-embolic stroke. Moderate hypothermia (33?C) is only being used following cardiac arrest in comatose survivors. Hence more treatments are urgently required. The first step in developing new treatments is the identification and characterisation of a potential therapeutic target. Since brain damage following cerebral ischaemia is associated with disturbances in intracellular calcium homeostasis, the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) is a potential therapeutic target due to its ability to regulate intracellular calcium. Currently, however there is uncertainty as to whether the plasma membrane NCX has a neuroprotective or neurodamaging role following cerebral ischemia. To address this issue I compared hippocampal neuronal injury in NCX3 knockout mice (Ncx3-/-) and wild-type mice (Ncx3+/+) following global cerebral ischaemia. In order to perform this study I first established a bilateral common carotid occlusion (BCCAO) model of global ischaemia in wild-type C57/BlHsnD mice using controlled ventilation. After trials of several ischaemic time points, 17 minutes was established as the optimum duration of ischaemia to produce selective hippocampal CA1 neuronal loss in the wild-type mice. I then subjected NCX3 knockout and wild-type mice to 17 minutes of ischaemia. Following the 17 minute period of ischaemia, wild-type mice exhibited  80% CA1 neuronal loss and  40% CA2 neuronal loss. In contrast, NCX3 knockout mice displayed &gt; 95% CA1 neuronal loss and  95% CA2 neuronal loss. Following experiments using a 17 minute duration of global ischaemia, a 15 minute duration of ischaemia was also evaluated. Wild-type mice exposed to a 15 minute period of ischaemia, did not exhibit any significant hippocampal neuronal loss. In contrast, NCX3 knockout mice displayed  45% CA1 neuronal loss and  25% CA2 neuronal loss. The results clearly demonstrate that mice deficient for the NCX3 protein are more susceptible to global cerebral ischaemia than wild-type mice. My findings showing a neuroprotective role for NCX3 following ischaemia, suggest that the exchanger has a positive role in maintaining neuronal intracellular calcium homeostasis. When this function is disrupted, neurons are more susceptible to calcium deregulation, with resultant cell death via calcium mediated pathways. Therefore, improving NCX activity following cerebral ischaemia may provide a therapeutic strategy to reduce neuronal death.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cell death</field><field name="subject">Neurons</field><field name="subject">Cerebral ischemia -- Animal models</field><field name="subject">Sodium channels -- Animal models</field><field name="subject">Calcium channels -- Animal models</field><field name="subject">Stroke/cerebral ischaemia</field><field name="subject">Sodium/calcium exchanger (NCX)</field><field name="subject">NCX3</field><field name="subject">NCX3 knockout mouse</field><field name="subject">Global cerebral ischaemia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0063</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Origins and use of the stochastic and sound-evoked extracellular activity of the auditory nerve</field><field name="creator">Brown, Daniel</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The present study investigated whether any of the characteristics of the compound action potential (CAP) waveform or the spectrum of the neural noise (SNN) recorded from the cochlea, could be used to examine abnormal spike generation in the type I primary afferent neurones, possibly due to pathologies leading to abnormal hearing such as tinnitus or tone decay. It was initially hypothesised that the CAP waveform and SNN contained components produced by the local action currents generated at the peripheral ends of the type I primary afferent neurones, and that changes in these local action currents occurred due to changes in the membrane potential of these neurones. It was further hypothesised that the lateral olivo-cochlear system (LOCS) efferent neurones regulate the membrane potential of the primary afferent dendrites to maintain normal action potential generation, where instability in the membrane potential might lead to abnormal primary afferent firing, and possibly one form of tinnitus. We had hoped that the activity of the LOCS efferent neurones could be observed through secondary changes in the CAP waveform and SNN, resulting from changes in the membrane potential of the primary afferent neurones. The origins of the neural activity generating the CAP waveform and SNN peaks, and the effects of the LOCS on the CAP and SNN were experimentally investigated in guinea pigs using lesions in the auditory system, transient ischemia and asphyxia, focal and systemic temperature changes, and pharmacological manipulations of different regions along the auditory pathway. ... Therefore, the CAP and SNN are altered by changes in the propagation of the action potential along the primary afferent neurones, by changes in the morphology of the tissues surrounding the cochlear nerve, and by changes in the time course of the action currents. If the CAP waveform is not altered, the amplitude of the 1kHz speak in the spontaneous SNN can be used as an objective measure of the spontaneous firing rate of the cochlear neurones. However, because the SNN contains a complex mixture of neural activity from all cochlear neurones, and the amplitude of the spontaneous SNN is variable, it would be difficult to use the spontaneous SNN alone as a differential diagnostic test of cochlear nerve pathologies. To record extratympanic electrocochleography (ET ECochG) from humans, a custom-designed, inexpensive, low-noise, optically isolated biological amplifier was built. Furthermore, a custom-designed extratympanic active electrode and ear canal indifferent electrode were designed, which increased the signal-to-noise ratio of the ECochG recording by a factor of 2, decreasing the overall recording time by 75%. The human and guinea pig CAP waveforms recorded in the present study appeared similar, suggesting that the origins of the human and guinea pig CAP waveforms were the same, and that experimental manipulations of the guinea pig CAP waveform can be used to diagnose the cause of abnormal human ECochG waveforms in cases of cochlear nerve pathologies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cochlea -- Innervation</field><field name="subject">Electrocochleography</field><field name="subject">Hearing disorders -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Ensemble neural noise</field><field name="subject">Compound action potential</field><field name="subject">Cochlear nerve pathologies</field><field name="subject">Objective diagnosis of hearing disorders</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0082</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflections on Lal Batti</field><field name="creator">Kumar, Chander</field><field name="description">This project draws on aspects of research into the plight of women prostitutes working in Lal Batti areas of India.

The ethnic comparison of body composition may help to explain and understand the difference of health outcomes and health status in different ethnic groups. NZ Chinese is the largest Asian group in New Zealand, however, knowledge about health risks and body composition for NZ Chinese is very limited. Therefore, the aims of this thesis were: 1) To compare the relationships between body mass index (BMI) and percentage body fat (%BF) of European (M29, F37), Maori (M23, F23), Pacific people (M15, F23), and Asian Indian (M29, F25) (existing data) with NZ Chinese aged 30-39 years; 2) To compare fat distribution, appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ApSM), bone mineral density (BMD) and limb bone lengths across these five ethnic groups.  A convenience sample of healthy NZ Chinese (M20, F23) was selected by BMI to cover a wide range of body fatness. Total and regional body fat, fat free mass (FFM) and bone mineral content were measured by whole-body Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The main study findings were: &#8226;	For a fixed BMI, NZ Chinese had a higher %BF than European and less %BF than Asian Indian. At a %BF equivalent to a BMI of 30 kg.m-2 in Europeans (WHO threshold for obesity), BMI values for Asian Indian and NZ Chinese women were 5.8 and 2.2 BMI units lower than European, respectively, and for Asian Indian and NZ Chinese men, 8.2 and 3.0 BMI units lower. &#8226;	Abdominal-to-thigh fat ratio of NZ Chinese was significantly higher than that of European (P&lt;0.001) and similar to that of Asian Indian. NZ Chinese had a significantly higher central-to-appendicular fat ratio than both Asian Indian and European (P&lt;0.001). NZ Chinese was centrally fatter than European and Asian Indian. &#8226;	For the same height and weight, NZ Chinese had significantly less FFM (-2.1 kg, P=0.039) and ApSM (-1.4kg, P=0.007) than European. NZ Chinese had significantly more FFM (+3.2 kg, P=0.001) than Asian Indian and similar ApSM to Asian Indian. &#8226;	For the same weight, NZ Chinese had a similar BMD as European for female and male. NZ Chinese male had a higher BMD (+0.07 g.cm-2, P= 0.001) than Asian Indian male. &#8226;	Among the five ethnic groups, NZ Chinese had the shortest leg (-1.5cm, P=0.016) and arm bone lengths (-2.3cm, P=0.001) (measured by DEXA) for the same DEXA height.  Therefore, the relationship between percent body fat and BMI for Asian Indian and NZ Chinese differs from Europeans and from each other, which indicates that different BMI thresholds for obesity may be required for these Asian ethnic groups. Given the relatively high percentage body fat, low appendicular skeletal muscle mass and high central fat to appendicular fat ratio of NZ Chinese aged 30-39 years demonstrated in this study, promotion of healthy eating and physical activity is needed to be tailored for NZ Chinese. The NZ Chinese community should be advised to keep fit, prevent limited movements in older age, and to prevent obesity and obesity-related diseases.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">Body composition</field><field name="subject">DEXA</field><field name="subject">BMI</field><field name="subject">Body fat</field><field name="subject">Ethnic comparison</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/385</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Not what we are : the (co)re-creation of self : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design in Fashion at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Deonarain, Jennifer Irene</field><field name="description">Researching through design, this thesis explores the implementation of an online kit as a means through which the postmodern individual can participate in the creative processes of home sewing.

Three groups representing different socio-economic and geographical areas were selected to explore the relationships between psycho-social factors and the development of swimming ability among year seven students. Two groups from lower socio-economic areas were chosen. The first group was directly on the coast with easy access to the beach, while the second group was inland in the foothills of Perth. As higher socio-economic areas in Perth are generally not far from the coast only one group from a higher socio-economic coastal area was chosen. The participants were 540 year seven students, 282 of whom were males and 258 of whom were females. The primary variable of interest was the current swimming stage of year seven participants, and the differences between genders and/or locality groups. The primary research questions investigated differences between locality groups and/or genders for; a) perceived athletic competence and global self-worth, b) perceived swimming competency, confidence in deep water and importance placed on learning to swim well. c) perceived social support for sport and swimming activities and d) attendance at Interm, Vacswim and other swimming programs and aquatic venue experience. Relationships between swimming stage and the above variables were analysed. The secondary research questions investigated the most frequent reasons given by the students for not attending or discontinuing participation inVacswim, and whether there were differences between locality groups or genders. Findings indicated that the lower socio-economic groups had a significantly lower swimming stage and lower perceived self-worth than the higher socioeconomic group. Students from the lower socio-economic inland area had the lowest mean swimming stage as well as lower perceived social support for sport and swimming than either of the other two groups in the study. The two lower socioeconomic groups also attended less swimming instruction and placed less emphasis on the importance of learning to swim well than the higher socio-economic group. Despite these findings, the lower socio-economic groups did not view themselves as any less able in terms of athletic and swimming competence. However, as the two lower socio-economic groups have not progressed along the Swimming and Water Safety Continuum to the 'desirable standards' of the RLSSA (1999), these groups could be viewed as at-risk in an aquatic environment. At the same time, there was evidence that attendance at Interm along with attendance at another swimming program enabled participants to reach the 'desirable standards' of the RLSSA (1999). Girls generally had a higher swimming stage than boys in the lower socio-economic areas, attended year seven Interm and Vacswim more than boys, reported more social support for sport and swimming, and placed more emphasis on the importance of learning to swim well than boys. While many of these relationships between swimming stage and psycho-social factors have been intuitively accepted within the swimming teaching industry, we now have a better understanding of the strength and direction of these relationships.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Swimming for children -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Swimming for children -- Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Swimming for children -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Swimmimg competency</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Caesarean section in the absence of clinical indications : discourses constituting choice in childbirth : thesis submitted to Massey University of Palmerston North in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Midwifery, Massey University, Palmerston North</field><field name="creator">Douche, Jeanie Raeburn</field><field name="description">This poststructuralist qualitative study explored the discourses constructing women&#8217;s choice for a caesarean section in the absence of clinical indications, in the talk and texts of women, midwives, an obstetrician, professional journals and the media publications. The study affirms inscriptions surrounding choice in childbirth are shaped discursively through a multiplicity of discourses underpinned by social and institutional practices. With advances in technology, childbearing women have a greater variety of options from which to choose. Controversial, is the option of a caesarean section, regardless of clinical need. The issue is depicted in both professional and popular discourse as contentious, complex and contradictory. Its momentum into the 21st century, as a new object of obstetric discourse, has been played out on a number of platforms. In this thesis I draw from the theoretical ideas of French philosopher Michel Foucault, to examine this complex debate. I argue there is a volatile moment in the history of childbirth in which an explosion of discourses have sculptured choice for a caesarean, in the absence of clinical indications, out of a repartee of autonomy, convenience, desire, fear and risk. In this precarious moment, new meanings joust with the old on a shifting terrain awash with rhetoric that co-opts, competes, and contradicts to bring about a cach&#233; of mutable &#8216;truths&#8217;. Whether caesarean, as an optional extra, can be explained in terms of a libertarian imperative, an embodiment of lifestyle, the satiation of desire, the attenuation of fear or the avoidance of risk, the democratisation of this choice has exposed a pathologising paradox, whereupon the normal emerges as the abnormal, and the abnormal emerges as the normal. The deconstruction of choice through a poststructuralist lens has enabled insight into how contradiction and contest befall the &#8216;order of things &#8217; and in so doing, provides new openings for contemplating the discursive positioning of women through the competing discourses of childbirth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">caesarean section</field><field name="subject">childbirth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321014 Obstetrics and gynaecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pioneers of Japanese Bible translation : the application of the dynamic equivalent method in Japan : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Japanese at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Doi, Akira</field><field name="description">The objective of this study is to investigate the appropriateness of the term kami (&#31070;) as the translation of the term &#8216;God&#8217; from the point-of-view of Dynamic Equivalent (DE) translation in Japan. The study argues that the translated term kami (&#31070;) in the Japanese Bible was adopted at first without sufficient investigation of its appropriateness but because of its penetrating character, it became the exclusive term to represent the monotheistic God. Discussion of the effect of the philosophy of Dynamic Equivalent translation in the history of Bible translation in Japan and the history of the changes of the Japanese notion of God is used to justify the validity of the above argument. As a procedure, two translation methods (DE and FE) seen in conventional Bible translations have been compared, supported by case studies where these methods are used. Next, to understand the mind of the Japanese who were the recipients of the new concept of God, the history of Japanese Shinto is discussed. Finally, the lives of two Japanese assistants of Japanese Bible translation, Anjir&#333; and Otokichi, are studied. The study concludes that the adoption of kami (&#31070;) was appropriate from the point-of-view of DE translation, and the Japanese assistants also applied the DE translation method unconsciously. A reassessment of their selection of the terms for God is possible if they are seen as examples of the DE translation method.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">translation</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">Bible</field><field name="subject">dynamic equivalent method</field><field name="subject">God</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420115 Japanese</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/671</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Anything but conventional' : faith and folk idioms in Dvo&#345;&#225;k's Biblical songs : a thesis submitted to the New Zealand School of Music in fulfilmentof the requirements for the degree of Master of Music in Musicology, New Zealand School of Music</field><field name="creator">King, Erin Lee</field><field name="description">In the nineteenth century considerable ambiguities arose regarding sacred and secular categories in music. Although such ambiguities have often been discussed in relation to the mass, this study uses the genre of the lied - in particular, Dvo&#345;&#225;k's Biblical Songs - as a means of examining the interaction between these categories. The problems inherent in the idea of 'sacred lieder' are discussed, including case studies of Schubert's 'Die Allmacht' and Wolf's 'Nun wandre, Maria' from the Spanisches Liederbuch. The Biblical Songs are located within Dvo&#345;&#225;k's biography, to show the great extent to which they were a reflection of his personal situation. In-depth analysis of the music and texts of the songs, both individually and as a cycle, reveals that they are representative of a point of interaction between secular lieder for concert performance, and devotional lieder for a domestic context. A comparison with Brahms and his Four Serious Songs reveals two very different responses to biblical texts: whereas Brahm's solution places emphasis on secular love, Dvo&#345;&#225;k's songs show a progression from doubt and confusion about God through to faith and rejoicing. Furthermore, whereas the Four Serious Songs demonstrate a highly individualistic solution to the pessimism expressed earlier in the cycle, Dvo&#345;&#225;k's use of folk idioms at key locations in the Biblical Songs places emphasis on communality and tradition. However, the cycle also reveals a more complex expression of faith than is often assumed of Dvo&#345;&#225;k.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dvo&#345;&#225;k</field><field name="subject">leider</field><field name="subject">sacred songs</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/672</field></doc><doc><field name="title">We made this song : the group song writing processes of three adolescent rock bands : a thesis submitted to the New Zealand School of Music in the fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Music in History and Literature of Music, New Zealand School of Music</field><field name="creator">Thorpe, Vicki</field><field name="description">In garages, practice rooms and classrooms, young people are composing music in rock and pop bands; engaged in working together in the shared enterprise of group music making. This study aims to contribute to scholarly knowledge through describing, analysing and interpreting the collaborative compositional processes (song writing) of three teenage rock bands. A theoretical model was developed and is applied to an analysis of the compositional processes of each group. Communication within each of the bands is analysed in terms of musical, nonverbal and verbal communication. The teaching and cooperative learning that occurred within each of the bands is presented, and each band is described in terms of a community of practice. An analysis of the compositional processes reveals that the three bands employed similar methods to generate ideas and construct their songs. However, when the data are viewed from a number of other theoretical perspectives, it is clear that two of the bands composed collaboratively, working together within mutually supportive, highly focussed and respectful communities; and that the third band&#8217;s songs were the work of a single composer, achieved through the cooperation and participation of the other band members. The young people in all three bands were highly engaged in selfdirected music learning, finding meaning and identity in the process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">song writing</field><field name="subject">collaboration</field><field name="subject">music composition</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/673</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of computerisation on the quality of care in Australian general practice</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Joan Veronica</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">General practice</field><field name="subject">family practice</field><field name="subject">quality indicators</field><field name="subject">quality of health care</field><field name="subject">computer systems in health care</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/2649</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching Is My Art Now</field><field name="creator">Stanley, Denise Y</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Denise Stanley, arts-informed inquiry, constructivism, collage, narrative, self-narrative, Visual Arts education, early career teachers, first year teaching, transitions, teaching as an art form, artists</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/2653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a Language of Interruption</field><field name="creator">Sturgess, Helen Mary</field><field name="description">Master of Visual Arts</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mother</field><field name="subject">artist</field><field name="subject">mothering</field><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">motherhood</field><field name="subject">intersubjectivity</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/2665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natural eating behaviour and its effect in labour outcomes</field><field name="creator">Parsons, Myra</field><field name="description">The appropriate oral intake for labouring women has long been a controversial issue among midwives and anaesthetists. Anaesthetists argue that any type of food and, to some extent, fluid consumption during labour, will increase a woman&#8217;s risk of gastric content aspiration if general anaesthesia is required. Many midwives believe that aspiration, being such a rare event with contemporary medical practice, is unlikely in the hands of a skilled obstetric anaesthetist. These midwives believe that labouring without any form of sustenance other than water or clear fluids may be detrimental for the woman, her baby and the progress of labour. To date, research has been unable to provide reliable information to support either side of this debate. This thesis presents a series of studies (three surveys and a comparative trial) designed to enhance the body of knowledge available for decisions about labouring women&#8217;s oral requirements. The surveys were conducted to describe the policies of hospitals in New South Wales, Australia, and the views and practices of anaesthetists and midwives regarding the oral intake of labouring women. The main findings of this thesis come from a comparative study conducted to explore the effect of eating or not eating food on labour and birth outcomes of 217 nulliparous women with low risk pregnancies, (Eating group = 123; Non-eating group = 94). The study employed a naturalistic approach to its design in order to capture the actual eating behaviour of labouring women rather than the manipulated approach used in a randomised control trial. The findings from this series of studies suggest women should be informed of the lack of evidence to support any dietary regime for labour, along with the possible risks and benefits, and allowed to make their own decisions about their oral intake needs for labour. Although this thesis has augmented knowledge, it has been unable to demonstrate that eating food during labour improves labour and birth outcomes. However, it did not find this practice to be harmful for mothers or babies. The lack of reliable research evidence on which to base practice decreases the ability of midwives to be assured of the &#8216;best practice&#8217; for labouring women&#8217;s oral intake. Further research is essential to ascertain &#8216;best practice&#8217; for this aspect of care.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">childbirth</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">labor (obstetrics)</field><field name="subject">complications</field><field name="subject">maternal health services</field><field name="subject">standards</field><field name="subject">natural childbirth</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/20637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carving a niche for Australian practice nurses in chronic heart failure management</field><field name="creator">Halcomb, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Chronic and complex conditions are a significant concern within contemporary health care systems. The ageing population and improvements in survival from acute cardiac illness have seen an increasing incidence of heart failure (HF). Heart failure represents a significant burden on both the individual and the wider community. Despite effective pharmacotherapy and established evidence-based management guidelines, the overall prognosis from HR is poor. The complexity of the disease process and the highly developed evidence-base makes HR an excellent exemplar for the management of a range of chronic conditions. Studies undertaken as part of the &#8216;Carving a niche for Australian practice nurses&#8217; project have led to the development of a model of care that integrates the role of the practice nurse with those of other health care providers to improve outcomes for people with chronic and complex conditions. Whilst the model of care developed from these studies requires empirical testing to validate its utility, it is currently being incorporated in clinical planning and ongoing pragmatic research. The systematic, sequential derivation of data from this &#8216;Carving a niche for Australian practice nurses&#8217; project will inform the development of primary care and provide a conceptual framework for future intervention studies in Australian general practice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nurse practitioners</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">primary care (medicine)</field><field name="subject">heart failure</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">nursing specialities</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/20689</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the information content of idiosyncratic equity return variation</field><field name="creator">Rahman, Md. Arifur</field><field name="description">Research in this thesis deals with some unexplored, or only partially explored, issues relating to the information content of volatility of the idiosyncratic component of asset returns at the firm and industry-level, both in the context of developed and emerging stock markets. Specific issues we have investigated include potential role of idiosyncratic volatility of equity returns for the explanation of future stock market volatility, aggregate economic activity, cross-border information transmission, and fundamental efficiency of stock prices. Chapter 2 of the thesis presents research into the information content of firm and industry-level idiosyncratic volatility, estimated as cross-sectional volatility (CSV), for future market-level volatility in Australia. We find that CSV does contain information beyond what is already contained in the lagged market-level return shocks and has a significant positive relationship with conditional market volatility. Our analysis gives new empirical evidence that the effect of CSV is stronger in relatively stable market conditions than in more volatile market conditions. We also examine how the information content of stock turnover and aggregate company announcements compares with that of CSV, and take a novel data-driven approach to verify whether CSV captures any information about multiple common factor shocks in asset returns. The explanatory power of CSV for future market volatility remains robust even after controlling for the effects of stock turnover, company announcements and omitted factor shocks in returns. These results are in line with the theoretical models relating volatility to the flow of information to the market, and suggest that the amount of information as captured by the firm and industry-level CSV shares a common co-movement with the market-wide information flow. In Chapter 3, unlike most other studies investigating the role of macroeconomic aggregates in explaining the fluctuations in stock market returns, we consider the possibility of reverse causality, and that using idiosyncratic volatility of industry-level stock returns in the context of Australia. Both the theories of investment and consumption under uncertainty and the models of sectoral reallocation provide rationale for the analysis. By explicitly modeling the cyclical patterns of industry-level volatility and relating it to corresponding cyclical behaviour of macroeconomic variables, we show that industry-level volatility is a leading indicator of the cyclical movements in output growth and inflation in Australia. We find complementary evidence from the multi-step Granger causality test and the impulse response analysis based on a vector autoregression of industry-level volatility, GDP growth, inflation and changes in unemployment rate. However, the forecast error variance decompositions suggest that although the industry-level volatility accounts for a significant fraction of the forecast error of inflation, this explains only a small fraction of output and unemployment uncertainties. Further analysis indicates that industry-level volatility contains better information about the future state of the economy than does aggregate stock market volatility. In Chapter 4, we explore a new but potentially important channel of crossborder information transmission between international stock markets &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; idiosyncratic volatility of stock returns. Specifically, we analyze the role of US and Japanese idiosyncratic volatility in transmitting information across three smaller but advanced Asia-Pacific stock markets &#8211; Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. We find that, similar to cross-market first and second moment return correlations, market-wide measures of IV are also highly correlated across countries. The effect of US and Japanese IV information is found to be much stronger on cross-market conditional volatility process than on the returns process. Further, we find significant contemporaneous and dynamic information transmission from IV of the US and Japan to the trading volume of other stock markets. Transmission of IV information, in general, seems to have gained momentum in the period since the Asian crisis of 1997. Overall evidence presented in this chapter is consistent with the interpretation that IV may contain information about some unobservable factors driving international stock market co-movement. In Chapter 5, we make the first attempt to understand the direct relationship between firm-specific variations in returns and firm fundamentals by analyzing firmlevel micro panel data in the context of each of a set of emerging Asian stock markets. After properly accounting for unobserved firm-specific effects, volatility persistence and potential endogeneity bias, we find that firm-specific variation of stock returns is highly correlated with, and is significantly explained by, alternative proxies of firm-specific variation of fundamentals in a majority of the emerging markets in Asia. Further analysis reveals that the observed effect of firm-specific fundamentals variation on returns variation is not indirectly driven by some other factors known to affect stock return volatility, viz., firm size, stock turnover, and leverage. Consistent with the rational approach, these results suggest that stock prices in majority of the Asian emerging markets are not devoid of fundamentals.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stocks</field><field name="subject">securities</field><field name="subject">rate of return</field><field name="subject">finance</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">capital assets pricing model</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/20115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effectiveness of low-Dye taping and calf muscle stretching for plantar heel pain</field><field name="creator">Radford, Joel A.</field><field name="description">Plantar heel pain is a common disorder that can involve considerable pain. Many treatments have been suggested to manage the condition however few have been rigorously evaluated. Two treatments commonly recommended in clinical practice are adhesive taping applied to the foot and calf muscle stretching. The effectiveness of neither treatment is supported by good quality evidence. Aim: To examine the effectiveness of two short-term interventions, low-Dye taping and calf muscle stretching, for the treatment of plantar heel pain. In addition, the effect of the interventions on biomechanical variables was investigated. Design: Four studies were undertaken in the thesis. The first study in the thesis (Chapter 3) investigated the biomechanical effect of low-Dye taping on the lower limb by systematically reviewing appropriate clinical trials. Meta-analyses were undertaken where appropriate. The second study (Chapter 4) was a blinded randomised trial conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of low-Dye taping for the short-term treatment of plantar heel pain. The third study (Chapter 5) investigated the effect of calf muscle stretching on ankle joint range of motion by systematically reviewing appropriate clinical trials. Meta analyses were again undertaken where appropriate. The fourth and final study (Chapter 6) was another blinded randomised trial conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of calf muscle stretching for the short-term treatment of plantar heel pain. Setting: Both randomised trials were conducted at a university-based clinic in Sydney, Australia. Participants In the randomised trials, 184 participants who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for plantar heel pain were recruited from the local community. In the first trial 92 participants were evaluated over a one-week period and randomly allocated to receive either low-Dye taping or a sham intervention. In the second trial 92 participants were evaluated over a two-week period and randomly allocated to receive either calf muscle stretching or a sham intervention. Outcome measures In the first systematic review, all trials that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria evaluated the effect of low-Dye taping on kinematic, kinetic and electromyographic outcomes. For the second systematic review, all trials that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria examined the effect of calf muscle stretching on the outcome of ankle joint dorsiflexion range of motion. Both randomised trials in this thesis used the Visual Analogue Scale and the Foot Health Status Questionnaire as primary outcomes. In the stretching randomised trial secondary outcomes were also assessed, namely the Foot Posture Index-6 and the Ankle Lunge Test. Results: The first systematic review found that low-Dye taping provides a small, statistically significant increase in navicular height immediately after application (weighted mean difference 5.90mm; 95% confidence interval 0.41 to 11.39; p=0.04)1 indicating a reduction in foot pronation. However, after exercise, taping had no statistically significant effect on navicular height (weighted mean difference 4.70mm; 95% confidence interval &#8211;0.61 to 10.01; p=0.08). In addition, taping had no statistically significant effect on maximum rear foot eversion (weighted mean difference &#8211;0.59&#176;; 95% confidence interval &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;2.53 to 1.35; p=0.55) or total rear foot range of motion while walking (weighted mean difference 2.3&#176;; 95% confidence interval &#8211;0.64 to 5.24; p=0.13). The first randomised trial found that low-Dye taping had a significantly greater decrease in &#8216;first-step&#8217; pain compared to a control group. The estimate of the mean difference between the groups (measured on 100mm Visual Analogue Scale) favoured the taping group (-12.3mm; 95% confidence interval -22.4 to -2.2; p=0.017). There 1 P values are provided to three decimal places except when values were generated using systematic review software, Review Manager 4.2.7, which sometimes only calculates results to two decimal places. were no differences detected in any of the other outcome measures. The taping was associated with mild to moderate short-lived adverse events that could be minimised with the use of hypoallergenic tape and careful application of the tape to reduce tightness. The second systematic review found that calf muscle stretching provides a small, statistically significant increase in ankle joint dorsiflexion. Stretching for &#8804;15 minutes (in a single session or accumulated over multiple sessions) provides a weighted mean difference of 2.07&#176; (95% confidence interval 0.86 to 3.27; p(less than)0.001). 15 to 30 minutes (accumulated over multiple sessions) increased dorsiflexion by a weighted mean difference of 3.03&#176; (95% confidence interval 0.31 to 5.75; p=0.03), and &gt;30 minutes of stretching (accumulated over multiple sessions) increased dorsiflexion by a weighted mean difference of 2.49&#176; (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 4.82; p=0.04) indicating no further increase in dorsiflexion is achieved by stretching for &gt;30 minutes. The second randomised trial found that calf muscle stretching compared to a control group, had no significant effect on &#8216;first-step&#8217; pain, foot pain, foot function or general foot health. Stretching was associated with mild to moderate adverse effects that were short-lived once stretching ceased. Conclusion: When used for the treatment of plantar heel pain, low-Dye taping provides a small increase in navicular height, and after one week, produces a small reduction in the &#8216;first-step&#8217; pain. Calf muscle stretching increases ankle joint dorsiflexion approximately 2 to 3 degrees but has no effect on plantar heel pain after two weeks. It can therefore be concluded that low-Dye taping is effective for the short-term treatment of the &#8216;first-step&#8217; pain associated with plantar heel pain, but calf muscle stretching is not effective for plantar heel pain.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">foot</field><field name="subject">ankle</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">physical therapy</field><field name="subject">podiatry</field><field name="subject">bandages and bandaging</field><field name="subject">muscle strength</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/20153</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The big-fish-little-pond effect under the grill : tests of its universality, a search for moderators, and the role of social comparison</field><field name="creator">Seaton, Marjorie</field><field name="description">High-ability students will provide future leadership in many fields of endeavour. However, the current practice of educating high-ability students in academically selective classes and schools may not provide the optimum environments for all such students. Big-fish-little-pond effect (BFLPE) research has demonstrated that students in high-ability environments have lower academic self-concepts than equally able students in low-ability settings. Low academic self-concepts are associated with negative educational outcomes. The present investigation aimed to extend current BFLPE theory and research by: (a) testing the BFLPE&#8217;s external validity across 41 countries to ascertain the theory&#8217;s universality; (b) testing whether the BFLPE is evident in developing countries and in collectivist countries to ascertain whether it transcends cultural and economic barriers; (c) investigating constructs that have the potential to moderate the adverse effects of the BFLPE; (d) elucidating whether upward social comparisons moderate or co-exist with the BFLPE to resolve a conflict in the literature; (e) critically analysing the relation between social comparison processes and the BFLPE to further inform theory; and (f) testing whether the BFLPE varies as a function of ability to clarify its impact on different ability levels. Three studies were conducted to achieve these aims.  Study 1 assessed the BFLPE&#8217;s external validity and investigated potential BFLPE moderators. Participants were 265,180 15-year-old students who took part in the 2003 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2005a, 2005b). The BFLPE was evident in the entire cross-national sample of 41 culturally and economically diverse countries, and individually in 38. Moderating effects emerged for socio-economic status (SES), individual differences in learning, and individual perceptions of the learning environment. However, in relation to the large sample these effects were considered small. A larger moderating effect emerged for anxiety, where the BFLPE was found to be greater for highly anxious students. Study 2 was designed to resolve an apparent contradiction between the social comparison and the BFLPE literatures. Previously published social comparison data (Blanton, Buunk, Gibbons, and Kuyper, 1999; Huguet, Dumas, Monteil, and Genestoux, 2001) were further analysed to ascertain whether the BFLPE was moderated by, or co-existed with, with the beneficial effects of upward comparisons on performance. Participants were 876 Dutch and 1,156 French students. The BFLPE was moderated for Dutch language, but for all other academic subjects it co-existed with selected upward comparisons. Study 3 assessed the effect of selected comparisons on the BFLPE. Participants were 2,015 French students. The BFLPE was found to co-exist with selected comparisons measured subjectively and when measured objectively for math. The BFLPE was moderated by comparison choice in French when measured objectively and by a performance avoidance goal orientation. The moderating effect of individual ability was tested in all three studies, but provided only small effects, inconsistent in direction. These results define the BFLPE as externally valid and universally applicable and suggest that it is not moderated by selected social comparisons. Results regarding BFLPE moderators offer practical information to inform intervention strategies that may assist high-ability students to reach their full academic potential.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gifted children</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">educational psychology</field><field name="subject">academic achievement</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">self-perception</field><field name="subject">motivation in education</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/20198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ancient Egyptian linen : the role of natron and other salts in the preservation and conservation of archaeolgical textiles : a pilot study</field><field name="creator">Marsh-Letts, Glennda Susan</field><field name="description">An understanding of the physical and chemical nature of archaeological textiles is an important prerequisite for their successful conservation treatment, display and storage. Ancient Egyptian linen textiles were examined through a combination of optical microscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), ion chromatography (IC), and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA). These analytical techniques were used to distinguish between flax fibres, foreign matter present on and within flax fibres, and natron or other salts absorbed into the linen fibres in a form of partial mineralization. The use of ESEM enabled the observation and recording of the movement of salts, in real time, during cycles of hydration and dehydration. Few studies have been undertaken to date on the dynamics of salt crystallisation within organic archaeological materials, and none previous to this has been published showing the dynamics of salt crystallisation within archaeological textiles. Once the dynamics of salt crystallisation were viewed and recorded it became possible to investigate methods for the treatment of salt affected textiles through washing trials followed by alternative methods of drying. The release of salts from linen samples during washing in deionized water was monitored using IC and ESEM with EDXA, showing the pattern of salt removal and retention. The use of IC, ESEM and EDXA to monitor salt removal in textiles has not previously been reported. A conservation treatment for ancient Egyptian linen was developed, incorporating a long water washing to remove salts, soils and organic deposits, followed immediately by carefully controlled freeze drying. This was effective in preserving the integrity of the ancient linen. By combining archaeological, historical and chemical data, this pilot study of the effects of salts upon and within linen textiles has widened our understanding of the role played by salts in both the deterioration and the preservation of the textiles.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">linen preservation</field><field name="subject">natron</field><field name="subject">ancient textile fabrics</field><field name="subject">Egypt antiquities</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/20291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and mathematical investigation into aspects of spatial involute gearing</field><field name="creator">Killeen, Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis is a small part of a much larger work, the aim of which is to continue the transition from gear theory to gear practice. The thesis deals with some aspects of the testing and theoretical development of equiangular and plain polyangular gears respectively. Initial prototypes of the equiangular spatial involute gearing, a small subset of a general spatial involute gear set, developed in previous works are to be tested for both function and form. The tests, based on the principles of the single flank gear tester, investigate constancy of transmission ratio and use both electronic and mechanical means. The former of these highlights the shortcomings of some aspects of the experimental set up. Algebraic expressions are also developed for plain polyangular gearing, a more general form of spatial involute gearing. These equations demonstrate the links to the underlying kinematic principles and are, consequently, more robust. This is verified by their application to both the equiangular and plain polyangular cases. The expressions were checked by comparing their results to graphical and numerical models developed concurrently with the algebraic expressions. Initial investigations are also undertaken into turning the mathematical theory into gear machining theory.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gearing, spur</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/20408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Meeting country : deep engagement with place and indigenous culture</field><field name="creator">Birrell, Carol L.</field><field name="description">This thesis explores place-based experiences of non-Indigenous persons in Australia. It examines the extent to which it is possible for non-Indigenous persons to enter deeply into Indigenous ways of seeing and/or knowing place and what the implications of this may be in terms of personal identity and belonging in Australia today. The thesis draws upon the emerging cross-disciplinary field of place studies and is embedded in the discursive space of the encounter between Western and Indigenous knowledge systems. The Indigenous concept of ganma, meaning &#8216;meeting place&#8217;, the meeting of saltwater and freshwater bodies, is the organising principle by which the encounter is examined. Because place-based experiences are the central focus of this study, phenomenology has been chosen as the methodological framework that can hold the complexity, multilayered meaning and ambiguity characteristic of the human experience. What informs this research is a hermeneutic phenomenological inquiry. The specific methods used to carry through such an approach involve three aspects: observations of and conversations with Aboriginal Yuin Elder Uncle Max Harrison in order to shed light on the cross cultural experience; open-ended phenomenological interviews with four participants who received land-based teachings with the Elder aimed at bringing forth the quality of their experiences; and first person phenomenological research through different forms of textual production that reflect the nature of deep engagement and dialogue with place. The discussion chapters confirm the complexities of the encounter between two cultures yet demand a rethink of the intercultural space, the ganma. A new notion of ganma is proposed where a shared sense of place between Indigenous and non-Indigenous persons is Participants in the research had a powerful and profound embodied experience of Aboriginal culture, of Aboriginal place or country. These outcomes derive not through borrowing from or wholesale appropriation of another culture, but from direct experiencing and through direct dialogue. The nexus of the interchange is revealed to be an exceedingly complex structure. First, place is no blank space - it is inscribed and saturated with meaning. Country continues to exert its influence, inform, evolve and reveal itself. The potency of country is particularly strong when that site is a sacred site. Second, the influence of the Aboriginal Elder, as mediator of the teaching sites, has considerable impact. Third, the individual&#8217;s own psychic contents are brought to bear in any relationship with place. It is posited that an unhinging takes place that allows the shift from one mode of experiencing reality, a Western way of inhabiting the world, to another mode, an Indigenous way of being in the world. The venturer into the new ganma straddles both worlds, is able to adjust to the transfer of knowledge from one cultural context to another and adopts aspects of both cultures into their new conceptual framework. This new merging of the ancient and the modern incorporates place as inscribed with ancient meanings and place with new meanings and new inscriptions. Narratives of place embody the evolving notion of switching modes of reality to switching modes of being as new ongoing forms that challenge existing cultural explanations. The integration of an Aboriginal worldview in non-Indigenous persons may be leading towards the development of a new sensitivity that connects us with place, more informed by Indigenous ways of being.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">Australians</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">assimilation (sociology)</field><field name="subject">acculturation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">knowledge, sociology of</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/20459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'What makes a film tick?' : Cinematic affect, materiality and mimetic innervation</field><field name="creator">Rutherford, Anne</field><field name="description">This PhD explores questions of cinematic affect and its relationship to mimetic experience. Through an examination of cinematic materiality, it argues that film must be inscribed across the sensorium if it is to arouse affective experience for the spectator. Drawing on Miriam Hansen&#8217;s readings of Walter Benjamin and Siegfried Kracauer, the thesis argues that cinematic affect can most productively be understood in film as a process of mimetic innervation. The thesis is comprised of seven published essays and an overarching chapter. The introductory chapter, &#8216;A Paradigm Shift in Film Studies&#8217;, situates the published essays in the context of recent debates about embodied spectatorship and affect, arguing the need for a revision of key paradigms of film theory. The first series of essays argues the centrality of embodied affect to cinema spectatorship, and proposes a nexus between mimetic visuality, affect and mise-en- sc&#232;ne, linking the analysis of mise-en-sc&#232;ne to Kracauer&#8217;s discussions of cinematic materiality. The essays extend this nexus to rethink genre through the lens of affective mimetic experience, arguing that both genre and visual style work mimetically. The arguments are explored through studies of the work of Mizoguchi Kenji, Theodorus Angelopoulos and Lee Myung-Se. The second series examines spectatorship in documentary cinema, raising questions about historiography, embodied knowledge, inter-cultural dialogue, and the affective elements of cultural specificity. The essays interrogate the universalist claims of conventional documentary form, and its assumptions of a disembodied spectator. They contest the assumed opposition in documentary theory between affect and signification and draw affect and mimetic experience into the core conceptualisation of documentary film. The studies explore an Australian television documentary series, an Indonesian political docudrama and three hybrid documentaries&#8212;two Indian and one French.

Five hundred and five respondents completed the self-administered survey questionnaire. Out of the total 505 participants, 42% of the players reported PRMDs. The professional players (72%) reported a significantly higher incidence (p &lt; 0.05) of PRMDs in comparison with the non-professional group. The professional players with piano as their major instrument, using predominantly neutral wrist posture (i.e., open-kinetic chain playing technique), reported a significantly higher incidence of PRMDs. Although the present study showed a greater number of years of playing was associated with greater risk of PRMDs, the result also showed that the years of playing had no significant effect on the incidence of PRMDs (p &gt; .05) when it was analyzed with the practice hours within seven days. Moreover, analyzing the practice hours over seven days with the piano major/non-major instrument, the various grade levels and PRMDs; the results showed that the practice hours had no significant effect on the groups with and without PRMDs (p &gt; .05). Although women reported a significantly higher percentage of PRMDs (p &lt; 0.05) than men, there was no significant association between the groups with and without PRMDs when analyzing practice hours over seven days by grade levels and gender. The PRMDs seem to arise when overuse is compounded by misuse and/or adverse playing conditions. The best and safest practice would be to minimize consumption of musculoskeletal force production and combine this with effective practice-breaks between sessions to achieve the optimum goal of daily practice. Keywords: hand injury, PRMDs, wrist pain, hand-span size, playing-technique, and piano player.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pianists -- Wounds and injuries</field><field name="subject">Musculoskeletal system -- Wounds and injuries</field><field name="subject">Piano -- Technique</field><field name="subject">Piano -- Methods</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0090</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Qphyl System: a web-based interactive system for phylogenetic analysis</field><field name="creator">Zhen, Zhao</field><field name="description">Master of Science</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phylogenetic analysis, quartets, interaction, integration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/2691</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A fine balance</field><field name="creator">Sye, Jill</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to analyse the discourses drawn upon by community paediatric nurses in relation to children&#8217;s rights to health. The philosophy of Michel Foucault has been used to underpin the analysis of the interviews and exemplars of five experienced community nurses, revealing conflicting power relationships and discourses. Rights are formalised morality and so from a children&#8217;s rights perspective, discourses reflect both the moral and ethical positions of the nurses. Children are constructed as developing human beings whose moral status gradually changes and who, through a lack of developmental autonomy, entrust their decision-making to their representatives (parents and caregivers) as their trustees. Rights are correlative with the obligations and duties toward children by both families and society. Society constructs legislative and politically organised structures to govern raising children because children are an intrinsic social concern. Whilst representing society&#8217;s interest in children&#8217;s rights to health, nurses in the home act as a conduit for multiple governing structures. The nurses in this study construct their &#8220;truths&#8221; and knowledge about children&#8217;s health rights from nursing, medicine, law, education, and social policy. However, the values of individual parents can conflict with universal values for children&#8217;s health and wellbeing. Therefore representing society positions nurses as &#8220;agents of the state&#8221;, a role that potentially holds power over parents and children and leads to the epithet of &#8220;the health police&#8221;. Within the institution of the family, and in the privacy of the home, there are also mechanisms of power that can resist the mechanisms of the state and its representatives. Therefore the discourse &#8220;it takes a village to raise a child&#8221; competes with the &#8220;my home is my castle&#8221; discourse. Nurses negotiate a fine balance between these power relations. Nurses are challenged with using power productively to promote children&#8217;s rights whilst respecting the role of parents and families. I argue that children&#8217;s rights are central to the moral and ethical work of nurses but that such work is often obscured and invisible. I propose that children&#8217;s community nurses are excellent at negotiating networking and connecting at a micro level, but need to create a more sophisticated and cohesive entity at a macro level to become fully political children&#8217;s rights advocates.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Community children's nurses perceptions and practices</field><field name="subject">Childrens rights to health</field><field name="subject">Family centred care discourse</field><field name="subject">Child centred discourse</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing learning conversations : an action research model of reflective professional development : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Education, Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Harnett, Jennifer Anne</field><field name="description">A growing body of international research has indicated that teacher effectiveness is the most important factor affecting student achievement. At the heart of effective teaching and learning are learning conversations, in which teachers play a pivotal role in mediating learning by orchestrating discussion with students. This action research study had a dual purpose, firstly to investigate the effects of teachers&#8217; knowledge and thinking on their ability to mediate students&#8217; learning in classroom learning conversations, and secondly to provide the participating teachers with opportunities to investigate and develop their professional knowledge and practice. The action research approach allowed the collection of substantive information about teachers&#8217; thinking and practice, while at the same informing and developing that practice through cycles of data collection, analysis, and reflection. The study involved two New Zealand primary school teachers in four cycles of action research. Information was gathered about the teachers&#8217; knowledge, thinking, and practice through semi-structured interviews, classroom observations, and reflective journals. Observation transcripts were analysed, coded, discussed, and reflected upon during reflection days at the end of each cycle. The initial findings of the study revealed that although the two teachers were very different in their teaching styles, there were strong similarities in the fragmented nature of their knowledge of learning and assessment theory. Discrepancies were found between the teachers&#8217; espoused theories and their theories-in-use. In addition, the teachers&#8217; practice was strongly influenced by implicit beliefs and routinised behaviours, which had a powerful and often detrimental effect on the quality of their interactions with students. However, the process of examining the evidence in their own lesson transcripts enabled the teachers to develop awareness of weaknesses in their practice. This was a catalyst for reflection that resulted in change and improvement. After an initial regression both teachers made small but incremental changes in their interactions with students. By the end of the final cycle both teachers had appreciably improved the quality of their classroom learning conversations. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of classroom-based action research as a model for reflective professional development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">effective teaching</field><field name="subject">interaction analysis</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330300 Professional Development of Teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An affect-sensitive intelligent tutoring system with an animated pedagogical agent that adapts to student emotion like a human tutor : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Alexander, Samuel Thomas Vaughan</field><field name="description">One of the established strengths of human tutors is their ability to recognise and adapt to the emotions of students. This is a skill that has traditionally been lacking from Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs); despite their ability to intelligently model and adapt to aspects of the student&#8217;s cognitive state, ITSs are generally completely unable to detect or adapt to aspects of the student&#8217;s affective state. In response to this shortcoming, this thesis explores the pioneering development of an emotion-sensitive ITS. With the empathy of effective human tutors as our blueprint, we investigate how an artificial tutor should adapt to the affective state of students, and develop an original affective tutoring strategies method. As a validation of the feasibility of an emotion-sensitive tutoring system, we implement and test our method in a functional Affective Tutoring System (ATS) for counting and addition, Easy with Eve, featuring an empathetic animated pedagogical agent, Eve. Eve is able to detect student affect using an in-house real time facial expression analysis system. To inform the system&#8217;s adaptation to student affect, the novel method for student modelling and emotion-sensitive tutoring strategies has been developed using a fuzzy, case-based reasoning approach. This approach is used to mine data about human tutor adaptations to student affect that was generated by an observational study of human tutors that was carried out in a local primary school. To test the impact of emotion detection and the presence of the animated agent, four different versions of the ATS were tested in local primary schools with a total of 59 participants. The findings from the study indicate that adding the detection of facial expressions to the student model did not improve student short-term performance, but there was mixed evidence that the presence of the animated agent Eve may cause students to perceive the system slightly more positively (a persona effect). This effect was marginally greater when the animated agent was enabled to detect and adapt to the affective state of students, which tentatively shows that emotion detection in an ATS may have a positive effect on student motivation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer-assisted instruction</field><field name="subject">intelligent tutoring systems</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280210 Simulation and modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/676</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The entrepreneurial capital of SMEs and business compliance in New Zealand : a study of the relationship : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Public Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">de Bruin-Judge, Robyn Leigh</field><field name="description">Despite New Zealand receiving the number one ranking for ease of doing business in a major international comparative survey of compliance requirements, SME owners continue to rate compliance as a significant concern. This research project set out to investigate why this was so. The qualitative research undertaken for this thesis involved case study interviews with six SME owners. A resource-based approach was taken, looking at the resources SME owners needed to address the compliance task, and how they sourced and applied these. The scope of the study extended beyond the confines of the workplace to encompass the impact of compliance on the personal lives of SME owners and their families. Firkin&#8217;s model of entrepreneurial capital was applied and extended. Accordingly, the study encompassed an examination of economic, human, social, cultural and personal capital. An original concept, temporal capital, was developed to address the application of &#8216;potentially productive time&#8217; as a resource. The findings are applied to a discussion of the Quality Regulation Review currently underway in New Zealand. It is recommended that SME issues could be more comprehensively addressed by incorporating screens within the Business Cost Calculator that estimate the relative psychic and opportunity costs associated with proposed regulations. A gender analysis of the compliance task was also undertaken. This revealed that the impact of compliance measures may be disproportionately borne by those whose business and personal lives are intertwined, primarily women. The invisibility of these workers has contributed to their needs being inadequately addressed by traditional processes of consultation and data analysis. The thesis concludes that it is not the regulatory regime alone that determines ease of doing business. It is the match between the requirements of the regime and the compliance-related entrepreneurial capital accessible to those subject to it. Recommendations relate therefore, to improving both the institutional capital of the regulator and the compliance-related entrepreneurial capital accessible to the SME.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">business cost calculator</field><field name="subject">compliance</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">social capital</field><field name="subject">cultural capital</field><field name="subject">gender analysis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360201 Public policy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics and practices of work-based learning : accounts of experiences in the community services sector</field><field name="creator">Houlbrook, Michael C.</field><field name="description">This thesis is a phenomenological study of the experiences of students engaged in a work-based learning (WBL) degree in the community service (CS) sector in NSW. The degree &#8211; a graduate diploma in social sciences (GDSS) - was developed through an industry/community partnership in response to identified workforce development needs. Positioned as a novel pedagogy, WBL is presented in the broad context, before the specifics of the research are outlined. The thesis presents, first, a political economy of higher education (HE) and the CS sector, followed by a description of the defining principles of WBL, characteristics of practice and issues arising from these things. The phenomenological study of the student experiences is supported by a case study of the GDSS. The research is approached from an ontological and epistemological framework informed by critical theory and critical hermeneutics. The methods draw substantially on data collection through semi-structured interviews and supporting data collected form other sources. The analysis of the data is presented as five major data stories &#8211; access, self and study, work-based learning and organisation, managing learning and outcomes. In discussing the data the thesis argues that the students are strongly positioned as non-traditional students with an orientation towards issues of access to HE, as well as a concern with critical practice. The concluding comments of the thesis consider the context of work-based learning under systemic influences of the political economy of the day, notably neo-liberalism and the application of a techno-economic framing of the knowledge economy. Some final comments are offered on the practice of WBL in the CS sector, including the defence of knowledge production as a public good and the life world/system dynamics of partnership.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social work education</field><field name="subject">social sciences</field><field name="subject">study and teaching (higher)</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">education, cooperative</field><field name="subject">community and college</field><field name="subject">work-based learning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/20801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proteomics of the human alcoholic brain: Implications for the pathophysiology of alcohol-related brain damage</field><field name="creator">Alexander-Kaufman, Kimberley Louise</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alcohol-related brain damage</field><field name="subject">proteomics</field><field name="subject">thiamine deficiency</field><field name="subject">neuropathology</field><field name="subject">Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome</field><field name="subject">2D gel electrophresis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/2692</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expressibility of higher-order logics on relational databases : proper hierarchies : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Systems at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio</field><field name="description">We investigate the expressive power of different fragments of higher-order logics over finite relational structures (or equivalently, relational databases) with special emphasis in higher-order logics of order greater than or equal three.

During which, computer technology has transformed the world from the industrial age to the information age. Computer technology by its very nature is a new and intriguing phenomenon to work with. In contrast, nursing by its very nature is an older and most trusted profession to be part of. Uncovering the secrets of combining this media and that profession then became the challenge for the study. The foundations for the study are set within the qualitative model of phenomenology, where the methods are based on the work of van Manen (1997). This framework was used to explore a deeper understanding of the nursing experience with computer technology in the hospital ward. The objectives of the study were primarily to understand computer technology within the social context of nursing and secondly, other objectives were to explore the dynamics, between computer technology and the culture of nursing. Discussion was invited on the positive and negative influences of computer technology as experienced by these nurses.This was achieved by working with nurses in a variety of ward settings including a rural base hospital, as they participated in a series of in-depth, unstructured interviews. The data they provided reflects that computer technology has the potential to impact on the structure and delivery of healthcare, challenge the traditional roles and scope of practice, alter the existing boundaries and relationships and reinvent the clinical environment of nursing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computers</field><field name="subject">computer technology; nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004282/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inclined load capacity of suction caisson in clay</field><field name="creator">Supachawarote, Chairat</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the capacity and failure mode of suction caissons under inclined loading. Parametric finite element analyses have been carried out to investigate the effects of caisson geometry, loading angle, padeye depth (i.e. load attachment point), soil profile and caisson-soil interface condition. Displacement-controlled analyses were carried out to determine the ultimate limit state of the suction caissons under inclined load and the results presented as interaction diagrams in VH load space. VH failure interaction diagrams are presented for both cases where the caisson-soil interface is fully-bonded and where a crack is allowed to form along the side of the caisson. An elliptical equation is fitted to the normalised VH failure interaction diagram to describe the general trend in the case where the caisson-soil interface is fully-bonded. Parametric study reveals that the failure envelope in the fully-bonded case could be scaled down (contracted failure envelope) to represent the holding capacity when a crack is allowed to form. A stronger effect of crack on the capacity was observed in the lightly overconsolidated soil, compared to the normally consolidated soil. The sensitivity of caisson capacity to the changes in load attachment position or loading angle was quantified based on the load-controlled analyses. It was found that, for caisson length to diameter ratios of up to 5, the optimal centreline loading depth (i.e. where the caisson translates with no rotation) is in the range 0.65L to 0.7L in normally consolidated soil, but becomes shallower for the lightly overconsolidated soil profile where the shear strength profile is more uniform. The reduction of holding capacity when the padeye position is shifted from the optimal location was also quantified for normally consolidated and lightly overconsolidated soil profiles at loading angle of 30 [degrees]. Upper bound analyses were carried out to augment the finite element study. Comparison of holding capacity and accompanying failure mechanisms obtained from the finite element and upper bound methods are made. It was found that the upper bound generally overpredicted the inclined load capacity obtained from the finite element analyses especially for the shorter caisson considered in this study. A correction factor is introduced to adjust the upper bound results for the optimal condition. Comparisons of non-optimal capacity were also made and showed that the agreement between the upper bound and finite element analyses are sensitive to the change in the centreline loading depth when the caisson-soil interface is fully bonded, but less so when a crack forms.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Caissons</field><field name="subject">Soil mechanics</field><field name="subject">Suction caisson</field><field name="subject">Inclined loading</field><field name="subject">Finite element analysis</field><field name="subject">Failure envelopes</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">My Crystal Diary (MCD) : an integrated software application for recording the observations and results of crystallisation experiments</field><field name="creator">Mooranian, Mahsa</field><field name="description">Recent technological advances in computer science have contributed to immense data generation in many critical areas of biology.

My concern is that models currently underpinning understanding and practice in grief recovery provide limited assistance to loss and grief practioners. These theories, based around set stages and tasks with pre-determined objectives, offer stereotypic "after the event" perspectives on the recovery process. This has value as background information, but in the extreme promotes a clinical, de-personalised approach to uderstanding and support. My experiences over more than a decade of working alongside the suicide-bereaved in particular, suggest that a more enlightened pathway lies with people and their stories. Working in an empathic dialogic relationship, with an emphasis on understanding rather than closure, is more appropriate in assisting those treading the very sensitive, very personal, bereavement path. Furthermore, the narrative grounded approach is more in tune with the processes involved; and more likely to lead to productive outcomes in both the short and long term.The presented model argues that bereavement recovery is a re-educative reconstruction process: trialogic, semiotic sign or symbol related; recognising significant personal autonomous control; genetically or organically activated and driven; dynamic and ongoing; and constructed out of the individual's socio-cultural knowledge base. The model further argues that recovery is best constructed in a climate of empathic understanding and genuine non-judgemental acceptance of the bereaved individual's current perceptual world.

This study investigates how two teachers taught introductory differential calculus to their Year 11 classes using multiple representations in a CAS-supported curriculim. This thesis aism to explore the impact of the teaching on students' understanding of the concept of derivative. Understanding the concept of derivative was gauged using an innovative Differentiation Competency Framework that was developed to describe understanding of the concept of derivative. It consist of eighteen competencies for formulation and interpretation of derivatives with, and without, translation between different representations. It clarifies the objectives of the curriculim, purpose for using particular CAS activities, and also guided the construction of individual test items on the Differentiation Competency Test that enabled individual and class learning about the concept of derivative to be identified. The framework also helped identify each teacher's privileging characteristics and facilitated analysis of the learning in relation to the teaching. This study found that using multiple representations was important in developing understanding of the concept of derivative but that the graphical and the symbolic representations were the most useful and important to emphasize and link. Analysis of the teaching actions showed that the teachers used CAS in ways that were consistent with their teaching approach and preferred use of representations and that a conceptual teaching method and student-centred style supported understanding of the concept of derivative. Teaching is directly linked to learning and each class developed a different understanding of the concept of derivative that related to the combined effect of their teacher's privileging characteristics: calculus content, teaching approach, and use of CAS. This study shows that if a CAS-supported curriculum is to be successfully implemented, it needs to acquire institutional status including a corresponding change in assessment to legitimize new teaching practices.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Alegbra Systems (CAS), Year 11 Mathematics, Derivative, Mathematics Curriculum</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000299/01/Kendal.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New fluorite-type Bi2O3-based solid electrolytes : characterisation, conductivity and crystallography</field><field name="creator">Webster, Nathan A. S.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] New, double-doped, Bi2O3-based materials in the Bi2O3  Ln2O3  PbO (Ln = La, Nd, Er and Yb) and Bi2O3  WO3  PbO systems were prepared using solid-state reactions. For the Bi2O3  Er2O3  PbO and Bi2O3  Yb2O3  PbO systems, the air-quenchable compositional domain of the fcc fluorite-type phase was partially established. Temperature dependent conductivity measurements were performed on these quenched-in fluorite-type materials using AC impedance spectroscopy. Conductivity at 750[degrees Celsius] generally increased with increasing Pb2+/Ln3+ and decreasing (Ln3++Pb2+)/Bi3+ ratios. The material (BiO1.5)0.70(ErO1.5)0.15(PbO)0.15 had a conductivity of 0.66 [plus-minus] 0.05 S cm-1 at 750[degrees Celsius], placing it among the most highly conductive Bi2O3-based materials, and was the best new fluorite-type material from a combined conductivity and structural stability viewpoint. Some of the new materials in the Bi2O3  La2O3  PbO and Bi2O3  Nd2O3  PbO systems appeared to have the quenched-in fluorite type structure based on powder X-ray diffraction data. These materials had very high conductivities at 750[degrees Celsius] of `~ 1 S cm-1, but underwent rapid symmetry lowering transformations during heating, thus making them unsuitable for use as solid electrolytes. The fluorite-type structure was not air-quenchable in the Bi2O3  WO3  PbO system, for the compositions synthesised. Room temperature neutron powder diffraction data were collected for quenched-in fluorite-type materials in the (BiO1.5)0.80(LnO1.5)0.20-x(PbO)x, Ln = Er and Yb, x = 0, 0.03, 0.06 and 0.09, and (BiO1.5)0.97-y(ErO1.5)y(PbO)0.03, y = 0.27, 0.17 and 0.12, series. ... This suggests that Pb2+ dopant cations occupy face-centre positions in the fcc unit cell, and the Pb2+ lone pair electrons are likely to be orientated towards an oxide ion vacancy in an adjacent tetrahedral site. Pb2+/oxide ion vacancy interactions affect the migration of oxide ions/oxide ion vacancies through the structure, and are responsible for the significantly larger activation energy for oxide ion migration in the Pb2+-doped materials relative to the Pb2+-free materials. For example, the activation energies of (BiO1.5)0.80(ErO1.5)0.20-x(PbO)x, x = 0.03 and 0.06, were 1.50 [plus-minus] 0.02 and 1.54 [plus-minus] 0.02 eV, respectively, while the activation energy for (BiO1.5)0.80(ErO1.5)0.20 was 1.25 [plus-minus] 0.04 eV. Long-term annealing of the quenched in fluorite-type materials in the Bi2O3  Er2O3  PbO and Bi2O3  Yb2O3  PbO systems at 500 and 600[degrees Celsius] resulted in conductivity lowering structural transformations, making these materials unsuitable for practical use as solid electrolytes at these temperatures. For example, the materials (BiO1.5)0.80(ErO1.5)0.20-x(PbO)x, x = 0.03, 0.06 and 0.09, underwent a fluorite-type to tetragonal transformation during annealing at 500[degrees Celsius] due to &lt;100&gt; oxide ion vacancy ordering, and the rate of conductivity decay at 500[degrees Celsius] increased with increasing Pb2+/Er3+ ratio. Long-term annealing experiments at 500[degrees Celsius] performed on air quenched (Bi2O3)0.705(Er2O3)0.245(WO3)0.050 showed that the disordered fluorite-type structure of this material was not fully stabilised, as evidenced by the presence of superlattice reflections in selected area electron diffraction patterns for the material annealed for 2000 hours, and a gradual conductivity decay after ~ 150 hours annealing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bismuth trioxide</field><field name="subject">Electrolytes -- Conductivity</field><field name="subject">Quenched-in fluorite type structure</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0092</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Separating Romans and barbarians : rural settlement and Romano-British material culture in North Britain</field><field name="creator">Wright, Nigel Richard Reginald</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the role which Roman artefacts played within rural settlements in North Britain during the Romano-British period. The possibility that Roman artefacts were used by native Britons as markers of prestige is explored through the presence or absence of Roman artefact types. The more prestigious the occupants of the rural settlements were, the more likely they were to have access to a variety of exotic trade items. The methodology employed in this study has been adapted from previous studies on pottery types and settlement remains from Scotland. This thesis examines an area that centres on Hadrian's Wall, which at various times in its history acted as the frontier for the Roman Empire, as well as being a staging post for troops and a means of controlling the local population's movement. The study region includes land up to 50 kilometres either side of Hadrian's Wall, and examines rural settlements located within one or two days travel from the Wall. The excavation reports of rural settlements were examined, and include settlement types such as homesteads, hillforts and villas. From these sites, Roman artefact types were quantified and used to generate data for analysis. The results agree with the hypothesis that social hierarchy can be detected through the comparative presence or absence of Roman artefact types. It is also apparent that the settlements on either side of Hadrian's Wall, and either side of the Pennines mountain chain, were not part of a simple, homogenous culture. This thesis begins with an outline of the geographic and environmental nature of the region (Chapter 2), and an examination of settlement and society in North Britain during the preceding Bronze and Iron Ages (Chapter 3). An essay on Romano-British society and settlement is included (Chapter 4), and is followed by a brief discussion of post- Roman Britain (Chapter 5). Following an outline of the methodology used (Chapter 6), the results of analysis are presented in detail (Chapter 7). The Discussion chapter explores how the results of analysis meet existing theories of rural settlement and society, and compares North Britain with continental data from Germany and North Gaul (Chapter 8).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Land settlement -- Great Britain -- Roman period, 55 B.C-449 A.D</field><field name="subject">Romans -- Great Britain</field><field name="subject">Great Britain -- Antiquities, Roman</field><field name="subject">Great Britain -- History -- Roman period, 55 B.C.-449 A.D</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimations of power system frequency, phasors and their applications for fault location on power transmission lines</field><field name="creator">Li, Xiaojuan</field><field name="description">The thesis is devoted to the development of new algorithms for estimation of system frequency, power system phasors and transmission line fault location in the context of power system protection and control. A z-transform signal model combined with a nonlinear post-filtering scheme to estimate the operating frequency in a power system is first developed in the thesis. The signal model parameters are identified by an optimisation method in which the error between the model output and the actual signal that represents a voltage or current in the power system is minimised. The form and the structure of the signal model do not require iterations in the optimisation process for parameter identification. The system operating frequency is directly evaluated from the model parameters. Effects of noise and any frequency components other than the operating or supply-frequency on the accuracy are countered very effectively by applying a median post-filtering on the time series representing the frequency estimates derived from the model. Extensive simulation studies and comparisons with previously-published frequency estimation techniques confirm the high performance of the method developed in the thesis in terms of accuracy and time delay. With respect to power system phasor estimation, a method is developed based on waveform interpolation in the discrete time-domain to counter the spectral leakage errors arising in forming, by discrete Fourier transform (DFT), the supply frequency phasors representing power system voltages and currents when there are system frequency deviations from the nominal value. The interpolation scheme allows DFT evaluation to be performed with a time window length which is exactly equal to the fundamental period of the voltage or current waveform. Comparative studies presented in the thesis confirm the improvements achieved by the method proposed over other previouslypublished techniques in terms of accuracy and computing time. With the availability of accurate operating frequency and phasor estimates, an optimal fault location method based on multi-conductor distributedparameter line model is developed. The method is a general one which is applicable to any transmission line configurations, including multi-terminal lines. The fault location method is based on the minimisation of an objective function in which the fault distance is a variable. The objective function is formed from combining the phase-variable distributed-parameter equations of individual line sections from the fault point to the line terminals. The multivariable minimisation leads to high accuracy and robustness of the fault location algorithm in which any voltage/current measurement errors, including sampling time synchronisation errors, are represented in the estimation procedure as variables in addition to the fault distance. Extensive simulation studies are performed to verify that the method developed is highly accurate and robust.

Once discharged to the community for continuation of wound management for pressure ulcers, the epidemiology of these patients, together with patients who develop pressure ulcers at home, is unknown. Aims a) To estimate the magnitude of the problem of pressure ulcers in the Northern Sydney Home Nursing Service (NSHNS). b) To examine the evidence for inclusion of parameters in pressure ulcer risk screening tools and establish the frequency of use for patients identified with pressure ulcers. c) To test for differences in outcome in patients who have developed pressure ulcers either in hospital or in the community. Methodology A retrospective review of hospital and community records of patients identified with pressure ulcers, during a prevalence survey in May 2002, was carried out. All patients were followed for 12 months or to healing of the pressure ulcers. Results Nineteen patients, eight male and 11 female, median age 80 years, developed 41 pressure ulcers. Patients developed between one and seven pressure ulcers with a ratio of 2.2 per patient. The majority (14/19, 73%) of pressure ulcers developed in the community with just over one quarter (5/19, 26%) in hospital. Only three of 19 (15.7%) patients were screened for pressure ulcer risk. Pressure ulcers took an average of 70 days to heal. An estimated 1563 community nurse visits were required for wound management of the 41 pressure ulcers in 19 study patients. One patient was still being treated for a pressure ulcer at the end of the 12-month study period. Four patients were discharged and nine (47%) died. Conclusion The prevalence of pressure ulcers is a rare adverse event in the NSHNS. Screening tools were not used to identify those at risk. Interventions to prevent pressure ulcers did not occur until after the development of pressure ulcers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bedsores</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wireless network caching scheme for a cost saving wireless data access</field><field name="creator">Wang, Jerry Chun-Ping, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Recent widespread use of computer and wireless communication technologies has increased the demand of data services via wireless channels. However, providing high data rate in wireless system is expensive due to many technical and physical limitations. Unlike voice service, data service can tolerate delays and allow burst transfer of information, thus, an alternative approach had to be formulated. This approach is known as ???Infostation.??? Infostation is an inexpensive, high speed wireless disseminator that features discontinuous coverage and high radio transmission rate by using many short-distance high bandwidth local wireless stations in a large terrain. As opposed to ubiquitous networks, each infostation provides independent wireless connectivity at relative  shorter distance compare to traditional cellular network. However, due to the discontinuous nature of infostation network, there is no data service available between stations, and the clients become completely disconnected from the outside world. During, the disconnected period, the clients have to access information locally. Thus, the need for a good wireless network caching scheme has arisen.   In this dissertation, we explore the use of the infostation model for disseminating and caching of data. Our initial approach focuses on large datasets that exhibit hierarchical structure. In order to facilitate information delivery, we exploit the hierarchical nature of the file structure, then propose generic content scheduling and cache management strategies for infostations. We examine the performance of our proposed strategies with the network simulator Qualnet. Our simulation results demonstrate the improvement in increasing the rate of successful data access, thus alleviating excessive waiting overheads during disconnected periods. Moreover, our technique allows infostations to be combined with traditional cellular networks and avoid accessing data via scarce and expensive wireless channel for the purpose of cost reduction.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">infostation</field><field name="subject">wireless caching</field><field name="subject">infostation-cellular integration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ontological status of Pirandello???s metacharacters: six characters in search of a Platonic author</field><field name="creator">Sarrinikolaou, Irene, School of Media, Film &amp; Theatre, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes that a defining feature of Pirandello???s 1921 play ??? Six Characters in Search of an Author, is a relentless transcendentalism. It argues that the play embodies a fascination with existential and conceptual ???occult???, and my hypothesis is that by exploring Pirandello's transcendentalism we may enhance our understanding of how and why Pirandello's play points a mirror up to the invisible and suggests that we could be a reflection of that. Pirandello's drama alludes to some of the most convoluted and enduring debates in western philosophy. However, there is very little English-language material on Pirandello???s relation to philosophy or the relevance of analytical philosophy, metaphysics or epistemology to Pirandello???s playwriting. Even foreign-language studies focus on existentialism, phenomenology and other Continental traditions of philosophy. My contribution is to craft a subjective response to Six Characters in accordance with the methods of analytical philosophy, making use of paradigms and techniques that stem from aesthetics and metaphysics to elucidate a complex self-reflexive play. Chapter One presents analytical philosophy as a potential interpretative framework for the play, whereas chapters two and three explore the metacharacters specifically.

Requirements selection decisions are made by reconciling the conflicting stakeholders??? value propositions into a mutually-agreed set through the negotiation and communication process between stakeholders. Firstly, this study identified decision-making criteria according to different stakeholders??? value propositions, and then evaluated the importance of the criteria when making the decisions of requirements selection. Moreover, the study determined the degree to which the stakeholders from business, product, and project perspectives influence the decision-making process. Furthermore, the study explored the communication between major stakeholders in requirements selection process, as a foundation to support and guide the process. A Delphi survey was applied in this study. Opinions from experienced industrial experts were obtained to achieve reliable consensus among them on the criteria and relative importance of the criteria in requirements selection process. The Delphi survey in this study included four phases of data collection by a series of intensive questionnaires interspersed with controlled opinion feedback and follow-up interviews. 132 Experts from 11 companies were recruited by following the rigid procedure to ensure the validity and reliability of the research. The study indicated that criteria from the business perspective had a major influence on decision-making of requirements selection, while project- and product-perspective criteria were relatively lower in priority. However, there were some inconsistencies among the opinions of the recruited experts regarding the importance of the criteria. The inconsistencies may result from a number of different factors, for example; different software development projects; different size, culture, organizational structure or maturity level of the companies; or different working positions of the experts surveyed.  In addition, the study found three different types of communication in requirements selection in the companies surveyed. Further, Chinese culture was believed to have effects on the communication process between stakeholders. While informal communication was highlighted in Chinese context, the Chinese culture of strictly hierarchical communication could lead to problems in the communication process. Further research is recommended to gain deeper insight into these issues.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Software - Economic aspects</field><field name="subject">Computer software - Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Computer software - Development - Costs - China</field><field name="subject">Multiple criteria decision making</field><field name="subject">Acquisition of computer software</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25980</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The decorative in twentieth century art: a story of decline and resurgence.</field><field name="creator">Gaunt, Pamela Mary, School of Art History/Theory, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis tracks the complex relationship between visual art and the decorative in the Twentieth Century. In doing so, it makes a claim for the ongoing interest and viability of decorative practices within visual art, in the wake of their marginalisation within Modernist art and theory. The study is divided into three main sections. First, it demonstrates and questions the exclusion of the decorative within the central currents of modernism. Second, it examines the resurgence of the decorative in postmodern art and theory. This section is based on case studies of a number of postmodern artists whose work gained notice in the 1980s, and which evidences a sustained engagement with a decorative or ornamental aesthetic. The artists include Rosemarie Trockel, Lucas Samaras, Philip Taaffe, and several artists from the Pattern and Decoration Painting Movement of the 1970s. The final component of the study investigates the function and significance of the decorative in the work of a selection of Australian and international contemporary artists. The art of Louise Paramor, Simon Periton and Do-Ho Suh is examined in detail. In addition, the significance of the late work of Henri Matisse is analysed for its relevance to contemporary art practice that employs decorative procedures.

A couple of issues relating to risk and insurance that have not been examined to such an extent in previous studies are represented through the examination of two of the fastest growing areas within international insurance services, namely those of global bancassurance and life insurance markets. Firstly, this thesis establishes what determines the demand for bancassurance using a sample of 73 companies from 28 developed and developing countries from across the globe. Methodological improvements are made on previous studies through the use of the advanced estimation technique known as Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) which helps account for such inconsistencies as measurement errors, heteroscedasticity, multicollinearity and endogeneity. The results obtained both extend and reconcile existing literature in the field of bancassurance. Secondly, the determinants that influence the level of life insurance consumption throughout the OECD are scrutinized with a particular focus on the influence of systems of law. Thus far no other study has attempted to discover the relationship between life insurance consumption patterns and the legal systems in place within a given nation. The key finding highlights the importance of systems of law on consumption patterns, and specifies that there is a significant positive relationship between the French and German civil-law systems and the level of life insurance consumption within the OECD. In addition, the findings in regards to other demographic, macroeconomic and social determinants extend as well as support the existing literature in the field of life insurance.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Insurance</field><field name="subject">Insurance, Life</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scenario House</field><field name="creator">Wise, Gianni Ian, Media Arts, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Scenario House, a gallery based installation, is comprised of a room constructed as a ???family room??? within a domestic space, a television with a looped video work and a sound componant played through a 5.1 sound system. The paper is intended to give my work context in relation to the processes leading up to its completion.  This is achieved through clarification of the basis for the installation including previous socio-political discourses within my art practice. It then focuses on ways that the installation Scenario House is based on gun practice facilities such as the Valhalla Shooting Club. Further it gives an explanation of the actual production, in context with other art practices.  It was found that distinctions between ???war as a game??? and the actual event are being lost within ???simulation revenge scenarios??? where the borders distinguishing gaming violence, television violence and revenge scenarios are increasingly indefinable. War can then be viewed a spectacle where the actual event is lost in a simplified simulation. Scenario House as installation allows audience immersion through sound spatialisation and physical devices. Sound is achieved by design of a 5.1 system played through a domestic home theatre system. The physical design incorporates the dual aspect of a gun shooting club and a lounge room. Further a film loop is shown on the television monitor as part of the domestic space ??? it is non-narrative and semi-documentary in style. The film loop represents the mediation of the representation of fear where there is an exclusion of ???the other??? from the social body.  When considering this installation it is important to note that politics and art need not be considered as representing two separate and permanent realities. Conversely there is a need to distance politicised art production from any direct political campaign work in so far as the notion of a campaign constitutes a fixed and inflexible space for intellectual and cultural production. Finally this paper expresses the need to maintain a critical openness to media cultures that dominate political discourse. Art practices such as those of Martha Rosler, Haacke and Paul McCarthy are presented as effective strategies for this form of production.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Terrorism in art.</field><field name="subject">Fear in art.</field><field name="subject">Mass media and art.</field><field name="subject">Installations (Art)</field><field name="subject">Installations (Art) -- 21st century -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Art, Modern -- 20th century -- Political aspects.</field><field name="subject">Art, Modern -- 21st century -- Political aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of debt relief in low-income countries</field><field name="creator">Elnasri, Amani, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The perceived lack of conclusive quantitative evidence on the macroeconomic effects of debt relief in low-income countries has generally blurred the image of debt relief efforts and left the issues of its effectiveness and efficiency open to debate and dispute. This thesis seeks to shed more light on the subject by providing some further empirical evidence. This objective is achieved by performing an empirical investigation of two effects of debt relief. First, the study examines the debt relief-new borrowing relationship in a multivariable regression framework. The results that emerge suggest that, on average, debt relief can be beneficial in reducing the future new borrowing of Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs). This conclusion, to some extent, is in line with the goals of HIPCs debt relief initiatives in reducing external debt burdens of those countries to sustainable levels. However, it presents a challenge to the views of William Easterly on the ???perverse incentive effects??? of ???continuing waves??? of debt relief that are said to lead to further debt accumulation of a similar magnitude to replace old cancelled debt. Second, the analysis explores the influence of debt relief on domestic investment behaviour in developing countries. Debt relief is found to have a positive effect on domestic investment in countries with good policy environments. This result suggests that debt relief would be more effective in promoting domestic investment if it were more cautiously conditioned on sound policy frameworks.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Debt relief -- Developing countries.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26779</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microstructural development and thermal stability of aluminium-based composites processed by severe plastic deformation.</field><field name="creator">Mohseni, Hamidreza, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Equal channel angular pressing ECAP is a process whereby simple shear is applied to a billet during multiple passages through an angled channel of constant cross section. The process is capable of generating very large plastic strains that significantly refines the microstructure without altering the external dimensions of the billet. A number of properties are influenced by grain refinement with the generation of a submicron grain structure SMG by ECAP resulting in improved strength and hardness and enhanced superplasticity. In this thesis, both an AA7075 alloy and AA7075 Al-base metal matrix composite MMC reinforced with 5 wt. percent of 50 nm diameter SiC particles was produced by a powder metallurgy route followed by hot extrusion. The materials were subsequently deformed by ECAP at 350 C to a true effective strain of 4.6 in an attempt to refine the microstructure and further distribute the SiC reinforcement phase in the composite. The high temperature microstructural stability of both the as-deformed alloy and composite was investigated to elucidate the effect of the reinforcement phase on continuous and discontinuous grain coarsening. It was found that ECAP generated a fine equiaxed grain size of ~ 2.3 !m and ~1.8 !m in the alloy and composite, respectively. The composite was more refined after ECAP since the SiC particles allow the matrix to undergo more grain refinement during deformation. ECAP was found to be a reasonable method for further distributing SiC clusters in this composite which is important for optimizing the reinforcement phase in terms of ambient temperature strengthening and enhanced grain stability at elevated temperature. Both the alloy and composite were annealed at times up to 5h at 500 C to assess grain stability. During annealing, the grain structure of both materials evolved in a continuous manner unlike the discontinuous process of recrystallization. Such a process is similar to continuous recrystallization observed in a range of heavily deformed Al alloys. Substantial grain boundary interactions with MgZn2 precipitates and oxide particles were found in the alloy, with precipitate, oxide and SiC particles found in the composite. The strong pinning force exerted by these particles minimised grain growth in both materials with the composite exhibiting a finer less than 2.5 !m grain size than the alloy less than 3.5 !m after extended annealing. This enhanced grain stability was attributed to the high volume fraction SiC particles which resulted in a large value of the dispersion parameter f/d which results in significant boundary pinning during annealing. Grain stability was also analysed in terms of a recently-proposed mean field model of annealing where it was predicted that the composite should not undergo discontinuous coarsening, as observed experimentally.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Deformations (Mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Plasticity.</field><field name="subject">Aluminum alloys</field><field name="subject">Microstructure.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26793</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nonlinear in-plane behaviour of fixed arches under thermal loading</field><field name="creator">Liu, Xinpei, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the nonlinear in-plane behaviour of circular fixed arches subjected to thermal loading only. Due to the nonlinear prebuckling behaviour of arches and its effects, classical buckling theory which is founded on geometric prebuckling linearity can not predict the in-plane buckling of arches accurately. Based on a nonlinear formulation of the strain and displacement relationship and considering constant thermal distributions only, virtual work formulations are used to establish the differential equations of in-plane equilibrium and the statical boundary conditions, from which the nonlinear equilibrium equations are derived in closed form and which are suitable to use in design. By considering the adjacent buckled configurations, the differential buckling equilibrium equations are formulated from the principle of virtual work as well, and the analytical solutions for the nonlinear buckling of fixed arches are obtained. It is shown that nonlinear elastic buckling of a fixed in the plane of it curvature can not occur when it is subjected to thermal loading only, except if the arch is as a straight column. By using the algebraic representation of nonlinear in-plane equilibrium derived in this thesis, the elastic response of fixed arches at elevated temperatures and the attainment of first yield are examined in detail. The arch deflects transversely without bound in the elastic range at elevated temperatures, whereas it will yield first at the top extreme fibre of the cross section at the supports when a critical temperature is reached. The influence of several parameters such as the included angle is also considered. Based on the models of stress distributions at cross sections, the spread of yield both through the cross section and along the length of the arch is studied. It is indicated that the progress of yielding causes the first two hinges to form at the supports of the fixed arches, and then moment redistribution leads to the generation of the third hinge at the crown with an increase of temperature. Thus nonlinear plastic hinge analysis can be applied to the arch analysis under thermal loading.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fixed arches</field><field name="subject">nonlinear</field><field name="subject">in-plane behaviuor</field><field name="subject">elevated temperature</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular evolution of hepatitis C virus quasispecies.</field><field name="creator">Oon, Aileen, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The viral dynamics of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in newly acquired infection are not well understood. HCV exists within an individual as a spectrum of minor variants termed quasispecies. The evolution of minor variants may contribute to viral escape of the host?s immune response, thereby facilitating development of chronic infection. The hypervariable 1 region (HVR1) is the most heterogeneous part of the HCV genome and contains a putative B-cell epitope. Thus, diversity in HVR1 could be a strategy used to evade neutralising antibodies. Acutely infected individuals (n=24) were examined with the aim of defining HVR1 quasispecies diversity in acute infection. The characterisation of the E1/HVR1 sequence and host specific evolution of HCV minor variants in treatment nonresponders was also investigated.  HCV E1/HVR1 fragments were amplified from 48 sera using a combined reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Products were TA cloned into pCRIITOPO and approximately 10-20 clones were sequenced from each sample. HVR1 quasispecies diversity was examined longitudinally via sequence analysis. Quasispecies diversity was characterised primarily by mean nucleotide diversity. The mean HVR1 diversity of the acute cohort (n=48; 2.12% ?? 2.22) was lower than the diversity obtained for a cohort of chronically infected individuals (n=99; 4.5% ?? 5.1). There was no significant difference in mean HVR1 diversity between the HIV/HCV co-infected and HCV mono-infected groups (p=0.99) or between the clearer and non-clearer groups (p=0.85). Examination of amino acid usage and the hydropathic profile of each position in HVR1 revealed that sequence variation was confined to specific sites. The investigation of host specific evolution of HVR1 quasispecies demonstrated that minor variants (comprising 10- 20% of a population) became the dominant species over time in two treatment non-responders. These variants bore mutations that were not reflected in the consensus sequence of their respective populations at the initial timepoint analysed. Common infection was identified by 98% HVR1 sequence homology within two pairs of individuals. The evolution of common strains appeared to be different between individuals, suggesting host pressures may influence quasispecies evolution. This thesis provided an insight into the viral dynamics and host specific evolution of acute phase quasispecies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hepatitis C virus.</field><field name="subject">Host-virus relationships.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Origins and destinations: representation in the theatre of Romeo Castellucci</field><field name="creator">Lyandvert, Max, School of Theatre, Film &amp; Media, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis: Origins and Destinations: Representation in the theatre of Romeo Castellucci, investigates the working methodology of the Italian theatre director, Romeo Castellucci and his company, Societas Raffaello Sanzio. It provides an account of Societas Raffaello Sanzio???s history, working methods, a detailed reading of the thematic and philosophical landscape in their works especially Genesi: from the museum of sleep, and the cycle: Tragedia Endogonidia, and a discussion on the company???s artistic process towards the formation of its compositions and performances. This research and investigation is based on numerous viewings of most of the company???s theatre works created in the last six years, interviews with Romeo Castellucci as well as other participating artists, two privileged periods of observation (residencies) in Italy of the rehearsal and creation processes of three shows, and the analysis and discussion of some of the key critical and intellectual responses to the work of Romeo Castellucci. The thematic focus of the thesis is the notion of Origins and Destinations, and its relationship with the language of representation in Romeo Castellucci???s theatre. The theoretical discussion in the thesis is organised around Giorgio Agamben???s notion of Potentiality within the composition and content of Castellucci???s theatre. This concept provides a link between the key ideas of Origins, Destinations and Representation. Castellucci???s application of Agamben???s Potentiality deconstructs dramatic structure, narrative and action down to the fundamentals of the act itself, separated from its meaningful context. It is the conclusion of this thesis, that in the instant of this singular act, Romeo Castellucci manages to represent a point where origin and destination meet, or a point where they both are, for an instant, one and the same thing.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework for managing the evolving web service protocols in service-oriented architectures.</field><field name="creator">Ryu, Seung Hwan, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In Service-Oriented Architectures, everything is a service and services can interact with each other when needed. Web services (or simply services) are loosely coupled software components that are published, discovered, and invoked across the Web. As the use of Web services  grows, in order to correctly interact with the growing services, it is important to understand the business protocols that provide clients with the information on how to interact with services. In dynamic Web services environments, service providers need to constantly adapt their business protocols for reflecting the restrictions and requirements proposed by new applications, new business strategies, and new laws, or for fixing the problems found in the protocol definition. However, the effective management of such a protocol evolution raises critical problems: one of the most critical issues is to handle instances running under the old protocol when their protocol has been changed. Simple solutions, such as aborting them or allowing them to continue to run according to the old protocol, can be considered, but they are inapplicable for many reasons (e.g., the lose of work already done and the critical nature of work). We present a framework that supports service administrators in managing the business protocol evolution by providing several features, such as a set of change operators allowing modifications of protocols, a variety of protocol change impact analyses automatically determining which ongoing instances can be migrated to the new version of protocol, and data mining techniques inducing a model for classifying ongoing instances migrateable to the new protocol. To support the protocol evolution process, we have also developed database-backed GUI tools on top of our existing system. The proposed approach and tools can help service administrators in managing the evolution of ongoing instances when the business protocols of services with which they are interacting have changed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business protocol.</field><field name="subject">Web services.</field><field name="subject">Evolution.</field><field name="subject">Computer architecture.</field><field name="subject">Computer network architectures.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Particle and macromolecular fouling in submerged membrane</field><field name="creator">Negaresh, Ebrahim, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Particles and macromolecular components, including biopolymers (protein and carbohydrate), are viewed as the main foulants in the complex feed submerged membrane filtration systems such as membrane bioreactor (MBR). This work focused on two aspects of fouling in complex fluids: 1- Assessing fouling propensity and mechanisms for various model solutions. 2- Using of two specific solutions modelling biomass found in MBR for a better understanding of the fouling mechanisms in submerged MBR processes. Filtrations were carried out with 0.22 ??m PVDF hollow fibre membrane.  Alginate was used as a model for polysaccharide, bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model for protein, (un)washed yeast and bentonite were representing suspended solid contents. According to the data obtained during this study the fouling propensity of each model solution was classified as follow in a decreasing order: Alginate &amp;gt unwashed yeast &amp;gt washed yeast &amp;gt BSA &amp;gt bentonite for one-component solutions; and Alginate-washed yeast &amp;gt Alginate-BSA &amp;gt Alginate-bentonite &amp;gt Alginate-unwashed yeast for two-component solutions. Introducing the alginate increased the reversible fouling (except BSA). Passive adsorption had a significant effect on fouling of alginate even before the beginning of the filtration. Washed yeast and a mixture of washed yeast + BSA were then used as model solutions to simulate the activated sludge found in MBR. The concentration of washed yeast and BSA used in this study were calculated in order for the characterisations of the two model solution to match (in terms of biopolymer contents) those of MBR biomasses reported in the literature. By rinsing, backwashing and chemical cleaning of the membrane, three fouling layers of upper, intermediate and lower were defined respectively. Results obtained from the analysis of the biopolymers found in the cleaning solutions allow a better understanding of the fouling mechanisms occurring for the two model solutions used in this study: for washed yeast, the lower layer and for washed yeast + BSA , the upper and intermediate layers were found to have relatively high biopolymeric composition. This was explained by higher concentration of solids on the membrane surface and by higher biopolymer interactions when washed yeast was mixed with BSA.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Membrane bioreactor.</field><field name="subject">Fouling.</field><field name="subject">Membrane filters.</field><field name="subject">Particles.</field><field name="subject">Polysaccharide.</field><field name="subject">Bentonite.</field><field name="subject">Biopolymer.</field><field name="subject">Hollow fibre.</field><field name="subject">Characterisation.</field><field name="subject">Soluble microbial products.</field><field name="subject">Macromolecular.</field><field name="subject">Fouling organisms.</field><field name="subject">Carbohydrate.</field><field name="subject">Model solutions.</field><field name="subject">Extracellular polymeric.substances</field><field name="subject">Alginate.</field><field name="subject">Yeast.</field><field name="subject">Bovine serum albumin.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oxidative stress induced C-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) activation in tendon cells upregulates MMP1 mRNA and protein expression</field><field name="creator">Wang, Fang, St George Clinical school, UNSW</field><field name="description">To explore the potential mechanisms of tendon degeneration, we investigated the role of c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) activation and the regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) in tendon matrix degradation under oxidative stress.

Additionally, an attempt was made to predict the level of risk to persons working within those laboratories.  Based on the current NSW radiation control legislation and the relevant Australian Standards a comprehensive audit checklist was developed for this project.  Each safety requirement in those documents was used to develop a question, resulting in 187 questions in the checklist.  The questions were grouped into the following seven Topic Elements: Licensing and Registration; Radiation Safety Administration; Personal and Area Monitoring; Dose Limit Compliance; Documentation/Records; RSO/RSC Qualifications and Duties; and Facilities.  A novel feature was the allocation of "weighting factors" to individual questions and Elements.  The computer program facilitated analysis of data and provided output in spreadsheet and graphical form.  .The on-site physical audits were conducted using the project check-list, and were supplemented by discussions with the client's representative.  The results showed significant variation between sites with overall compliance scores ranging from 37% to 94%.  The reasons for this large variation stem from differences in local management regime; the appointment of an RSO at one site; variation in the extent of adoption of relevant codes of practice; and legislative weaknesses.  Further analysis of the data presented legal, advisory and combined scores for each Element for each site; and variations over time.  The graphic displays of the results were appreciated by client management.  The formula developed to predict risk, based on the physical parameters alone, showed little relationship to the total audit scores.  Statistical analysis of the two data groups by correlation coefficient confirmed this general finding.  Development of the formula however served to indicate deficiencies in the Question Set, and the importance of human factors in achieving a high degree of safety.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radiochemical laboratories -- Safety regulations -- New South Wales -- Evaluation.</field><field name="subject">Radiochemical laboratories -- New South Wales -- Safety measures -- Evaluation.</field><field name="subject">Radioisotopes -- Safety measures.</field><field name="subject">Radiation -- Safety measures.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40787</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Doulgas Summerland collection</field><field name="creator">Fitzpatrick, Peter Gerard, Media Arts, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Douglas Summerland Collection is a fictional "monographically based history"1.

The narrative for this body of work is drawn from a small album of maritime photographs discovered in 2004 within the archives of the Port Chalmers Regional Maritime Museum in New Zealand. The album contains vernacular images of life onboard several sailing ships from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, including the DH Sterling and the William Mitchell.  Through investigating the'truth' systems promoted by the photograph within the presentations of histories this research draws a link between the development of colonialism and the perception of photography. It also deliberates on how 'truth' perception is still a major part of an audience's knowledge base.  1.

In particular, it considers the role of place on Australian national and cultural identity. This is a timely exercise since 'Australianess' is increasingly cited as a factor in federal government policy development. In order to address such a broad and complex area, the agenda has been limited to three specific locations: the beach, the verandah and the backyard. These sites have been selected first because of their prominent iconic status within the notion of 'Australianess' and, second, because of the underlying functional parallels that unite them. The present thesis contends that, unlike the function-specific sites where identity is neutralised by globalised standards of appearance, behaviour and harsh fluorescent light, the beach, the verandah and the backyard are ambiguous zones of in between that provide escape, shelter as well as spiritual sanctuary. The figures engage with the nominated locations in accordance with the significance, the meanings that they ascribe to that particular site. These meanings, however, vary greatly from person to person and from demographic to demographic, hence, the grasp of a universally binding sense of identity becomes a slippery proposition. National and cultural seity - the way we are and the way we perceive ourselves as a unified collective - is conditional to a number of factors, the most enduring and pervasive of these is the sense of place, the landscape, the way we affect it and, reciprocally, the way it affects us. National and cultural identity is never static, but remains in a state of perpetual evolution. It must be continually re-assessed in order to remain abreast of the cultural palimpsest as successive waves and generations of people from a variety of backgrounds, situations, ideas and forms of expression inscribe notions of self into their immediate environment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Figure.</field><field name="subject">Beach</field><field name="subject">Verandah.</field><field name="subject">Backyard.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The enigma of appearances: photography of the third dimension</field><field name="creator">Fiveash, Tina Dale, Media Arts, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Enigma of Appearances is an examination into the medium of three-dimensional photography, with particular focus on the technique of stereoscopy. Invented in the mid-Victorian era, stereoscopy was an attempt to simulate natural three-dimensional perception via a combination of optics, neurology, and a pair of dissimilar images. Whilst successful in producing a powerful illusion of spatial depth and tangibility, the illusion produced by stereoscopy is anything but ??natural??, when compared to three-dimensional perception observed with the naked eye. Rather, stereoscopic photography creates a strange and unnatural interpretation of three-dimensional reality, devoid of atmosphere, movement and sound, where figures appear frozen in mid-motion, like waxwork models, or embalmed creatures in a museum. However, it is precisely stereoscopic photography??s unique and enigmatic interpretation of three-dimensional reality, which gives it its strength, separating it from being a mere ??realistic?? recording of the natural world.  This thesis examines the unique cultural position that stereoscopy has occupied since its invention in 1838, from its early role as a tool for the study of binocular vision, to its phenomenal popularity as a form of mass entertainment in the second half of the 19th century, to its emergence in contemporary fine art practice in the late 20th and 21stt centuries. Additionally, The Enigma of Appearances gives a detailed analysis of the theory of spatial depth perception; it discusses the dichotomy between naturalia versus artificialia in relation to stereoscopic vision; and finally, traces the development of experimental studio practice and research into stereoscopic photography, undertaken for this MFA between 2005 and 2007. The resulting work, Camera Mortuaria (Italian for ??Mortuary Room??), is a powerful and innovative series of anaglyptic portraits, based upon an experimental stereoscopic technique that enables the production of extreme close-up three-dimensional photography. Applying this technique to the reproduction of the human face in three-dimensional form, Camera Mortuaria presents a series of ??photo sculptures??, which hover between reality and illusion, pushing the boundaries of stills photography to the limit, and beyond.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stereoscopic photography.</field><field name="subject">3-d photography.</field><field name="subject">3d photography.</field><field name="subject">Three-dimensional photography.</field><field name="subject">Three-dimensional imaging.</field><field name="subject">Fiveash, Tina -- Themes, motives.</field><field name="subject">Stereoscopy.</field><field name="subject">Anaglyph.</field><field name="subject">Anaglyptic photography.</field><field name="subject">Stereography.</field><field name="subject">Photography, Stereoscopic -- History.</field><field name="subject">Portrait photography -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Australians -- Portraits.</field><field name="subject">Photography, Artistic -- Themes, motives.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forging diplomacy: a socio-cultural investigation of the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the "Art of Australia 1788-1941" exhibition</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Louise Frances, Art History &amp; Art Education, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The study is an historical investigation exploring the impact of the Carnegie Corporation's philanthropic cultural and educational activities in North America and Australia during the 1940s. The author examines the Carnegie's formation of public values and perceptions using cultural and aesthetic material in order to transmit American ideological ideals with the goal of influencing Australian, Canadian and USA cultural norms. The principal case examined in the paper is the "Art of Australia 1788-1941" exhibition, which toured the USA and Canada during 1941-42. Scrutiny of the exhibition uncovers the role it played in alliance building and the promotion of a range of cultural and political agendas. The investigation deploys a theoretical framework derived from the writings of Tony Bennett. The framework takes the form of a matrix that uses concepts of institutionalized agencies/power and individual agencies/knowledge detailed in a nine-cell matrix composed of propositional statements under the intersecting categories of culture, technologies, ethics, zones, objects, and visualization.  The "Art of Australia" Exhibition is a paradigmatic case of the instrumental, cultural application of exhibitions in the interest of the state, using government and non-government, public and private organizations as intermediaries. The analysis reveals the existence of diverse agendas and power/knowledge relationships between governments, corporations and the exhibition. This account highlights the museum as a significant arena for establishing and legitimating social norms and practices whilst steering cultural values. Such actions sponsored by government and entrepreneurial philanthropy are analyzed and interpreted as an early instance of building civic values and promoting the public belief in shared national identity. In this sense the investigation explores the educational mission of the museum and it's supporting agencies in the broadest public context.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Carnegie Corporation of New York.</field><field name="subject">Art of Australia 1788-1941 (Exhibition) 1941-1942.</field><field name="subject">Art -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Art and society.</field><field name="subject">Intercultural communication.</field><field name="subject">Art -- Study and teaching.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43085</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of urinary incontinence amongst Chinese women in Sydney</field><field name="creator">Hubbard, Mandy Queeneth, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction While urinary incontinence is a condition that affects men and women of all ages, it is more prevalent amongst post-menopausal women. Chinese women have been under-represented at the uro-gynaecology clinic at the Royal Hospital for Women for reasons yet unknown. Objectives What are the reasons for this under-representation? Do the Chinese women in Sydney not know of the services available for urinary incontinence, or, do they not want to seek help? What are their beliefs on urinary incontinence, and how do these beliefs affect their health seeking behaviour, if at all? Methodology Informal interviews with continence specialists and other healthcare professionals determined the selection of Qualitative research methodology, using Grounded Theory and Ethnography. Focus group discussion and interviews were the data collection techniques used for this research. Chinese women that had been in Australia for less than 5 years, more than 5 years and those born in Australia were recruited to participate. Results &amp; Conclusions The knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of Chinese women in Sydney differ depending on whether or not they were born in Australia, and the length of time in Australia. With Australian born Chinese being more acculturated, having greater knowledge of the services available for urinary incontinence and more likely to seek help for urinary incontinence compared to overseas born Chinese women. While those women who had been in Australia for more than 5 years were more informed about the available services, they did not necessarily use the available services.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Urinary incontinence -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Chinese -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Women.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The reform of the split share structure in China and its effects on the capital market: an empirical study</field><field name="creator">Lu, Fei, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the impact of the reform of the split share structure on the Chinese capital market. It adopts an event study methodology to examine the share price performance around the announcements of the reform and its predicted determinants, the type and level of consideration by using a sample of the top 300 companies listed in the combined Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) and Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE). I find the three-day cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) to be negative and significant around government announcement of the reform on 29 April 2005, but the three-day CAR around company???s announcement of the reform to be positive and significant. I attribute this change of sentiment by the market to the release of information about the reform process concerning features such as type and level of consideration. I also regress the company???s CAR on the type and level of consideration and find evidence to suggest that type of consideration matters, where investors prefer payment of shares from capital reserves or retained profits, cash, warrants or any combination of these methods as opposed to payment of shares from non-tradable shareholders. However, I observe no relation between level of consideration and CAR. I interpret this reaction to be that investors perceive that the consideration level is fair and reasonable based on the company???s financial and operating conditions.  These results imply that the reform of the split share structure exerts a positive impact on a company???s share price and the extent of impact is a function of the type of consideration.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reform</field><field name="subject">Split share sturcture</field><field name="subject">Chinese capital market</field><field name="subject">Consideration</field><field name="subject">Event study</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probabilistic skylines on uncertain data</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Bin, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Skyline analysis is important for multi-criteria decision making applications. The data in some of these applications are inherently uncertain due to various factors. Although a considerable amount of research has been dedicated separately to efficient skyline computation, as well as modeling uncertain data and answering some types of queries on uncertain data, how to conduct skyline analysis on uncertain data remains an open problem at large. In this thesis, we tackle the problem of skyline analysis on uncertain data. We propose a novel probabilistic skyline model where an uncertain object may take a probability to be in the skyline, and a p-skyline contains all the objects whose skyline probabilities are at least p.   Computing probabilistic skylines on large uncertain data sets is challenging. An uncertain object is conceptually described by a probability density function (PDF) in the continuous case, or in the discrete case a set of instances (points) such that each instance has a probability to appear. We develop two efficient algorithms, the bottom-up and top-down algorithms, of computing p-skyline of a set of uncertain objects in the discrete case. We also discuss that our techniques can be applied to the continuous case as well.  The bottom-up algorithm computes the skyline probabilities of some selected instances of uncertain objects, and uses those instances to prune other instances and uncertain objects effectively. The top-down algorithm recursively partitions the instances of uncertain objects into subsets, and prunes subsets and objects aggressively. Our experimental results on both the real NBA player data set and the benchmark synthetic data sets show that probabilistic skylines are interesting and useful, and our two algorithms are efficient on large data sets, and complementary to each other in performance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uncertainty (Information theory)</field><field name="subject">Skyline queries.</field><field name="subject">Database management.</field><field name="subject">Probabilities -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Probabilities -- Computer simulations.</field><field name="subject">Probabilities -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamental investigation of refractory reactions occurring at high temperatures in continuous steel casting process</field><field name="creator">Liu, Fuhai, Material Science &amp; Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">An in-depth study has been carried out to investigate refractory degradation during continuous steel casting processes. Slag/refractory interactions have been investigated through a study of the wetting behaviour and gas generation phenomena at the slag/refractory interface at 1550oC using sessile drop experiments. The influence of carbon content and slag composition was investigated. Two different steel casting slags (slag1: MnO 50%, SiO2 25%, Al2O3 25%; and slag2: MnO 40%, SiO2 60%) have been studied along with yttria stabilized zirconia refractory substrates respectively containing 10%, 15% and 20% carbon. The gas generation has been measured using the Infrared gas analyser, and its influence has also been investigated by taking optical images at varying times. The total amount of gases emitted has shown the dependence on the compositions of refractory substrates and the existence of casting slags. Under the investigation of zirconia-carbon refractory, a new phenomenon that the gas generated can push the liquid slags away and minimise the contact of slags and refractory substrates has been proven.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zirconia.</field><field name="subject">Graphite.</field><field name="subject">Aluminia.</field><field name="subject">Continuous casting.</field><field name="subject">Refractory materials.</field><field name="subject">Wettability.</field><field name="subject">Slag.</field><field name="subject">Gas generation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical investigation of SSDL</field><field name="creator">Fornasier, Patric, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The SOAP Service Description Language (SSDL) is a SOAP-centric language for describing Web Service contracts. SSDL focuses on message abstraction as the building block for creating service-oriented applications and provides an extensible range of protocol frameworks that can be used to describe and formally model Web Service interactions. SSDL's natural alignment with service-oriented design principles intuitively suggests that it encourages the creation of applications that adhere to this architectural paradigm. Given the lack of tools and empirical data for using SSDL as part of Web Services-based SOAs, we identified the need to investigate its practicability and usefulness through empirical work. To that end we have developed Soya, a programming model and runtime environment for creating and executing SSDL-based Web Services. On the one hand, Soya provides straightforward programming abstractions that foster message-oriented thinking. On the other hand, it leverages contemporary tooling (i.e. Windows Communication Foundation) with SSDL-related runtime functionality and semantics. In this thesis, we describe the design and architecture of Soya and show how it makes it possible to use SSDL as an alternative and powerful metadata language without imposing unrealistic burdens on application developers. In addition, we use Soya and SSDL in a case study which provides a set of initial empirical results with respect to SSDL's strengths and drawbacks. In summary, our work serves as a knowledge framework for better understanding message-oriented Web Service development and demonstrates SSDL's practicability in terms of implementation and usability.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Simple Object Access Protocol (Computer network protocol)</field><field name="subject">Web services.</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication -- Message processing.</field><field name="subject">Internet programming.</field><field name="subject">Computer network architectures.</field><field name="subject">Electronic data processing -- Distributed processing.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pitfalls of pit contacts: electroless metallization for c-Si solar cells</field><field name="creator">Fisher, Kate, School of Photovoltaic &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on improving the adhesion of electroless metal layers plated to pit contacts in interdigitated, backside buried contact (IBBC) solar cells. In an electrolessly plated, pit contact IBBC cell, the contact grooves are replaced with lines of pits which are interconnected by the plated metal. It is shown, however, that electroless metal layers, plated by the standard IBBC plating sequence, are not adherent on pit contact IBBC solar cells. The cause of this adhesion problem is investigated by examining the adhesive properties of each of the metal layers in the electroless metallization sequence on planar test structures. This investigation reveals that Pd activation of heavily P diffused Si impedes Ni silicide growth and that, in the absence of a silicide at the Ni/Si interface, an electrolessly plated Cu layer will cause the underlying Ni layer to peel away from the substrate. It is also found that the Ni silicidation process itself intermittently causes the unreacted Ni to spontaneously peel away from the substrate. An electroless metallization sequence that results in thick, adhesive Cu deposits on planar &amp;lt 100&amp;gt surfaces is developed in this thesis. It is shown that this process leads to the formation of a Ni silicide on both n- and p- type, heavily diffused surfaces. Fully plated, pit contact IBBC solar cells were not able to be fabricated during the course of this work but it is reasonable to expect that the modified plating sequence developed in this work will result in the metal layers being adhesive on these cells.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Silicon solar cells -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Silicon solar cells -- Materials.</field><field name="subject">Solar cells -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Solar cells -- Materials.</field><field name="subject">Photovoltaic power generation.</field><field name="subject">Metallizing.</field><field name="subject">Electroless plating.</field><field name="subject">Metallic films.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29568</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of interference on GPS timing receivers and their impacts on communications networks.</field><field name="creator">Khan, Faisal, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The rapid evolution of current and upcoming high speed and complex communications networks often necessitates flawless time synchronization among the network nodes in order to guarantee performance. GPS based synchronizers have long been used for synchronizing telecommunications equipment, currently providing an accuracy of up to 10ns. Such high accuracy demands excellent operation from GPS timing receivers. Interference is an important threat to GPS performance. Any degradation in performance, due to the introduction of interference, can cause these receivers to provide a low quality timing solution, or to lose lock with incoming GPS signals altogether. This consideration motivates the study of the performance of GPS timing receivers in the presence of harmful interference. This work is devoted to the theoretical and practical investigations of the effects of RF interference on GPS-based synchronizers and their impacts on communications networks. Contributions made during this work include: a) Identification of the processes and the parameters involved in producing a timing solution which are vulnerable to interference; b) experimentbased confirmation of a hypothesis about the effects of interference on GPS timing receivers; c) identification of the effects of degraded synchronization on the performance of communications networks, especially CDMA and GSM cellular networks, which rely upon GPS based synchronizers; and d) proposal of a method to predict and avoid communications network performance degradation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GPS timing receiver.</field><field name="subject">Cellular network.</field><field name="subject">Synchronization.</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Terra Alterius: land of another</field><field name="creator">Farmer, Margaret, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">What would Australia be like if it had been recognised as terra alterius, ???land of another???, by the British, rather than claimed and treated as terra nullius, ???land of no-one???? This question was posed by the exhibition Terra Alterius: Land of Another, which comprised works by Gordon Bennett, Barbara Campbell-Allen, Julie Dowling, Shaun Gladwell + Michael Schiavello, Jonathan Jones, Joanne Searle, Esme Timbery, Freddie Timms, Lynette Wallworth, Guan Wei and Lena Yarinkura, created or nominated in response to the theme. This thesis describes the concept of terra alterius and the exhibition Terra Alterius: Land of Another. It considers the utility of the concept terra alterius, whether the exhibition achieved its ambition to explore the political and social terrain of a reconciled Australia, and, briefly, whether the concept of terra alterius might be useful to other ???terra nullius??? countries. It argues that the curatorial strategies ??? the ???What if???? re-imagination of Australia???s past, multiplicity of vision and active creation, grounding of the exhibition in affect (in response to Aboriginal painting), and working within Indigenous protocols ??? were effective, and that the exhibition was a useful means of exploring the relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Comparisons with the exhibition Turn the Soil curated by Kevin Murray and the ???retrospective utopia??? W.H. Oliver argues has been created for New Zealand by the Waitangi Tribunal provide insight into the nature of the reconciled Australia presented in the exhibition and what might be achieved by a counterfactual exhibition. From these comparisons, it is argued, first, that the exhibition points to a disjuncture between Australia???s ongoing official, psychological and legal terra nullius and the approaches and relationships present in Australian society (characterised as a performance of Bloch???s utopian function); and secondly, that a counterfactual exhibition, because it is not bound to the factual, causal or narrative qualities traditionally attributed to history, is able to explore the future in a way that contains rather than denies the past. Although the concept of terra alterius is seen as having played a crucial role in the realisation of the exhibition, it is questioned whether the concept???s utility extends beyond Australia.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arts -- Australia -- Exhibitions.</field><field name="subject">Arts -- Australia -- History.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29574</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of recombinant proteins for selection, immobilization and expansion of stem cells</field><field name="creator">Xu, Yin, School of Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cellulose binding domains (CBDs) are found in cellulolytic microorganisms as discrete domains in free cellulases or as cellulosomes, which are extracellular multi-enzyme complexes. CBDs bind to cellulose and help the catalytic domains to access cellulose substrates. CBDs are used as affinity tags for immobilizing cells, proteins or molecules on cellulose matrices. They can also be used in protein engineering to alter protein expression and solubilities. Cohesins and dockerins are domains exclusive to cellulosomes. They interact with high affinity and the interactions are Ca2+-dependent. Chelation of Ca2+ causes irreversible conformational change to dockerins thus disrupting the interactions. The first aim of this project was to validate a putative CBD from endoglucanase EngD of C. cellulovorans, to test its effect on solubility as a fusion in chimeras. The second aim was to use chimeric proteins containing CBD, cohesin, dockerin and LG to establish a system for efficient cell immobilization, expansion and harvest in hollow cellulose fibres. A putative CBD from an enzyme with its natural linker (PTCBDengD), a CBD from a scaffoldin (CBDcbpA), three cohesin domains from different strains (Cip7, Coh6 and CipC1) and an antibody binding protein (LG) were used to construct various chimeric and fusion proteins. The two CBDs were fused to different cohesins and LG respectively and the chimeras? solubility was analyzed. The results showed that fusing with CBDcbpA did not significantly help to increase the solubility of the insoluble domain Coh6 and it even greatly reduced the solubility of the soluble domain CipC1. In contrast, PTCBDengD fusion increased the solubility of Coh6 by three fold and it did not alter the solubility of soluble protein/ domains. These results suggested that PTCBDengD may be a better domain to use as a fusion tag for expression and other biotechnology applications. Cellulose binding specificity of PTCBDengD and its chimeric proteins were tested and SDS-PAGE analysis results clearly demonstrated that PTCBDengD and its chimeras specifically bound to crystalline cellulose Avicel and non-crystalline cellulose Cuprophan. The results confirmed that PTCBDengD is a true CBD. Chimeric protein pairs CBDcbpA-Cip7/ LG-Doc and Cip7-PTCBDengD/ LG-Doc were used to build the scaffold on Cuprophan hollow cellulose fibre for reversible cell immobilization studies. Cell adhesion assay results showed that the double-chimera systems efficiently immobilize cells onto Cuprophan hollow fibre. Dissociation of LG-Doc from amorphous cellulose Cuprophan-bound CBDcbpA-Cip7 by EDTA treatment resulted in decrease of cell binding by almost 90%; however, re-association of LG-Doc after EDTA dissociation only achieved 50% efficiency of cell immobilization. Dot blot and SDS-PAGE analysis showed that dissociation/ re-association of LG-Doc to Cip7-PTCBDengD could be decreased in was interfered by the presence of cellulose. Preliminary results indicated that crystalline cellulose Avicel may improve dissociation/ re-association efficiency.  In conclusion, studies on recombinant proteins validated CBDengD's specific affinity to cellulose and its solubilizing effect on its fusion partner. Chimera pairs CBDcbpA-Cip7/ LG-Doc and Cip7-PTCBDengD/ LG-Doc are effective in cell immobilization. However, optimization is required to develop recyclable protein scaffolding and complexes on cellulosic matrices.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stem cells -- Research</field><field name="subject">Proteins -- Biotechnology.</field><field name="subject">Cellulose.</field><field name="subject">Cellulose -- Microbiology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Artist-God who ???disguides his voice???: a reading of Joseph Campbell???s interpretation of the dreamer of Finnegans Wake</field><field name="creator">Skuthorpe, Barret, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with engaging a critic who has been neglected by his peers in the field of Joyce studies for more than forty years. This critic, Joseph Campbell, is an American scholar more popularly known for his studies in myth. However, he began his intellectual career contributing to a subject that emerged in the early years of the critical reception of Finnegans Wake: that the dream depicted in Joyce???s final masterpiece is dependent on a Dreamer. The neglect Campbell???s work has endured is largely due, this thesis argues, to an inaccurate treatment of his reading of this dream figure. This inaccuracy largely stems from a critic, Clive Hart, who engages with the debate of the Dreamer as an introductory means to demonstrating the ???structural??? theories involved in the Wake. As a minor feature of Hart???s analysis, Campbell???s theory of the Dreamer is identified with another method, one belonging to a fellow American Joycean, Edmund Wilson, a method incongruent with Campbell theories of dream consciousness. Subsequently, Campbell remains an undeveloped scholar within Joyce criticism. To counter Hart???s inaccurate depiction of Campbell, this thesis argues that there is provision in early scholarship to re-evaluate Campbell???s theory of the Dreamer in more developed terms. In this respect, the thesis is divided up into three sections. The first section is a literary review of this early scholarship, demonstrating certain influential strains of thought equivalent to Campbell???s ???metaphoric??? concept of the Dreamer, one that contrasts with the rigid, ???literal??? ideas his work is predominantly identified. The second section examines Campbell???s account in detail and the specific criticism it drew from Hart. Finally, the third section argues that Campbell???s interpretation of the Dreamer is best engaged through an archetypal account of the Dreamer, one that regards the symbols encountered in the Wake through the ???guiding??? features of a mythological concept of the psyche sensitive to the reflexive tendencies of the dream portrayed, Campbell???s ???cosmogonic cycle???.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Campbell</field><field name="subject">Joseph -- Criticism and interpretation; Joyce</field><field name="subject">James -- Finnegans wake -- criticism and interpretation; dreams in literature; psychological fiction; history and criticism.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Petroleum well costs</field><field name="creator">Leamon, Gregory Robert, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This is the first academic study of well costs and drilling times for Australia???s petroleum producing basins, both onshore and offshore. I analyse a substantial database of well times and costs sourced from government databases, industry and over 400 recent well completion reports. Three well phases are studied - Pre-Spud, Drilling and Completion. Relationships between well cost factors are considered, including phase time, phase cost, daily cost, rig day rate, well depth, basin, rig type, water depth, well direction, well objective (e.g. exploration), and type of completion (P&amp;A or producer). Times and costs are analysed using scatter plots, frequency distributions, correlation and regression analyses. Drilling times are analysed for the period 1980 to 2004. Well time and variability in well time tend to increase exponentially with well depth. Technical Limits are defined for both onshore and offshore drilling times to indicate best performance. Well costs are analysed for the period 1996 to 2004. Well costs were relatively stable for this period. Long term increases in daily costs were offset to some extent by reductions in drilling times. Onshore regions studied include the Cooper/Eromanga, Surat/Bowen, Otway and Perth Basins. Offshore regions studied include the Carnarvon Basin shallow and deepwater, the Timor Sea and Victorian Basins. Correlations between regional well cost and well depth are usually high. Well costs are estimated based on well location, well depth, daily costs and type of completion. In 2003, the cost of exploration wells in Australia ranged from A$100,000 for shallow coal seam gas wells in the Surat/Bowen Basins to over A$50 million for the deepwater well Gnarlyknots-1 in the Great Australian Bight. Future well costs are expected to be substantially higher for some regions. This study proposes methods to index historical daily costs to future rig day rates as a means for estimating future well costs. Regional well cost models are particularly useful for the economic evaluation of CO2 storage sites which will require substantial numbers of petroleum-type wells.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oil well drilling -- Australia; Petroleum -- Prospecting -- Australia -- Costs -- Petroleum engineering -- Petroleum industry and trade.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30599</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being and doing ???Bengali-Muslims??? in Sydney: the construction of Halal and Haram.</field><field name="creator">Mahmood, Raasheed, School of Sociology &amp; Anthropology, UNSW</field><field name="description">This is a study against essentialist generalisations. Empirically, the study has been conducted to understand the food related practices among the Bengali-Muslim migrants in Sydney based on the dichotomy of Halal (permitted in Islam) and Haram (prohibited in Islam). Instead of evaluating Islam and Muslim communities as monolithic and undifferentiated this study reveals the localised actualisation of Islam which serves as a conditioning factor for these Bengali-Muslim migrants. Adopting a naturalistic methodological approach a number of ethnographic tools have been used to reveal the complex multifaceted processes through which Sydney???s Bengali-Muslim migrants negotiate the situational convergence and divergence between their ethnic identity as Bengali and their religious identity as Muslim. As a significant site of this interplay this study discovers from their food related practices that the Bengali-Muslim migrants in Sydney construct the notion of Halal-Haram food rules and regulations through the dialectics of their Bengali-informed Islam. The Bengali version of Islam poses considerable challenge to the modernist opposition between secularism and religion which is quite inadequate to understand the way the Bengali-Muslims historically negotiate both of these in the form of overlapping consensus. The findings of the study exhibit that this situationally shifting emphasis on their secular Bengali identity at one point of time and on their religious Muslim identity at another determines their decisive practices regarding food consumption in a Western cultural milieu. The Bengali-Muslim migrant participants of this study tend to perceive the notion of Halal-Haram in multiple ways so as to fit the pragmatic realities of their migrant life, which eventually leads them to reconstruct, renegotiate or even discard the scriptural/theological/authoritative discourse. Such underlying properties of food practices vindicate the argument that any stereotypically standardised notion of ???Islam??? is inadequate to understand varied Muslim migrant communities across the globe. Rather specific Muslim migrant community should be studied along with a profound understanding of their very contextual nature and historical formations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Private equity and venture capital instruments, a study into their use and intention.</field><field name="creator">Thomson, Dean, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Moral Hazard and the Agency Costs thereof have long been accepted arguments in venture finance theory and have therefore long been accepted shortcomings in the venture capitalist / entrepreneur relationship. In psychological experiments ??? including economic ??? it has been shown that human beings prefer to act in a reciprocal manner that reduces any inequity in a relationship. Humans who expect to receive an unfair and inequitable position in a relationship, will take steps to rectify that position. Specifically, if a venture capitalist expects the entrepreneur to unfairly extract private benefits from the investee company post investment by the venture capitalist, then he or she will impose costly controls and monitoring mechanisms in place to prevent that. All relationships that impose controls and monitoring mechanisms are inefficient, as opposed to Advising the investee which draws upon the skills of the venture capitalist and is generally efficient. The venture capital industry is comprised of intelligent and professional people who can recognise inefficiency easily. Indeed, this is how they make poorly managed companies into profitable trade sales or IPO???s.

Understanding the correlation between tensile properties and traditional soil parameters and soil suction is essential in identifying problems associated with desiccation induced cracking. A series of extensive laboratory experiments were performed on three different soils from existing embankment dams. This thesis concentrated on the investigation of tensile strength in relation to the type of soil, compaction water content, compaction density ratio, rate of loading, soil suction, moisture retention characteristics and the effect of drying and wetting. Stress-strain behaviour and tensile properties indicated a dependence on soil type and compaction criteria. The plasticity index, clay content and type of mineral has shown a significant influence on tensile strength. Compaction dry of optimum resulted in an increase in strength. Compaction wet of optimum showed a decrease in strength and small increase in strain at failure. Higher compaction effort resulted in higher tensile strength, tensile stiffness and brittle stress-strain behaviour. Difference in loading rate revealed response time for initial tensile deformation as well as sustainable duration up to failure point. The effect of soil suction plays an important role in drying during which specimens exhibited a considerable strength increase. The magnitude of strength increase may have been contributed by a combination of suction, air entry value and compaction density. The effect of wetting could cause decreasing in suction and thus a reduction in strength. Based on the findings, it was concluded that the desiccation-induced may not necessarily occur due to an associated increase in tensile strength. However, an increase in tensile strength is likely to be accompanied by an increase in shrinkage. Therefore, desiccation-induced cracking is related to the interaction between moisture loss, change in soil suction, tensile stress and shrinkage.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">strains and stresses</field><field name="subject">soil mechanics</field><field name="subject">soil moisture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling the process of satisfaction formation: towards a contingency perspective</field><field name="creator">Wang, Cheng, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Consumer satisfaction is a central topic in marketing. In the literature, a variety of conceptual models have been developed to capture the satisfaction formation process, with the dominant framework being the disconfirmation paradigm. However, despite its widespread acceptance and support, there is still a lack of clarity, especially regarding the role and relative importance of perceived performance in determining satisfaction. It has been suggested that satisfaction research has advanced into a stage where potential moderator variables need to be examined in order to explain previous mixed findings.  The current research proposes a contingency model of the satisfaction formation process, which posits that the nature of the relationships between satisfaction and its two key antecedents (i.e., perceived performance and disconfirmation) is contingent on one situational moderator (ambiguity) and two individual moderators (experience and involvement). Empirical testing of the model is in the form of a cross-sectional survey in China's mobile phone services industry using a convenience student sample obtained from one Chinese university. The results show that both disconfirmation and perceived performance have a direct impact on satisfaction under conditions of low experience or high involvement, whereas satisfaction is solely determined by perceived performance in situations of high experience or low involvement. In addition, the results also support a joint moderator influence of ambiguity and experience on the relationships between satisfaction and its antecedents, which is especially true in the case of high ambiguity and low experience.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Consumer satisfaction -- measurement.</field><field name="subject">Research -- Methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of critical size sheep cranial defect model for study of bone graft substitute</field><field name="creator">Ho, Ken Choong Khoon, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This is an original study to quantify and grade defect healing in a large animal cranial bone substitute model. The study of various therapies to heal cranial defects requires an appropriate ?critical? animal model. An experimental animal model should be analogous and recognizable as an appropriate challenge to human physiology. In addition, the defect must fail to heal unless treated with the tissue engineering therapy under study. Sheep as a large animal model was chosen because of its ability to tolerate creation of large skull defects analogous to clinical scenario, and its biology of healing as a high order mammal would be closer human beings. There is no agreement on the critical size limits for cranial defects. Various sizes have been termed "critical" in publications utilizing sheep. These ranged from 20-22mm. This study will investigate whether a 20mm defect is adequate.  Bilateral circular cranial defects of 10, 20 and 25mm diameters were created in 12 adult sheep. Based on guided tissue engineering principles, defect protection was utilized to prevent in-growth of fibroblasts and other connective tissue cells from the surroundings. As bone tissue regeneration strategies usually involve osteoconduction element, an animal model that considered the defect protection role of osteoconduction would be more appropriate. Repopulation and regeneration of the defect was maximized as an added challenge Bioresorbable polylactic acid co-polymer mesh (MacroPoreTM) and Titanium mesh (TiMeshTM) was used as defect protection.  The cranial defects were harvested at 8 and 16 weeks. The end-point analysis included Faxitron X-ray images, DEXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry), and histology. The defects were graded to assess their ability to eventually heal. 10mm defects fully healed at 16 weeks. There was new bone formation spanning the entire defect seen on histology. 25mm defects were spanned by thin fibrous tissue only. There was variability in the healing potential of 20mm defect. Based on presence of bone islands within the defect, half of the 20mm defects demonstrated ability to heal while the other half actually had new bone spanning the defects on histology. Critical size cranial defect in sheep for the study of bone graft substitute has to be larger than 25mm diameter. The model is then utilized to study the use of Pro Osteon and AGF compared with the gold standard of autologous bone graft.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cranial manipulation.</field><field name="subject">bones -- pathophysiology.</field><field name="subject">bone-grafting.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40499</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Employers' experiences of shortages of skilled process workers in Suzhou industrial park, China.</field><field name="creator">Li, Yiqiong, School of Organization &amp; Management, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines and explains multinational employers' experiences of localized shortages of skilled process workers in Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP), China.

Consequently, the measures and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used by the industry have invariably focused on outcomes rather than processes. Most of the outcome indicators have tended to give their feedback well after the event therefore failing to identify any weaknesses within the safety management processes. In order to overcome these limitations, two hospital construction projects in New South Wales were selected for an in-depth study and research analysis. The aim of the research was to understand the relationship between management process intervention and management process outcomes for safety in the construction industry. Initially a literature review identifying international practices in performance measurement for safety in construction was conducted so as to review existing safety management processes in partnership with the construction industry representatives.  A framework for measuring the performance of safety management processes and related outcomes was developed to stimulate improvement on both projects through the comparison of the performance of the safety management systems and outcomes.  This framework was then implemented and established to monitor the performance of the key safety management processes. The successful implementation of the performance measurement framework and the feedback to both stakeholders and subcontractors acted as a good communication tool in creating awareness among subcontractors.  It also helped to reduce repetitive hazards, resulting in improved safety outcomes. A statistical analysis found that relatively few injuries were explained by the identified safety hazards.  This highlighted the need to look for hazards that were specifically relate to injury occurrence.  The research findings identified a method for improving the existing hazard identification process.  It is anticipated that such improvements can help to better correlate hazard management processes with the project outcomes for safety in future projects.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SAFETY SYSTEMS</field><field name="subject">PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT</field><field name="subject">CONSTRUCTION</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the counterculture on Australian cinema in the mid to late 20th century.</field><field name="creator">Hooton, Fiona, Art History &amp; Art Education, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis discusses the impact of the counterculture on Australian cinema in the late 20thcentury through the work of the Sydney Underground Film group, Ubu. This group, active between 1965 -1970, was a significant part of an underground counter culture, to which many young Australians subscribed. As a group, Ubu was more than a rat bag assemblage of University students. It was an antipodean aspect of an ongoing artistic and political movement that began with the European avant-garde at the beginning of the 20th century and that radically transformed artistic conventions in theatre, painting, literature, photography and film.  Three purposes underpin this thesis: firstly to track the art historical links between a European avant-garde heritage and Ubu. Experimental film is a genre that is informed by cross art form interrelations between theatre, painting, literature, photography and film and the major modernist aesthetic philosophies of the last century. Ubu's revolutionary aesthetic approaches included political resistance and the involvement of audiences in the production of art. Their creative wellspring drew from: Alfred Jarry, Dadaism, Surrealism, Futurism, Fluxus, Conceptual and Pop art. This cross fertilization between the arts is critical to understanding not only the Australian experimental movement but the history of contemporary image making.  The second purpose is to fill a current void of research about early Australian Experimental film. This is a significant gap given it was a national movement with many international connections. The counterculture movement also contains many major figures in Australian art history. These individuals played their parts in the Sydney Push, Oz magazine and the activities of the Yellow House and have since become important multi arts practitioners and commentators.  Thirdly, the thesis attempts to evaluate Ubu's political and social agenda for the democratization of film appreciation through their objectives of: production, exhibition, distribution and debate of experimental film both nationally and internationally. Ultimately the group would succeed in these objectives and in winning the war on repressive censorship laws. Their influence has informed the practice of many of Australia's current film heavy weights.  Two key films have been selected for analysis, It Droppeth as the Gentle Rain (1963) and Newsfront (1978). The first looks forward to Ubu's contemporary practices and political agenda while the second demonstrates their longer term influences on mainstream cinema.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ubu Films -- History.</field><field name="subject">Experimental films -- New South Wales -- Sydney -- History and criticism.</field><field name="subject">Counterculture -- New South Wales -- Sydney -- History.</field><field name="subject">Motion pictures -- Australia -- History.</field><field name="subject">Motion picture industry -- Australia -- History.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soundfield analysis and synthesis: recording, reproduction and compression.</field><field name="creator">Wang, Shuai, School of Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunication, UNSW</field><field name="description">Globally, the ever increasing consumer interest in multichannel audio is a major factor driving the research intent in soundfield reconstruction and compression. The popularity of the well commercialized 5.1 surround sound system and its 6-Channel audio has been strongly supported by the advent of powerful storage medium, DVD, as well as the use of efficient telecommunication techniques. However, this popularity has also revealed potential problems in the development of soundfield systems. Firstly, currently available soundfield systems have rather poor compatibility with irregular speaker arrangements. Secondly, bandwidth requirement is dramatically increased for multichannel audio representation with good temporal and spatial fidelity. This master???s thesis addresses these two major issues in soundfield systems. It introduces a new approach to analyze and sysnthesize soundfield, and compares this approach with currently popular systems. To facilitate this comparison, the behavior of soundfield has been reviewed from both physical and psychoacoustic perspectives, along with an extensive study of past and present soundfield systems and multichannel audio compression algorithms. The 1th order High Spatial Resolution (HSR) soundfield recording and reproduction has been implemented in this project, and subjectively evaluated using a series of MUSHRA tests to finalize the comparison.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multichannel communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Sound -- Transmission.</field><field name="subject">Sound-waves.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the synthesis of poly(co-maleic anhydride/iso-butyl vinyl ether)with RAFT polymerisation.</field><field name="creator">Lea, Santa Cinzia, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Poly (co iso-butyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic anhydride), an alternating copolymer, was synthesised. For this class of copolymers the formation of an electron-donor complex is invoked to explain their microstructure in which the two comonomers strictly alternate. Due to its polarity, this copolymer constitutes a potential additive for imparting hydrophilic properties to a hydrophobic matrix. In order to obtain narrow molecular weight polymers and study the relation between the molecular weight of this additive and its ability to migrate to the host polymer surface, chain transfer agents were introduced in the system and also the Reversible Addition-Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT) process was employed. Free radical polymerisation was first carried out to allow for a comparison with the RAFT process and kinetics of copolymerisation was studied by NIR-FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy in order to analyse the rate of reaction of each comonomer. Dibenzyl trithiobenzoate, 3-benzyl sulfanyl thiocarbonyl sulfanyl-propionic acid and dibenzyl trithiobenzoate were used as RAFT agents. Results demonstrate that only benzyl dithiobenzoate is able to control the molecular weight of this copolymer and decrease its polydispersity index; possible reasons laying behind this result are discussed. It was also found that, in particular in the presence of benzyl dithiobenzoate, poly(iso-butyl vinyl ether) forms. This is an unusual phenomenon considering that the free radical polymerisation affords alternating copolymers and that iso-butyl vinyl ether is a monomer that polymerises through the cationic process. Experiments were carried out in various solvents in an attempt to counteract this side reaction, but no appreciable correlation between the properties of the solvents and the formation of homopolymer were found. Various hypothesis are considered, however it is likely that, in the conditions adopted, the presence of the RAFT agents alters the equilibrium constant of complex formation favouring the synthesis of the homopolymer. In addition to this side???reaction also inhibition of the copolymerisation reaction was at times encountered and an investigation into this phenomenon was also conducted.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RAFT</field><field name="subject">Poly (co iso-butyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic anhydride)</field><field name="subject">alternating copolymer.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology of catastrophic rugby football injuries in New South Wales.</field><field name="creator">Rotem, Tai, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Aims and objectives: To investigate the epidemiology, risk factors, and preventive strategies for serious head and spinal injuries related to rugby league and union football in New South Wales (NSW).  Methods: The three main components of this study included. 1. A retrospective analysis of clinical and compensation case file records during the 16-year period, 1984-1999. 2. A review of game rules, weights and heights of players, over the past 100 years. 3. A review of film and video footage of rugby football games spanning most of the 20th century. A method was developed to allow valid comparisons in style of play over a 70-year period.  Results: The estimated annual incidence rate of SCI for rugby league players was 1.9 (95%CI 1.3 - 2.8) per 100,000 estimated players per year, and 3.3 (95%CI 2.2 - 4.8) per 100,000 estimated rugby union players per year over the study period 1984 to 1999. There was no significant change in the incidence of rugby league related serious spinal cord injuries (1984-1999), fatalities (1984-1999) or serious head injuries (1984-1999). There was a small but significant decline in rugby union related serious spinal cord injuries (1984-1999, P&lt;0.05). However, the relative risk of spinal cord injury was 1.34 times greater for rugby union compared to rugby league over the entire study period (95%CI 1.01 - 1.67, P&lt;0.05). For rugby football, the evidence suggested that the force of impact between participants was a key causal risk factor for serious injury. Elite rugby league and union players from 1999-2000 teams were significantly heavier (P&lt;0.05) and taller (P&lt;0.05) than players pre 1950. Players in modern elite games post 1989 were more likely to be tackled by multiple opponents (P = 0.000), tackled head on (P&lt;0.05), at chest level (P&lt;0.05) and at greater speeds than their earlier counterparts pre 1958. However, modern players appear to be no more aggressive or perpetrate greater foul play than their predecessors.  Conclusions: There was a continued annual occurrence of catastrophically serious injuries leading to permanent brain damage and quadriplegia associated with rugby league and union in NSW. The critical risk factors found to be associated with serious injury in rugby football suggest relatively novel approaches to the development of preventive strategies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rugby football -- New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Rugby football injuries -- New South Wales.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44282</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of single-part adhesives as healing agent in self-healing composites.</field><field name="creator">Wang, Xufeng, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to develop a new single-part healing system for self-healing composites. The self-healing approach to composite repair has been developed in the last two decades and means that a damaged area can be repaired by material already housed within the structure. The background and development of self-healing has been reviewed. The two main self-healing mechanisms are discussed. To date only two part self healing systems have been examined. These require diffusion of the separate constituents to a single location in order to effect cure and restore strength. Single part adhesives do not have this disadvantage and are therefore very attractive. Several candidate single-part adhesive or resin systems were considered and discussed according to the critical requirements of a self-healing system. A series of experiments was undertaken to evaluate the possibility of candidate adhesive systems being effective for self-healing by focusing on the determination of storage stability and bonding efficiency. The results of storage stability testing showed that the stability of cyanoacrylate and polyurethane adhesives was poor. However silane and polystyrene cements showed good storage stability. Very low bonding efficiency was achieved with polystyrene cement but a 22% strength recovery was obtained with the silane 3-[tris(trimethylsiloxy)silyl]-propylamine.

In December 2002, the Howard government enacted the Taxation Laws Amendment (Venture Capital) Act 2002 (Cth) and the Venture Capital Act 2002 (Cth). This legislative package created a prospective concession primarily aimed at qualifying limited partnerships who participate in the Australian venture capital market. Subject to a rather stringent qualification criteria, such partnerships are treated as fiscally transparent for the purposes of Australian taxation law. In addition, the gains made upon the disposal of portfolio investments by these partnerships may not be subject to Australian capital gains tax (&amp;quotCGT&amp;quot) or otherwise assessable as ordinary income. The central concept of these measures is the venture capital limited partnership (&amp;quotVCLP&amp;quot), and other fund of fund organisational forms which are founded on the limited partnership. For this reason, the provisions of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Venture Capital) Act 2002 (Cth) and the Venture Capital Act 2002 (Cth) are collectively identified as the &amp;quotVCLP Concessions&amp;quot. This thesis has been prepared as a rigorous assessment of the VCLP Concessions. It draws upon an analysis of the nature and structure of venture capital investing to determine whether the particular features of the VCLP Concessions appropriately cater for the needs of prospective foreign investors. The efficacy and appropriateness of the VCLP Concessions from a policy perspective is also examined. Recommendations are provided which, if enacted, would address regions of structural inconsistency and improve the functioning of this concessional regime.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The empty space.</field><field name="creator">Mataraga, Francesca, School of Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Empty Space project aims to explore the interior and exterior space of an object through the use of Perspex. The solidity of the concrete or minimalist art object and the space that it physically occupies will be challenged by the use of visually ambiguous material. Physically solid yet visually transparent or reflective, perspex challenges our perception of solidity - what is internal and what is external. It is by nature a subversive and ambiguous material. The visual transparency of the material contradicts the physical presence of the object it creates. It creates a play between presence and absence. It is this spatial contradiction that this project exploits in order to create physical and visual tension. The solid physicality of the objects will directly draw on the tradition of concrete art and the language of minimalism. The visual transparency of the material will however, subvert this language both conceptually and literally. This will make the relationship between internal and external space more complex, challenging the physicality of the art object and questioning the nature of solidity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Space (Art)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speech and music discrimination using short-time features</field><field name="creator">Mubarak, Omer Mohsin, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the problem of classifying an audio stream as either speech or music, an issue which is beginning to receive increasing attention due to its wide range of applications. Various techniques have been presented in last decade to discriminate between speech and music. However, their accuracy is still not sufficient since music can refer to a very broad class of signals due to the large number of musical instruments found in audio data. Performance can also be further compromised in noisy conditions, which are unavoidable in some practical situations. This thesis presents an analysis of feature extraction techniques and classifiers currently being used, followed by the proposal and evaluation of new features for improved classification. These include two novel cepstral features, delta cepstral energy and power spectrum deviation, along with amplitude and frequency modulation features. The modified group delay feature, initially proposed for speech recognition, is also investigated for speech and music discrimination. Experiments were performed using different sets of features, compared among themselves and with conventional MFCCs using error rate criteria and Detection Error Trade-off curves. It is shown that the proposed cepstral and modulation features result in an increase in the accuracy of the conventional MFCC based system. However, the modified group delay feature which has been shown to improve accuracy for speech classification problems, does not contribute much to the problem of speech and music discrimination. Among the ones presented here the optimum feature configuration, both modulation features with MFCC, resulted in overall error rate of 6.57% as compared to 7.43% for MFCC alone.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MFCC</field><field name="subject">short-time features</field><field name="subject">classification</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Painting narrative: the form and place of narrative within astatic medium</field><field name="creator">Edney, Katherine, School of Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Within painting, there are numerous possibilities for the ways in which a narrative can be compositionally presented in order to communicate a particular emotion or story. Traditional devices including gesture, facial expression, interaction of figures and symbolism establish foundations within the composition to facilitate a narrative response and formulate questions as to the how, what and why. This formal language may also be considered in addition to other concepts surrounding the term narrative itself. The notion of narrative as something which is fluid also encompasses issues of time, movement, and continuity; idea??s which seemingly contradict the static temperament of painting. How painters have been able to successfully construct elements of narrative in their work, while also capturing a sense of movement or a passage of time is the starting point at which the following research takes shape. When embarking on this project, I realised that there was no definitive text on this subject which specifically analysed the form and composition of pictorial narratives as sole entities. Theoretical discussions surrounding a painting??s formal arrangement have mostly been produced in relation to how they either illustrated or have been adapted from a written source. This paper is intended to examine the structure of narrative paintings from a stand alone visual perspective, and not how they are comparative to a literary source. Over the course of this investigation, I subsequently found that the methodologies of continuous narrative paintings from the Renaissance echoed certain theoretical concerns within contemporary cinematic narratives. While painting and film maintain a relationship to some degree because they are both visual media, (in reference to colour, tone and symbolism), the most interesting parallel is the depiction of time. This correlation between painting and film, where elements of the narrative are compositionally presented in a non-linear way, has had the most important influence over the production of my work for the exhibition, ??Hidden Fractures; A Narrative in Time??. Certain structures within film, such as event ??order?? and sequencing resonate correspondingly to the stylistic approach sustained within recent work. This ??jig-saw?? method, presents individual paintings (or canvases) akin to pieces of a story which  have been sliced up, and placed back together out of their ??chronological?? order. These chosen snippets may represent a scene or emotion, and uphold their own position or viewpoint in relation to another image or painting. These unmatched sequences of images, similar to the unmatched sequences in film, can disrupt the perception and flow of space, and sense of narrative order. When sequences are viewed out of order, the perception of events within the narrative change. The viewer strives to construct the meaning of the work dependent upon each image??s relationship to another, in turn forming the underlying narrative. Through such ??story comprehension??, the viewer endeavours to create ??logical connections among data in order to match general categories of schema??.

The project approaches the question in three parts: 1.	A review of literature exploring the circumstances in which and for what reasons sexually explicit HIV/AIDS campaigns are produced. 2.	An analysis of seven interviews with producers of HIV prevention campaigns exploring how, why, where and for what reasons explicit campaigns are produced. 3.	An analysis of eight interviews with homosexually active Sydney men exploring how HIV prevention campaigns are viewed, consumed and understood.  The interviews were in-depth, semi-structured and conducted over one hour per interviewee.  The findings are dominated by two interrelated and at times conflicting themes. First, that there is a strongly held belief by campaign producers that the most effective HIV prevention campaigns targeting gay men are produced by the community and reflect that community and as a result must at times be sexually explicit. Second, that it is no longer sufficient for HIV prevention campaigns to rely on explicit sex to attract attention. In an environment where visual images, and sexually explicit visual images especially, are becoming more accessible, and media and communication is more prevalent and complex, safe sex campaigns are forced to deliver ever more sophisticated and stimulating creative materials in order to maintain the engagement of gay men. The interviews revealed that both campaign producers and consumers participated in the production of a visual literacy of safe sex campaigns.  This literacy was necessary to both effectively produce and comprehend the campaigns. The interviews showed that while HIV prevention campaigns that use sexually explicit language and imagery can be highly effective at engaging gay men, the success of sexually explicit campaigns is contextual that is, dependent on where, to whom and in what circumstances the materials are delivered. The audience??s accumulation of knowledge and cultural experience when viewing the campaigns, in other words their safe sex campaign literacy, significantly influenced their capacity to understand, appreciate and be engaged with sexually explicit HIV prevention campaigns.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS</field><field name="subject">Social marketing</field><field name="subject">Campaign</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Gay men</field><field name="subject">HIV infections -- Australia -- Prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CircularTrip and ArcTrip:effective grid access methods for continuous spatial queries.</field><field name="creator">Cheema, Muhammad Aamir, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A k nearest neighbor query q retrieves k objects that lie closest to the query point q among a given set of objects P. With the availability of inexpensive location aware mobile devices, the continuous monitoring of such queries has gained lot of attention and many methods have been proposed for continuously monitoring the kNNs in highly dynamic environment. Multiple continuous queries require real-time results and both the objects and queries issue frequent location updates. Most popular spatial index, R-tree, is not suitable for continuous monitoring of these queries due to its inefficiency in handling frequent updates. Recently, the interest of database community has been shifting towards using grid-based index for continuous queries due to its simplicity and efficient update handling. For kNN queries, the order in which cells of the grid are accessed is very important. In this research, we present two efficient and effective grid access methods, CircularTrip and ArcTrip, that ensure that the number of cells visited for any continuous kNN query is minimum. Our extensive experimental study demonstrates that CircularTrip-based continuous kNN algorithm outperforms existing approaches in terms of both efficiency and space requirement. Moreover, we show that CircularTrip and ArcTrip can be used for many other variants of nearest neighbor queries like constrained nearest neighbor queries, farthest neighbor queries and (k + m)-NN queries. All the algorithms presented for these queries preserve the properties that they visit minimum number of cells for each query and the space requirement is low. Our proposed techniques are flexible and efficient and can be used to answer any query that is hybrid of above mentioned queries. For example, our algorithms can easily be used to efficiently monitor a (k + m) farthest neighbor query in a constrained region with the flexibility that the spatial conditions that constrain the region can be changed by the user at any time.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nearest neighbor analysis (Statistics)</field><field name="subject">Querying (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Query languages (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Data structures (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Real-time data processing.</field><field name="subject">Geographic information systems -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Computational grids (Computer systems)</field><field name="subject">Computer algorithms.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Second skin: exploring perceptions of contemporaryknitting.</field><field name="creator">Clifton-Cunningham, Alana, Design Studies, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Using written and studio research, the above research question is interrogated through a body of practical work, that evolved into a static exhibition titled Second skin: new knitting at The Ivan Dougherty Gallery, Paddington, New South Wales, Australia, in January/February 2008. This thesis examines knitting as a form of constructed textile in an historical and contemporary context and explores the integral relationship it has with fashion and textiles, as well as questioning the significance of interplay between fashion and art. The primary aim of this research is to explore contemporary knitwear designers working in the high-fashion&#146; area of design and investigate how they are challenging traditionally established rules and perceptions, and potentially blur the boundaries of what is considered fashion design, into art. While conceptual fashion design has always been a debateable issue among fashion scholars as to whether it can be viewed as fashion, antifashion or possibly art, this thesis examines the influences of modernity and deconstruction in relation to knitting, to establish a conclusion regarding the contemporary position and understanding of knitting in society at present. Through gathering both primary and secondary research nationally and internationally, knitting has been examined in relation to the ways in which contemporary designers working in the realm of knitting are unravelling these traditionally based preconceptions, and analysing what they are accomplishing through the use of mixed media applications, post-knitting treatments, yarn and stitch manipulation, and challenging sculptural form to create a new visual language through artisanal production. The body of work presented explores the concepts established in the written research relative to perception and deconstruction, and provokes questions which challenge the notion of knitting as fashion, art or both. Through hand and machine knitting techniques, Second skin: new knitting examines body scarification in the form of tribal markings, which allows each pieces to transform into a second skin that convey interpretive narratives and visual messages. The predominant medium utilised is 100% Australian wool and in conjunction, incorporates mixed media materials such as silk organza and semi precious stones, and technological processes include laser cutting and etching of Tasmanian oak veneer and leather.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Firm Size Effect: An Application of Hierarchy Theories</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Hugh David, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis the positive relationship between firm size and wages is investigated through the application of hierarchy theories. Many different explanations have been proposed for this relationship, but have met only limited success at best. The strongest finding to date is that unobserved ability is a significant factor.  The question of interest here is ???why do wages increase as the size firm increases????  Hierarchy theories take a different approach towards the analysis of firms in comparison to the alternate theories which have dominated previous investigations. As a result of their focus on the organisational relationships within a firm???s internal structure, hierarchy theories offer certain insights to the size-wage relationship which to date have been unnoticed. An empirical investigation into the size-wage differential incorporating structural considerations into an augmented wage equation offers strong support for the propositions of hierarchy theories. I find that half of the firm size effect for workers can be explained by controlling for some aspects of management structure, and that span of control has a discontinuous effect on wages. These results are completely consistent with the existing findings on unobserved ability and have the added attraction of providing economic as well as statistical explanatory power.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Firm Size</field><field name="subject">Firm Size effect</field><field name="subject">Hierarchy Theory</field><field name="subject">Wages</field><field name="subject">Unobserved ability</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Families with Period 1 of 2-groups of Coclass 3</field><field name="creator">Smith, Duncan Alexander, Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">The 2-groups of coclass 1 are widely known and James (in 1975) looked at the 2-groups of coclass 2.

It lies in the midst of a Nothofagus moorei cool temperate rainforest, which is at its southern limits here. The swamp is close to the boundaries between temperate rainforest, subtropical rainforest, sclerophyll forest and sub-alpine formations and may be a sensitive recorder of past changes in the vegetation. The palynology and the sediments have been studied to a depth of 6.5 metres and were dated with eleven 14C dates. The base of the sediment is about 40,000 years old. The results showed the following: From 40,000-30,000 years BP, Burraga was a lake with a very slow rate of deposition of fine grained sediments and flourishing aquatic/swamp vegetation. The dryland vegetation was an open or sparsely treed grassland/herbfield. From 30,000-21,000 years BP, the dryland vegetation remained much the same, but the aquatic vegetation disappeared. From 21,000-17,000 years BP, sandy sediments were deposited at an accelerated rate in a relatively shallow lake, culminating in a layer of gravelly sand.  The vegetation was a treeless grassland between about 21,000 and 15,000 years BP. After 17,000 years BP, the rate of sediment accumulation slowed and after 15,000 years, some mesic elements appeared. Dicksonia antarctica became prominent between about 13,000 and 12,000 years BP and Nothofagus was consistently present after about 11,500 years BP. Peat deposition started about 6,500 years BP. By 6,000 years BP the cool temperate rainforest was fully developed, remaining on the site until the present.  These changes suggest that the climate at 40,000 years BP was drier than the present, becoming drier and reaching maximum aridity about 17,000 years BP, when  temperatures were also at their lowest. Subsequently, the temperature increased and around 15,000 years BP the climate became wetter. Maximum moistures and temperatures were reached between about 9,000 and 5,000 years BP. The climate then varied until it reached the present.

Unfortunately, each one of these systems is specific to a local service, with little or no interconnection with services in other locales. This makes it virtually impossible to perform dynamic and interactive GIS operations across multiple locales which have similar or dissimilar system configurations. The Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) resolved the problems partially by offering excellent conceptual and logical abstraction model for data exchange. Recent advancements of the Internet enlightened the GIS community as to the realization of an ideal concept of information interchange. A suite of new technologies that embraces Extensible Markup Language (XML), Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), Portable Network Graphics (PNG) and Java creates a powerful and new perspective that can be applied to all phases of online GIS system development. The online GIS is a Web-based approach to integrating diverse spatial data sources for GIS applications.  To address the spatial data integration options and implications related to the Web-based approach the investigation was undertaken in 5 phases: (1) Determine the mapping requirements of graphic and non-graphic spatial data for online GIS application; (2) Analyze the requirements of spatial data integration for online environments; (3) Investigate a suitable method for integrating different formats of spatial data; (4) Study the feasibility and applicability of setting up the online GIS; and (5) Develop a prototype for online sharing of teaching resources.  Resulting from the critical review on current Internet technology, a conceptual framework for spatial data integration was proposed. This framework was based on the emerging Internet technology on XML, SVG, PNG, and Java. It was comprised of four loosely coupled modules, namely, Application Interface, Presentation, Integrator, and Data module. This loosely coupled framework provides an environment that will be independent of the underlying GIS data structure and makes it easy to change or update the system as a new task or knowledge is acquired.  A feasibility study was conducted to test the applicability for the proposed conceptual framework. A detailed user requirements and system specification was thus devised from the feasibility study. These user requirements and system specification provided some guidelines for online GIS application development. They were expressed specifically in terms of six aspects: (1) User; (2) Teaching resources management; (3) Data; (4) Cartography; (5) Functions; and (6) Software development configuration.  A prototype system based on some of the devised system specifications was developed. In the prototype software design, the architecture of a Three-Tier Client-Server computing model was adopted. Due to the inadequacy of native support for SVG and PNG in all currently available Web browsers, the prototype was thus implemented in HTML, Java and vendor specific vector format. The prototype demonstrated how teaching resources from a variety of sources and format (including map data and non-map resources) were integrated and shared. The implementation of the prototype revealed that the Web is still an ideal medium for providing wider accessibility of geographical information to a larger number of users through a corporate intranet or the Internet cost-effectively.  The investigation concluded that current WWW technology is limited in its capability for spatial data integration and delivering online functionality. However, developing of XML-based GIS data model and graphic standards   SVG and PNG   for structuring and transferring spatial data on the Internet appear to be providing solutions to the current limitations. It is believed that the ideal world where everyone retrieving spatial information contextually through a Web browser disregarding the information format and location will eventually become true.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">data integration</field><field name="subject">Web mapping</field><field name="subject">online GIS</field><field name="subject">Internet mapping</field><field name="subject">geographic information systems</field><field name="subject">information storage and retrieval systems</field><field name="subject">cartography</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The congruent garden: an investigation into the role of the domestic garden in satisfying fundamental human needs</field><field name="creator">Steven, Michael Lawrence, School of L&amp;scape Architecture, UNSW</field><field name="description">An interest in the application of the concept of sustainability to the design of the domestic garden lead to the realisation that the social dimensions of sustainable design, that is, the capacity of the garden to meet human needs, was poorly understood. In the interests of achieving an holistic understanding of the hole of the domestic garden in meeting human needs, fourteen gardeners from rural north-west Hawkesbury were interviewed on the role that gardens and gardening plays in their everyday lives.  Using Max-Neef's theory of needs and satisfiers as a reference and applying the principles of qualitative data analysis, the interview transcripts were analysed to identify evidence for the satisfaction of fundamental human needs in the lives of the participants, their partners and families. It was established that gardens and gardening have the potential to satisfy human needs within all nine of Max-Neef's axiological categories of need (Subsistence, Protection, Affection, Understanding, Participation, Leisure, Creation, Identity, Freedom) and across all fours existential states (Being, Having, Doing and Interacting).  To present the data in terms which might usefully inform the practice of garden design, key satisfiers identified from the data were conceptualised into themes, which in turn became the basis for five conceptual models (Dwelling, Nurture, Pleasure, Enlightenment and "Being" Fully Human) which serve to define the broad domains within which needs might be satisfied within the garden. Collectively, these five conceptual models constitute the Congruent Garden. A series of garden prototypes relating to the themes of each conceptual model are proposed as the basis for the delivery of garden-related satisfiers. Some suggestions are made on the matter of further research work arising from this initial study.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gardens</field><field name="subject">Landscape gardening</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Error resilience in JPEG2000</field><field name="creator">Natu, Ambarish Shrikrishna, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The rapid growth of wireless communication and widespread access to information has resulted in a strong demand for robust transmission of compressed images over wireless channels. The challenge of robust transmission is to protect the compressed image data against loss, in such a way as to maximize the received image quality. This thesis addresses this problem and provides an investigation of a forward error correction (FEC) technique that has been evaluated in the context of the emerging JPEG2000 standard.  Not much effort has been made in the JPEG2000 project regarding error resilience.  The only techniques standardized are based on insertion of marker codes in the code-stream, which may be used to restore high-level synchronization between the decoder and the code-stream. This helps to localize error and prevent it from propagating through the entire code-stream. Once synchronization is achieved, additional tools aim to exploit as much of the remaining data as possible. Although these techniques help, they cannot recover lost data. FEC adds redundancy into the bit-stream, in exchange for increased robustness to errors. We investigate unequal protection schemes for JPEG2000 by applying different levels of protection to different quality layers in the code-stream. More particularly, the results reported in this thesis provide guidance concerning the selection of JPEG2000 coding parameters and appropriate combinations of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes for typical wireless bit error rates. We find that unequal protection schemes together with the use of resynchronization makers and some additional tools can significantly improve the image quality in deteriorating channel conditions. The proposed channel coding scheme is easily incorporated into the existing JPEG2000 code-stream structure and experimental results clearly demonstrate the viability of our approach</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">JPEG2000</field><field name="subject">Error Protection</field><field name="subject">image processing</field><field name="subject">digital techniques</field><field name="subject">image compression</field><field name="subject">data compression</field><field name="subject">telecommunications</field><field name="subject">image coding standard</field><field name="subject">JPEG</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wake survey behind a rotating ventilator</field><field name="creator">Rashid, Dewan Md. Harunur, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">With environmental concern growing in both affluent and developing countries, roof top ventilators, a form of natural ventilation requiring only wind energy to ensure quality air circulation and comfort is becoming a considered choice of many households and industries. Unfortunately, however, many of these ventilators have evolved through trial and error and the flow physics associated with these ventilators is barely understood. The present experimental project was, therefore, undertaken as part of UNSW- Industry collaboration program funded under an Australian Research Council Grant to explore whether the aerodynamics forces acting on these ventilators during their operation could be obtained. A commercial roof top ventilator supplied by industry was, therefore, tested in an open jet wind tunnel of the University of New South Wales and the results are presented in this thesis.   A novel feature of this project is the examination of the suitability of ???the three dimensional wake traverse??? technique to the wake of rotating ventilator. This technique has so far been applied with limited success to the wake of lifting bodies of fixed wing configuration only. In the absence of adequate data in the literature on rotating ventilator, the aerodynamics force components obtained by this technique have been compared against force balance measurements. The results show that the wake traverse technique is capable of determining lift and total drag forces associated with the ventilator flow during its operation from the pressure and velocity information gathered downstream of a ventilator in its wake. Generally, from these data, the technique also allows isolation of the profile and induced components of the drag force. However, from the induced drag value, while it is possible to determine the lift force, it is however, found that a more accurate value of lift force can be evaluated using axial vorticity formulation.   The availability of the above technique which does not require measurements on the test specimen itself, will aid in providing a cost efficient investigation of the aerodynamic forces and consequently the performance of a roof top ventilator.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wake survey</field><field name="subject">rotating ventilator</field><field name="subject">ventilation</field><field name="subject">heating and ventilation control</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19076</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oh what a tangled web ... : Building capacity for environmental health action in Australia</field><field name="creator">Nicholson, Rosemary J., Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the early years of the 21st century environmental health has to contend not only with the more 'traditional' and essentially localised environmental risks to human health. We now face the additional challenges posed by a range of 'modern' environmental health issues. These are characteristically more complex, more ubiquitous, and much less clearly defined than any we have previously encountered. They have been brought about through rapid industrial expansion, technological advances that have transformed our social structures and the emergence of a global economy that is now forging ahead in the face of ever-increasing socio-economic inequity. These are problems that are not amenable to traditional environmental health solutions. They call instead for new, innovative and integrative strategies based on cooperative and collaborative working partnerships. This thesis explores the question of what needs to be done to build capacity for such partnerships among environmental health stakeholders in Australia. The current situation is clarified through a critical review of the author?s professional career, the historical development of environmental health practice, the different knowledge constructs of four distinguishable stakeholder groups and the objectives and guiding principles of Australia's National Environmental Health Strategy. A case study of a federally funded collaborative environmental health project serves to highlight some of the inherent challenges of intersectoral partnership and community participation. The metaphor of the spider's web illustrates the imperative of such partnerships among stakeholder groups and across all geographical scales from the local to the global. Finally, the barriers to be overcome in building environmental health capacity are analysed through a force field analysis. The study concludes with an analysis of the constituents of action necessary to develop the partnering capabilities of the various stakeholders, to build supportive community and organisational infrastructures and to demonstrate the political will of government to support change.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental health</field><field name="subject">environmental management</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">planning</field><field name="subject">administration</field><field name="subject">National Environmental Health Strategy (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Community-based Environmental Health Action Project (Australia)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Respiratory function as a measure of muscle strength in young boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</field><field name="creator">Webster, Richard Ian, School of Women &amp; Children's Health, UNSW</field><field name="description">AIMS: To evaluate the use of Manual Muscle Strength Tests (MMST), Timed Functional Tests (TFT) and Respiratory Function Tests (RFT) as measures of muscle strength in young boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and specifically to evaluate the use of Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF). BACKGROUND: There is a need to measure the effect of treatments that potentially increase muscle strength in DMD. PEF may have advantages over Vital Capacity (VC) as a measure of respiratory function in young boys with DMD. METHODS: 17 boys with DMD (aged 5-10 years) were assessed regularly over one year. Assessment involved Respiratory Function Testing (PEF, VC, Forced Expiratory Volume in one second [FEV1]), Timed Functional Testing (walking 9 metres, climbing four stairs, arising from supine) and MMST. A single investigator performed MMST and TFTs. A separate investigator performed RFTs. For RFTs a percentage of predicted was calculated [PEF(%), FEV1(%), VC(%)].11/17 boys were treated with prednisolone which increases strength in DMD. RESULTS: At baseline, all boys had significant weakness. Mean (+/- SD) PEF(%) 69 +/- 13% and VC(%) 77 +/- 18% were abnormal. Baseline PEF(%) predicted correlated with MMST (P=0.003) and time to walk 9 metres (P=0.022). Baseline VC(%) correlated with MMST (P=0.049). There was a consistent statistically significant correlation between MMST and all TFTs. PEF was performed well on 80% of occasions, spirometry on 65%. Changes in PEF(%) showed statistically significant correlation with changes in all TFTs. The correlation was not statistically significant for VC(%) or FEV1(%). Prednisolone treated boys did better than those not treated. PEF, time to walk 9 metres and time to climb 4 stairs showed statistically significant improvement. The mean improvement from baseline in PEF(%) was 19 +/-14% in treated and 2 +/- 7% in untreated boys (P=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: MMST, TFTs and RFTs are valid measures of muscle strength in young boys with DMD. PEF is abnormal in young boys with DMD; correlates with other measures of strength and is sensitive to changes in strength. PEF is more easily performed than spirometry and has a role in monitoring muscle strength in young boys with DMD.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Duchenne muscular dystrophy</field><field name="subject">Muscular dystrophy</field><field name="subject">Muscle strength</field><field name="subject">Respiratory agents</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and simulation of electronically controlled diesel injectors</field><field name="creator">Tran, Xuan-Thien, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The study presents a one-dimensional, transient and compressible flow models of a commercial Common Rail Injector (CRI) and a prototype of a single-fuel Hydraulically actuated Electrically controlled Unit Injector (HEUI) developed at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in conjunction with local industry. The unique feature of the UNSW HEUI is the fact that it uses diesel fuel as the driver for pressure amplification within the unit injector. The work undertaken is part of a wider study aimed at optimization of the design of diesel injectors for dual-fuel systems to reduce green house gas emissions. The contribution of this thesis is the development of the model of the UNSW HEUI injector, which can be used to investigate possible modifications of the injector for its use in dual-fuel injection systems.  The developed models include electrical, mechanical and hydraulic subsystems present in the injectors. They are based on Kirchhoff??s laws, on the mass and momentum conservation equations and on the equilibrium of forces. The models were implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK graphical software environment, which provides a high degree of flexibility and allows simulation of both linear and nonlinear elements. The models were used to perform sensitivity analysis of both injectors. The sensitivity analysis has revealed that the temperature of the solenoid coil is one of the critical parameters affecting the timing and the quantity of the fuel injection of both injectors. Additional critical parameters were found to be the dimensions of the piston of the CRI, the stiffness of the needle spring of the HEUI and the dimensions of the intensifier of the HEUI. The models also revealed that in the case of pilot injections the speed of the solenoid is the major limiting factor of the performance. The developed models provide better understanding of the issues and limitations of the injectors. They give detailed insight into their working principles. The investigations of the models permit making quantitative analysis of the timing of the HEUI solenoid and to evaluate the proposed change of the direction of the pressure acting on the HEUI solenoid plunger.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diesel motor -- Fuel systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Burning the Interface : artists' interactive multimedia 1992 - 1998</field><field name="creator">Leggett, Michael Graham, College of Fine Art &amp; Design, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis describes the development during the 1990s of visual artists' utilisation of computer-based interactive multimedia and the production internationally, with a focus on Australian artists, of artworks on the CD-ROM media format.

In particular, BHP and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation held the principal interest, as this research effort was a part of the investigation into the utilisation of X-80 steel in naval platforms. After some initial considerations, this research effort focussed on the development of X-80 steel blast tolerant transverse bulkheads. Unfortunately, due to the Australian Maritime Engineering Cooperative Research Centre not being re-funded after June 2000 and other project factors, the planned blast tests were not conducted, hence this research effort focussed on the tools needed for the formation of optimised blast tolerant transverse bulkheads rather than on the development of a single structural arrangement. Design criteria were formed from the worst case operational requirements for a transverse bulkhead, which would experience a 150 kg equivalent blast load at 8 m from the source. Since the development of any optimised blast tolerant structure had to be carried out using finite element analysis, material constants for X-80 steel under high strain rates were obtained. These material constants were implemented in the finite element analysis and the appropriate solid element size was evolved. The behaviour and effects of stress waves and high strain rates were considered and the literature reviewed, in particular consideration was given to joint structures and weld areas effects on the entire structural response to a blast load. Furthermore, to support the design criteria, rupture prediction and determination methodologies have been investigated and recommendations developed about their relevance. Since the response of transverse bulkheads is significantly affected by their joint and stiffener arrangements, separate investigations of these structures were undertaken. The outcomes of these investigations led to improvements in the blast tolerance behaviour of joints and stiffeners, which also improved the overall response of the transverse bulkhead to air blast loads. Finally, an optimisation procedure was developed that met all the design criteria and its relevant requirements. This optimisation procedure was implemented with the available data, to show the potential to develop optimised X-80 steel blast tolerant transverse bulkheads. Due to the constraints mentioned above the optimisation procedure was restricted, but did show progression towards more effective blast tolerant transverse bulkhead designs. Factors, such as double skin bulkheads, maximising plate separation, and the use of higher yield steel all showed to be beneficial in the development of optimal X-80 steel blast tolerant transverse bulkheads, when compared to the ANZACclass D-36 steel transverse bulkheads.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bulkheads (Naval architecture)</field><field name="subject">Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Damage control (Warships)</field><field name="subject">Blast effect</field><field name="subject">Marine steel</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20467</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Top management turnover: an empirical examination of changes in portfolio holdings and investment performance</field><field name="creator">Nadarajah, Prashanthi, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents two research projects examining the relationship between top management turnover (i.e. investment directors of funds management firms) and the performance of actively managed Australian institutional funds.  Khorana (1996, 2001) studies this relationship from purely a performance perspective using U.S. managed funds.  This thesis extends the work of Khorana (1996, 2001) by providing investors and other stakeholders with empirical evidence on performance, sources of performance and the dynamics of portfolios in the pre-and-post replacement periods.  This issue is significant given the importance of executive management in the implementation of the institution's investment strategy, the sizeable assets under their control, as well as the overall success and profitability of the funds management operation.  In addition, investors, asset consultants, managed fund ratings agencies and the financial media devote significant resources in scrutinizing the performance, organizational activities, leadership and human capital of investment management firms.  Accordingly, the first research project examines the impact of performance and fund flow activity on top management turnover in both the pre-and-post replacement periods.  The research documents that turnover of underperforming investment managers results in significantly higher performance in the post-replacement period, while turnover coinciding with outperforming managers delivers investors significantly lower returns (risk-adjusted).  The evidence also identifies significant changes in portfolio risk associated with managerial turnover.  Finally, the study finds that underperforming investment managers exhibit significantly lower fund flows prior to replacement.  The second research project represents the first rigorous analysis of top management turnover with respect to monthly portfolio holdings for a sample of actively managed Australian equity funds.  An examination of the dynamics of portfolios surrounding both the departure and the arrival dates of investment managers provides a finer decomposition in understanding investment performance, the sources of value added and the extent to which momentum strategies are executed both pre-and-post the turnover event.  Accordingly, the study examines a manager's success or failure depending on 'winner' and 'loser' stock holdings, portfolio turnover, reliance on momentum strategies, variation in portfolio risk, stock preferences and fund flows for underperforming versus outperforming investment directors in the pre-and-post replacement periods.  The research also documents that new investment managers of previously underperforming portfolios exhibit superior stock-selections skills in the post-replacement period, therefore reversing the portfolio's previously poor performance.  The study finds that new investment managers liquidate 'loser' stocks (i.e. cleaning out the portfolio) as well as decreasing the portfolio's concentration (i.e. increases the portfolio's diversification and lowering tracking error).  The results also indicate that underperforming investment managers in the pre-replacement period exhibit a preference for larger stocks (i.e. more liquid stocks with greater relative benchmark weights in the index), growth-oriented securities and a preference towards riding past period winners (i.e. following momentum strategies), however they are unable to successfully select and exploit momentum stocks.  On the other hand, incoming managers of underperforming portfolios in the pre-replacement period do not show any particular stock size preference.  The study also shows these managers prefer growth stocks, do not rely on momentum strategies, and yet still display superior returns in the post-replacement period. The study also documents that new investment managers of previously outperforming portfolios are unable to replicate the performance of the previous head of equities.  In terms of stock preferences related to superior performing portfolios, the results show that departing investment managers prefer larger stocks and select stocks based on momentum strategies.  On the other hand, incoming investment managers have a greater preference for smaller stocks, are less reliant on momentum strategies and prefer more volatile securities, however, these strategies do not provide superior returns relative to the pre-replacement period.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Investment</field><field name="subject">Portfolio</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Institutional investments--Australia</field><field name="subject">Portfolio management--Australia</field><field name="subject">Corporate governance--Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vertical and horizontal methods of peer learning in clinical examination skills</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Paul Simon, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Peer-learning enhances the learning experience of students, but little research in this area has studied medical students developing their clinical physical examination skills.  This thesis describes two peer-learning processes to aid this skill development: peer???learning from advanced beginners to novices (vertical); and peer-to-peer learning (horizontal).  The hypothesis was that the process would be effective and acceptable to tutors and tutees.  Vertical Peer Teaching: After a successful pilot scheme using junior doctors to tutor medical students, senior medical students were engaged as tutors as the junior doctors were too busy.  Following instruction in tutoring and defining teaching topics, they taught a group of junior students. Evaluation of both groups was by summative clinical examination scores, by interviews and questionnaires. Scores were compared with non-participating control subjects.  Tutors showed a significantly superior examination performance compared with the control group. Tutees showed a non-significant improvement.  Tutors considered their skills had improved, with increased confidence in both performance and teaching, particularly in the communication and metacognitive domains.  Tutees indicated the process to be very useful, with increased opportunity for feedback and questioning.  There was little evidence of a reduction in the barriers between the years, perhaps because the student tutors were viewed in the traditional role of 'experts' .  Horizontal Peer Teaching: Same-level dyads using a videotaped examination skill and script were assessed by summative examination and subjectively.  These skills showed a significant improvement when compared to a control group.  Despite this effect and many positive aspects reported, there were some concerns with the process.  Students felt that a videotape and a peer instead of an ???expert??? was not as good as a traditional tutorial.  In conclusion, the peer-learning was successful in several domains.  Vertical peer-learning was accepted by both tutors and tutees, and horizontal-peer learning had a positive influence upon examination results.  Vertical peer-learning appears to conform to students??? expectations of the inequality between beginners and tutors who are advanced beginners or experts, while horizontal peer-learning is more challenging, even though it is effective.  The latter may need careful introduction for the process to be acceptable to students.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Peer-group tutoring of students</field><field name="subject">Clinical medicine</field><field name="subject">Physical diagnosis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The announcement effect of private placements of hybrid securities in Australia</field><field name="creator">Tan, Juan Edward, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the share price response to the announcement of private placements of hybrid securities in Australia.  Firstly, the size and direction of the share price response is examined.  Secondly, the determinants of the share price response are examined.  Where possible, comparisons are made to evidence from international markets.  The sample of data tested consists of 43 announcements of convertible debt issues, 39 announcements of preference share issues and 19 announcements of option issues made between 1983 and 2000 by Australian firms.  The analysis of the share price impact in response to the announcements is conducted using Maynes and Rumsey (1993) event study methodology that adjusts for thin trading.  The determinants of the share price response are examined using model specifications that are derived from the theoretical literature.  The analysis of the announcement effect of private placements of hybrid securities finds significant negative abnormal returns for convertible debt issues, insignificant negative abnormal returns for preference share issues and significant positive abnormal returns for option issues.  In comparison to international studies, the convertible debt results are similar to public and rights issues, the insignificant preference share results are similar to other findings and the option results are similar to private placements of equity and rights issues of options.

Assessment techniques have developed to meet different applications, but all have problems and none is entirely suited to the assessment of risks relating to fire. This dissertation examines the development of risk assessment processes and frameworks, identifying common features and problems and key differences in approach. Despite generically similar approaches, different applications have led to the development of many different paradigms, none of which appears to be entirely suitable for application to building and infrastructure fires. Current fire risk assessment methods which incorporate important advances in fire modelling and Monte Carlo simulation, rely on a fire engineering approach. They tend to consider only the limited range of fire safety systems that are directly involved in construction, failing to address many of the procedural and other activities that can overwhelm traditional controls, and taking insufficient account of interactions between different controls and the factors that influence them. Further, comparative risk levels are generally evaluated against the ill-defined scenario of current practice, as defined in outdated prescriptive regulations. The result is that catastrophic consequences continue to occur, despite the presence of traditionally accepted controls. The problem is to find a framework that evaluates the sensitivity of levels of risk in fire against a defined, uncontrolled state, taking into account the effects of a comprehensive range of factors and controls. A new approach to risk assessment that addresses a comprehensive set of factors and controls and evaluates the event without, and with, controls, is considered. The framework, together with the steps for its implementation, appears to provide a versatile and flexible method of risk assessment. It is likely that the framework can be applied to all risk assessment situations. A study is undertaken to investigate the impact of factors and interactions that are not commonly taken into account in fire risk assessment. The chosen situation is a fire in the driver???s cab of a train. Current driver procedures are examined, and fire growth rates for specified materials are considered. Using the fire spread model CFAST, conditions in the cab for a range of ventilation conditions and fire growth rates are calculated. Threshold levels that determine response times for engineered and human controls and tenability, and common factors that influence consequences, can play a critical role in modelling the decision process. A driver???s decision model is proposed that determines the impact of the driver???s decisions to adjust ventilation by opening or closing windows and doors, and to extinguish the fire. The model takes into account time to respond and time to perform the necessary activities. The study shows that, even with a limited choice of actions, the decisions of the driver can have a critical effect on the outcome of a fire in the driver???s cab, altering the situation from a controlled to an uncontrolled state. Recommendations are made for further development of the new risk assessment framework, and for the development of fire modelling for risk assessment purposes. Finally, recommendations are made for the continuation of the development of the train driver response model that would result in the generation of driver decision support software.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fire prevention</field><field name="subject">Risk assessment</field><field name="subject">Buildings</field><field name="subject">Safety measures</field><field name="subject">Transportation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20555</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the desingularised boundary-element method and viscous roll damping</field><field name="creator">Matsubara, Shinsuke, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Two major areas were studied in this research to achieve more efficient and optimised method for the prediction of ship motion, and this research has two aims. The first aim was to improve an algorithm of the oscillatory problems for strip theory by means of reducing numerical integration using the desingularised method. A new way of distributing point sources was developed by the author in order to solve the boundary problem on the source distribution. Results showed that desingularsation can be utilised on rounded hull shapes. Although the desingularsation process reduces the computational time, the conventional method is more robust and stable due to the simple source panel distribution. The second aim was an investigation of viscous roll damping of ship motion with the influence of forward velocity, and several numerical simulations were developed in order to support wind-tunnel experimentation. The wind tunnel experimentation was conducted by using a 1.2 m NACA6521 modified cylindrical-bulb model to investigate the viscous effect on the rolling motion of the ship. Since viscous damping was very small under restrictions from the experimental condition, a normal method of collecting data of roll motion, in which a device is physically attached on the bulb model, was not suitable. As a solution, remote sensing was utilised to capture the motion picture by a digital video camera. A visual analysis was then conducted to obtain data of the roll motion of the bulb model inside the wind-tunnel test section. Two different numerical simulations were developed under the hypothesis that the forward velocity influences the boundary layer generation to cause viscous roll damping on the ship model hull. The first numerical simulation uses the energy method to produce damping coefficients, and the second numerical simulation requires solving the motion of equation numerically. It was discovered that the increase of forward velocity results in a linear increase of the viscous damping coefficient. The numerical simulation and experimental data agree closely. Therefore, the theory used to predict the viscous roll damping was shown to be reasonably accurate.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stability of ships</field><field name="subject">Damping (Mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Boundary element methods.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Space and dwelling : an interrogation of the relationship between public space, values, boundaries and belonging</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Gaye L., Design Studies, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This document examines the public spaces created by the built environment of the city and asks: How is it that the apparently benign and benevolent activity of designing public space can in fact reinforce values that effectively marginalise and exclude significant groups of people? It contrasts the consequences of design decisions that are based on a value system of ???either/or??? with the possibility for designs based on ???both/and???. The perception of boundaries, the desire to dwell, the need to belong and the relationship of these phenomena to an understanding of ???self???, is proposed as the key means for analysing how public space is experienced by the user.  The document uses the language of barriers and boundaries to interrogate how the value systems of those with the control over resources is manifest in the built environment of the city, and examines the impact such environments have on the user???s desire to ???dwell??? and need to belong. The potential for an alternate paradigm based on a system that recognises ???both/and??? to produce beneficial outcomes is then proposed, with a focus on an ethic of care to complement the ethic of justice that currently guides design decisions for public space. Personal interviews with architects, town planners, representatives from relevant government agencies, and users of public space, participation in public meetings and systematic observation of specific sites have been used to inform the argument and assess the validity of claims. The document is extended by a body of visual work that further interrogates the need to belong and broader issues of the primal significance of ???sanctuary??? to the ability to ???dwell???. The making and maintaining of boundaries, necessary to form a sanctuary, is portrayed as a process fraught with insecurities and vulnerabilities necessitating, in circumstances where personal power or the ability to influence one???s environment is diminished, the use of subversive tactics in order to create a space in which one can belong.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public spaces</field><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">Dwellings in art</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20572</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Significance, the vessel and the domestic</field><field name="creator">Brown, Sandra Lois, School of Design, UNSW</field><field name="description">Throughout history, people have made or acquired vessels from which to sip their favourite beverage.  In the contemporary domestic setting, households frequently accumulate multiples of the same type of object in numbers that are considerably greater than is necessary and practical for use alone.  Of these many objects there are often individual pieces that have special significance for the owner or user. Some are so valued that they may even be removed and set aside because of their perceived importance.   The research was initiated by a previous study of tea drinking vessels coupled with a desire, as an object maker and collector, to find out why people have special items that they designate as personally important. The aim was to identify how significance could be recognised in specific objects and whether the notion that a group of features used to gauge such objects could be conveyed into studio based work.  The research outcomes are evidenced in a text-based document (which articulates the theoretical and empirical elements of the enquiry) and a body of creative studio work developed in response to aspects of the investigation.  The document encompasses two components of the study. The first references material from the fields of museum and cultural studies, pivotal in focusing the enquiry.  This contributed to the compilation of a general and speculative inventory of qualities that might pertain to objects deemed ???significant???. During these early investigations it became evident that a more in depth and contemporary analysis of significant drinking vessels, their owners and/or users was required.  A Survey Questionnaire regarding personal use and special drinking vessels preceded a series of Interviews with a selected group of Australia curators, artists, academics and collectors who discussed and analysed their association with a personally significant drinking vessel.  Subsequently, the content of these interviews became central to the focus of the research and outcomes. The research isolates a number of attributes that are commonly identified in objects that, whatever their condition, are deemed ???significant???.  These describe the maker, usage, ownership, association and historical context.  The perceived value or worth of the object for its owner, is recognised as a consequence of significance and declares the object as distinctive. This outcome is clearly validated by the interviews.  The studio work develops from the fusion of personal narrative that has been enhanced by findings of the research.  In particular, it references the cherished object, most especially those pieces that have been retained despite the ravages of time and use. The resulting work was exhibited as Trace Elements ???

Along with those changes, industry risks have also been transformed significantly. Prior to restructuring, government-owned or carefully regulated monopoly private utilities would manage most of these industry risks. With restructuring, however, both the government, through their market regulators, and industry participants need to manage a range of previous,, yet also now new, risks. While the government???s risk management strategy is focused on the industry as a whole, participants are naturally more concerned with their individual risks. The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) is one of the many electricity markets that were formed through the restructuring process underway worldwide. It created a number of new types of market participants facing different sets of risks. The main objective of this thesis is to examine the management of market risk by these different NEM participants. The methodology used in the thesis involves developing a fundamental understanding of electricity restructuring, the NEM and the various risks faced by the different NEM participants. Data on NEM spot prices, ancillary costs and forward prices are analysed to gain a better understanding of its relationship with market activities. Different risk management strategies, both proactive and reactive, that can be taken by the participants are discussed This thesis has highlighted some of the complexities involved in managing risks in a restructured electricity industry. Risks are never static and changes in market conditions alter the risk exposure of the participants. Therefore, participants will need to constantly monitor their risk exposure and update their risk management strategies. The Cash-Flow-at-Risk methodology is introduced as a possible tool to measure risk and analyse risk management options for different NEM participants.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electric power</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Electric utilities</field><field name="subject">Economic aspects</field><field name="subject">Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A biomechanical analysis of patient handling techniques and equipment in a remote setting.</field><field name="creator">Muriti, Andrew John, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Remote area staff performing manual patient handling tasks in the absence of patient lifting hoists available in most health care settings are at an elevated risk of musculoskeletal injuries.  The objective of this project was to identify the patient handling methods that have the lowest risk of injury.  The patient handling task of lifting a patient from floor to a chair or wheelchair is a common task performed in a remote health care setting.  The task was performed utilising three methods, these being: (1) heads/tails lift, (2) use of two Blue MEDesign?? slings and (3) use of a drawsheet.  The task of the heads/tails lift was broken down into two distinctly separate subtasks: lifting from the (1) head and (2) tail ends of the patient load.  These techniques were selected based on criteria including current practice, durability, portability, accessibility, ease of storage and cost to supply.  Postural data were obtained using a Vicon 370 three - dimensional motion measurement and analysis system in the Biomechanics &amp; Gait laboratory at the University of New South Wales.  Forty reflective markers were placed on the subject to obtain the following joint angles: ankle, knee, hip, torso, shoulder, elbow, and wrist.  The raw data were converted into the respective joint angles (Y, X, Z) for further analysis.  The postural data was analysed using the University of Michigan???s Three-Dimensional Static Strength Prediction Program (3D SSPP) and the relative risk of injury was based on the following three values: (1) a threshold value of 3,400 N for compression force, (2) a threshold value of 500 N for shear force, and (3) population strength capability data.  The effects on changes to the anthropometric data was estimated and analysed using the in-built anthropometric data contained within the 3D SSPP program for 6 separate lifter scenarios, these being male and female 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles.  Changes to the patient load were estimated and analysed using the same computer software.  Estimated compressive and shear forces were found to be lower with the drawsheet and tail component of the heads/tails lift in comparison to the use of the Blue MEDesign?? straps and head component of the heads/tails lift.  The results obtained for the strength capability aspect of each of the lifts indicated a higher percentage of the population capable of both the drawsheet and tail end of the heads/tails lift.  The relative risk of back injury for the lifters is distributed more evenly with the drawsheet lift as opposed to the heads/tails (tail) lift where risk is disproportionate with the heavier end being lifted. The use of lifter anthropometrics does not appear to be a realistic variable to base assumptions on which group of the population are capable of safely performing this task in a remote setting. This study advocates the use of the drawsheet lift in a remote setting based on the author???s experience and the biomechanical results obtained in this study.  The drawsheet lift is both more accessible and provides a more acceptable risk when more than two patient handlers are involved, in comparison to the other lifts utilised lifting patients from floor to a chair.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Patient Handling</field><field name="subject">Biomechanical</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="subject">Remote Health</field><field name="subject">Patients</field><field name="subject">Positioning</field><field name="subject">Rural health services</field><field name="subject">Lifting and carrying</field><field name="subject">Safety measures</field><field name="subject">Biomechanics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus in an antenatal population : an epidemiological study</field><field name="creator">Polis, Suzanne, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Although Australian epidemiology of HBV and HCV has been well described for populations groups at higher risk, but the information available for groups generally considered to be lower risk is much more limited. An understanding of the prevalence of these infections and their risk factors in antenatal women is important to guide testing policy and practice. A study was therefore conducted of the epidemiology of hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection in women. In addition, women were asked about their experience with antenatal testing. A total of 516 women participated in the survey, of these 479 (95%) women had been tested for HCV antibodies .The prevalence of HCV antibodies was 4% overall, and 2% among women who were unaware of their HCV status prior to their antenatal test. A history of injecting drug use and residing with a HCV positive person were significantly associated with HCV infection in multivariate analyses. HBV testing was conducted in 468 (99.6%) of women, and the overall prevalence was 2%. Risk factors identified were birthplace in countries of South East Asia. Women were asked about their perception of antenatal testing and pre-test information. Nearly a third (143, 30.5%) of women who had been tested for HCV infection either said that they did not know whether they had been tested, or said that they had declined testing. The corresponding proportion for HBV infection was 28.8% (135). Over 65% and 66% of women said that had not received any information about testing for HCV and HBV respectively. The finding that virtually all antenatal women were being tested for HCV was in contrast to government and non-government organisation policies of ???selective??? screening in place during the study period. Of concern was the substantial proportion of women who were tested despite reporting that they had declined their clinician???s offer to test for HCV and HBV, and the large number of women who reported an absence of pre-test information. Women who said they had received information reported the delivery and quality of information varied according to the antenatal clinician group, but perceived the overall quality as poor.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hepatitis B</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C</field><field name="subject">Prenatal diagnosis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Executive compensation and firm performance</field><field name="creator">Tian, Shu, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study considers the determination of the ex ante pay-performance relationship. A single-period partial equilibrium model is used to show that the executive income can be expressed as a function of the firm's return expressed in dollar terms. The executive income is jointly determined by the opening firm size and current return, which function as a managerial talent proxy and self-selection mechanism respectively. Comparing to Jensen and Murphy (1990) wealth-based Pay-Performance Sensitivity (PPS), this research presents an income-based PPS. The alternative PPS not only overcomes a misleading misspecification in Jensen and Murphy (1990), but also corrects Rosen's (1992) argument for only including return in the pay performance relationship. This research finds empirically that both the opening firm size and stock return play a significant role in determining executive income. This study provides supplementary evidence to Murphy's (1986) Learning Model.

However, mineralogical studies are seldom incorporated in reservoir assessment. The objectives of the study were to investigate the influence of mineralogy on petrophysical properties of petroleum reservoir beds and the application of mineralogical studies in reservoir evaluation. Mineralogical analyses were performed on core samples from the Plover Formation, the principal reservoir sequence in the Northwest Shelf area of Australia, intersected in two separate wells in the Laminaria petroleum field. The techniques used included X-ray powder and oriented-aggregate analysis, optical microscopy and whole rock geochemistry. Quantification of each mineral phase based on whole-rock powder data was performed using the Rietveld-based Siroquant technique. Results from the Siroquant assay were used as an indicator of mineralogy for the individual samples and were compared with core plug and geophysical log data. X-ray micro-tomography analysis of selected samples was also performed. The reservoir sequences in both wells were sand-dominated, consisted mostly of quartz, clay mineral matrix and cement of silica, pyrite or calcite. The abundance of clay minerals increased in the shale and shaly sandstone intervals. Comparison of mineralogical and core plug analyses of samples from the same depths showed that the down-hole variations in porosity, permeability, grain density and radioactivity were accompanied by changes in mineralogy. Higher proportion of clay minerals in shales was indicated by higher gamma log signals. The gamma log may be taken as an indicator of shaliness only in intervals where kaolinite is proportional to the quantity of illitic clays. Sonic log and neutron log porosity values are comparable with core plug porosity data in sandstone intervals. However, clay minerals increase the sonic log response, thereby increasing porosity in shaly intervals. Clay minerals tend to decrease the neutron log response causing higher porosity indication in shales, similar to that expected in sandstones. Routine density log analysis underestimated porosity values because of the contribution of dense minerals to the bulk density of the formation. Use of laboratory determined grain and fluid densities resulted in improved density log porosity compared to core porosity. X-ray tomography analysis revealed an overall positive correlation between mineralogy and porosity data. Routine geophysical log evaluation revealed inconsistent results when compared to core analysis data because of the influence of minerals on various logs. It is essential that mineralogical studies be included in reservoir assessment. X-ray tomography may provide an alternative approach in evaluating porosity and mineralogy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">petroleum</field><field name="subject">geology</field><field name="subject">hydrocarbon reservoirs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What brand &lt;are you?&gt; : reconnoitering happiness</field><field name="creator">Bodzick, Marlo, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Today desires are often confused with needs.

By using this fast paced digital aesthetic based in motion-graphics, coupled with split as well as multiple screens, I reference the hyper-reality created by advertising and bestowed upon brands.   In my video I raise, and sometimes provoke, questions such as: What is our 'brand' as people? Are we too, objects that can and should be branded? How do we feel about that?   Why do we attach ourselves so strongly to certain things or brands? Do we believe it will make us happy? Where does happiness exist for us?

This study presents a review of the current available methods for estimating critical coning rate for both vertical and horizontal wells. The various methods and correlations are compared and the assumptions on which they are based evaluated. Following comparison made between the correlations, the most reliable theories are identified for both vertical and horizontal wells separately. Among the correlations for vertical wells, this study recommends two implicit methods presented by Wheatley and Azar Nejad et al. They determined the oil potential distribution influenced by water cone with a remarkable accuracy. For horizontal wells, two methods, Joshi???s equation and Rechem et al formula, are considered to be the most reliable. Joshi???s equation provides lower estimates than Chaperon???s correlation in which the water cone effect on oil potential was neglected. The Recham et al formula also gives a similar result.

In most cases, the underlying genetic defect is unknown. Recessive nuclear gene mutations, rather than mitochondrial DNA mutations, account for the majority of cases. AIM: Our aim was to identify the genetic basis of complex I deficiency in 34 patients with isolated complex I deficiency, by studying six of the 39 nuclear encoded complex I subunit genes (NDUFV1, NDUFS1, NDUFS2, NDUFS4, NDUFS7 and NDUFS8). These genes have been conserved throughout evolution and carry out essential aspects of complex I function. METHODS: RNA was extracted from patient fibroblasts and cDNA made by reverse transcription. Overlapping amplicons that together spanned the entire coding area of each gene were amplified by PCR.  The genes were screened for mutations using denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (dHPLC). Patient samples with abnormal dHPLC profiles underwent direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Novel mutations were identified in six of 34 (18%) patients with isolated complex I deficiency. Five patients had two mutations identified and one patient had a single mutation in NDUFS4 identified. All patients with mutations had a progressive encephalopathy and five out of six had Leigh syndrome or Leigh like syndrome. Mutations were found in three nuclear encoded subunit genes, NDUFV1, NDUFS2 and NDUFS4. Three novel NDUFV1 mutations were identified (R386H, K111E and P252R). The R386H mutation was found in two apparently unrelated patients. Four novel NDUFS2 mutations were identified (R221X, M292T, R333Q and IVS9+4A&amp;ltG). The novel NDUFS4 mutation c.221delC was found in two patients - one in homozygous form and the other heterozygous. Specific genotype and phenotype correlations were not identified.

The SVJJ model structure allows for simultaneous jumps in price and volatility processes, with correlated jump size distributions. To the best of our knowledge this is the first empirical study to test the hedging performance of the SVJJ model. As part of our research we derive the SVJJ model minimum variance hedge ratio.  We find the SVJ model displays the best price prediction. The SV model lacks the structural complexity to eliminate Black Scholes pricing biases, whereas our results indicate the SVJJ model suffers from overfitting.  Despite significant evidence from in and out-of-sample pricing that the SV and SVJ models were better specified than the BS model, this did not result in an improvement in dynamic hedging performance. Overall the BS delta hedge and SV minimum variance hedge produced the lowest errors, although their performance across moneyness-maturity categories differed greatly. The SVJ model???s results were surprisingly poor given its superior performance in out-of-sample pricing. We attribute the inadequate performance of the jump models to the lower hedging ratios these models provided, which may be a result of the negative expected jump sizes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Option Pricing</field><field name="subject">Affine Jump Diffusion</field><field name="subject">Stochastic Volatility</field><field name="subject">Hedging Finance</field><field name="subject">Options Finance</field><field name="subject">Prices</field><field name="subject">Jump processes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22379</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial order and sense of community in high-rise apartment developments in Bundang, the metropolitan area of Seoul, Korea</field><field name="creator">Lee, Seok Heon, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to investigate the relationship between the provision of spatial order and perceived sense of community in high-rise housing developments in Korea from a socio-spatial and architectural perspective. It also considers relationships between the perception of neighbourhood, provision of facilities, design aspects, and socio-economic characteristics and sense of community. The study uses a questionnaire survey as the main research instrument conducted across four case studies in Bundang new town, in metropolitan Seoul, Korea. Two of the cases were selected as having a high provision of spatial order and the other two low provision according to the concepts of Altman (1975) and Newman (1972, 1975). Quantitative analysis is carried out using the Kruskal-Wallis/Mann-Whitney test and Spearman???s rank correlation to identify differences and correlations between cases. The results indicate that there is no clear evidence that a sense of community has a direct relationship with the provision of spatial order in the selected cases. However, in the high provision cases outdoor common spaces appear to have a role in contributing to social interaction. Among Buckner???s (1988) three sub-variables of his concept of neighbourhood cohesion, ???neighbouring??? appears to be more associated with the provision of spatial order rather than ???attraction-to-neighbourhood??? or ???psychological sense of community.??? A greater number of opportunities for social interactions occur in an intermediate space located between private dwelling units and public open space in cases with a high provision of spatial order. However, this is likely to be due to the location of shared facilities and their frequency of use. In terms of the relationship between design and a sense of community, ???landscaping??? was found to be the most important variable, followed by the ???design of streets/footpath??? and ???facilities for children???, ???parking???, and ???recreational activities???. Despite the lack of a clear relationship between design and a sense of community, a strong demand was found for improved outdoor amenity and greater provision of facilities. Socio-economic status appears not to be a significant factor directly influencing the sense of community however, age and the existence of children are associated with the perception of neighbourhood.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high rise apartment buildings</field><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">human factors</field><field name="subject">Korea</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">???A CROWDED HOUSE??? Using an action research approach to address the problem of access block at Tertiary Referral Hospital. January to July 2003</field><field name="creator">Daly, Barbara, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Issue Addressed: Access block (the prolonged wait for an inpatient hospital bed after emergency department (ED) treatment) is regarded as one of the major issues currently facing emergency medicine both in Australia and internationally. At this tertiary referral hospital review of existing data has indicated that access block has continued to increase in recent years, with a sharp rise in emergency access problems since July 1999 and is now identified as a system wide problem. Objective: This research thesis sought to explore four main areas of inquiry concerning access issues within this hospital. The first objective was to determine the current bed capacity of this hospital and identify the percentage of access block within this system. The second objective was to seek an understanding of hospital clinicians??? experiences of access block and to identify the factors they perceive directly influence patient access to acute in-patient care. The third objective was to identify change strategies to improve patient access. The final objective was to determine whether collaborative participation and involvement of clinicians would lead to a change in hospital culture and foster a collective ownership of access block as a hospital wide problem. Method: In a participatory action research inquiry, hospital clinicians within this hospital were invited to be co-researchers. The process of concurrent investigation and action followed a five- part sequence of entry, issue identification, planning, action and reflection. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods were used including in-depth semi structured interviews, focus groups, process mapping, control charts and statistical analysis. Results: The research findings revealed a consistently high level of access block experienced by this hospital with bed occupancy rates in excess of 90%. During the study, hospital clinicians??? became actively involved in identifying major access issues. Six main delay categories evolved: Access delays due to limited imaging and diagnostic services, patient transport delays, barriers within the patient discharges process, insufficient access and availability to transitional, hostel, rehabilitation and nursing home beds and delays due to poor internal processes within the wards. Multi-disciplinary working parties were formed to implement six intervention strategies identified by the hospital clinicians. These included: the development of a patient access database and hospital wide alert system for code red status, the design of a pharmacy discharge prescription tracking system, the establishment of a patient discharge lounge, a quality study of the aged care assessment team within the ED and the formation of a transport working group to evaluate an electronic transport booking system within the hospital. Conclusion: In recording the qualitative process involved in gaining hospital clinicians??? perceptions of the problem of access block some indicators of engagement and empowerment were documented. The success of this participatory action approach is based on the simple principal that those that are doing the job are in the best position to change or improve it.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Market reaction to audit opinions of companies listed on the Shanghai stock exchange</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yi, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study extends research on the information content of qualified audit opinions in more developed markets to the emerging capital market in China. It investigates the market reaction to audit opinions of listed Chinese companies on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. A sample of 3128 company/year observations was included, with 386 modified audit opinions and 2742 unqualified audit opinions during the investigation period 1999 to 2003. The variable of interest is audit opinions. Control variables include those used in studies of developed countries, such as earnings surprise, concurrent bad news disclosure, audit report delay, leverage, the presence of loss and firm size. Also included are variables controlling for specific Chinese institutional characteristics, such as ???special treatment???, as well as bull and bear market indicators. When all modified audit opinions are combined, this study does not find evidence that the modified audit opinions have significant information value to Chinese investors. However, when modified audit opinions are classified by type, the market is found to significantly react to qualified audit opinions with explanatory notes and disclaimer audit opinions, which are the severest audit opinions investigated in this study. When the entire sample is partitioned by year, a significant stock price revision to modified audit opinions is documented in 2003. This study also examined in the Chinese context the Melumad and Ziv (1997) model of stock price response to avoidable and unavoidable modified audit opinions. Consistent with Melumad and Ziv (1997) predictions, the market reaction to avoidable audit reports is unclear, while investors view unavoidable audit reports as necessarily negative information. In conclusion, this study finds mixed evidence in support of the notion that the Chinese stock market views audit opinions as valuable information.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cardiovascular risk in long-term peritoneal dialysis patients</field><field name="creator">Wang, Angela Yee-Moon, Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular disease is responsible for at least half of all deaths in end-stage renal disease patients on maintenance dialysis and is attributed to the very high prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction, cardiac failure, coronary artery disease and other atherosclerotic complications. Apart from traditional risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia, these patients are at risk of accelerated atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular complications as a result of non-traditional risk factors such as inflammation, anemia, increased oxidative stress, hyperparathyroidism and excessive calcium phosphorus load. In recent years, there is an increasing recognition of calcification complications in patients on dialysis. However, the importance and prognostic value of calcification in patients on peritoneal dialysis is not known. Residual renal function has a significant contribution to the overall survival in patients on peritoneal dialysis but whether it is in any way related to cardiovascular death and complications in patients on peritoneal dialysis is not known. Inflammation is highly prevalent in dialysis patients and is considered to play a pathogenic role in cardiovascular disease. In this thesis, we evaluated some of these relatively novel factors that may predispose peritoneal dialysis patients to an increased risk of cardiovascular complications and mortality, including calcification, loss of residual renal function and inflammation. A number of important conclusions were drawn from these studies. First, valvular calcification is a marker of atherosclerosis and shows important associations with malnutrition and inflammation and is an important predictor of mortality and cardiovascular deaths in peritoneal dialysis patients. Second, inflammation, as denoted by either C-reactive protein or vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 shows an important association with residual renal function and cardiac hypertrophy and is associated with mortality and cardiovascular risk in peritoneal dialysis patients. Third, loss of residual renal function is an important cardiovascular risk and combines adversely with C-reactive protein and cardiac hypertrophy to increase cardiovascular mortality in peritoneal dialysis patients. Fourth, resting hypermetabolism and the malnutrition, inflammation and atherosclerosis syndrome are associated phenomena that parallel the decline of residual renal function and predict an increased mortality and cardiovascular death in peritoneal dialysis patients.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cardiovascular system</field><field name="subject">peritoneal dialysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The economics of petroleum exploration and development in India</field><field name="creator">Venugopal, Sajith, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis provides the background to and an analysis of the economics of exploring for and developing oil and gas discoveries in India. It is aimed at helping the oil and gas industry assess the financial attractiveness of investment in that country. The thesis describes the geography, climate, infrastructure, and energy market with an emphasis on how these affect upstream oil and gas industry investment. A detailed description and analysis is given of the petroleum production sharing contract (&amp;quotPSC&amp;quot) terms embodied in India's New Exploration Licensing Policy (&amp;quotNELP&amp;quot), and demonstrates that, depending on negotiations, Government Take under NELP terms is likely to be in the range 50% to 60% for a stand-alone petroleum development. However, PSC terms are regressive for marginal discoveries. In particular, State royalties might hinder the development of small or marginal discoveries and render them uneconomic. As an illustration, depending on the oil price, up to 6 MMbbls of oil in otherwise economically viable small fields in a geological basin might be made uneconomic and left stranded because of the effect of royalties. The thesis also analyses the economics of developing a sample of actual Indian oil and gas fields offshore the east and west coasts of the country in shallow and deep water. Onshore field developments are not analysed because of lack of data. All of the offshore developments analysed are profitable based on past and current economic conditions and knowledge. The majority are also relatively low-risk investments. Finally, the thesis evaluates the profitability of new oil and gas exploration and development offshore the east and west coasts of India. The required minimum size of new exploration prospects are in the range 10 to 17 MMbbls for oil prospects and 138 to 1,100 Bcf for gas prospects assuming a low probability of success. Once a new discovery is made, the required minimum economically developable reserves are 4 to 12 MMbbls for oil discoveries and 63 to 1,400 Bcf for gas discoveries.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">petroleum industry and trade</field><field name="subject">India</field><field name="subject">petroleum.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interruptive communication patterns in the intensive care unit ward round</field><field name="creator">Alvarez, George Francisco, Centre of Health Informatics, UNSW</field><field name="description">Medical error and patient safety have become important issues.  It is clear that medical error is more influenced by systemic factors rather than human characteristics.  Communication patterns, in particular interruptive communication, maybe one of the systemic factors that contribute to the burden of medical error.  Objective:  An exploratory study to examine interruptive communication patterns of healthcare staff within an intensive care unit during ward rounds.  Methods:  The study was conducted in a tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia.  Nine participants were observed individually, for a total of 24 hours, using the Communication Observation Method (COM).  The amount of time spent in conversation,  the number of conversation initiating and number of turn-taking interruptions were recorded.  Results:  Participants averaged 75% [95% confidence interval 72.8-77.2] of their time in communication events during ward rounds. There were 345 conversation-initiating interruptions (C.I.I.) and 492 turn-taking interruptions (T.T.I.). C.I.I. accounted for 37% [95%CI 33.9-40.1] of total communication event time (5hr: 53min).  T.T.I. accounted for 5.3% of total communication event time (56min).  Conclusion:  This is the first study to specifically examine turn-taking interruptions in a clinical setting. Staff in this intensive care unit spent the majority of their time in communication.  Turn taking interruptions within conversations occurred at about the same frequency as conversation initiating interruptions, which have been the subject of earlier studies. These results suggest that the overall burden of interruptions in some settings may be significantly higher than previously suspected.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">interpersonal communication</field><field name="subject">interdisciplinary communication</field><field name="subject">interruption</field><field name="subject">turn-taking interruption</field><field name="subject">medical error</field><field name="subject">short-term memory</field><field name="subject">communication in medicine</field><field name="subject">medical personnel and patient.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23430</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Infant feeding practice and adherence to Ugandan infant feeding guidelines among HIV positive and HIV negative mothers</field><field name="creator">Babirye, Juliet Ndimwibo, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction: In previous decades, the basis of child health and survival strategy in the developing countries has been the promotion of breastfeeding. However, transmission of HIV through breast milk to infants in the postnatal period has caused uncertainty over the best feeding technique. Previous policies in Uganda promoted breastfeeding even among HIV positive mothers without offering an informed choice of feeding mode. Consequently, the Ugandan Ministry of Health developed and adopted policy guidelines on feeding of infants and young children in the context of HIV/AIDS in 2001. However, little is known about their impact on infant feeding behaviour in Bushenyi district. Methods: This cross-sectional study conducted in Bushenyi district, Uganda, compared 94 HIV positive and 100 HIV negative mothers with infants aged less than 12 months on infant feeding practice, on the predictors of the different modes of infant feeding practice, and adherence to Ugandan infant feeding guidelines. Results: All HIV negative and 55% of HIV positive mothers were breastfeeding their infants aged less than 12 months. Among breastfeeding mothers, 85% of the HIV negative were breastfeeding non-exclusively. Of concern to the possibility of HIV transmission, 61% of the HIV positive mothers who were breastfeeding were doing so non-exclusively. Adherence to Ugandan infant feeding guidelines was higher in HIV positive mothers (67%) than in HIV negative mothers (41%).  HIV negative mothers were more likely to be adherent if the mothers??? youngest infant was not a first-born (OR= 0.30, 95% CI = 0.10 ??? 0.88) and if they were aware of HIV transmission during pregnancy (OR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.02 ??? 6.66). The single most predictive factor of adherence among HIV positive mothers was attendance at an infant feeding counselling session (OR= 5.63, 95% CI = 2.15???14.73). Conclusions: Counselling support is necessary for mothers to make infant feeding choices that are viable and sustainable. The self-reported method of assessing adherence in our study could have been sub-optimal and may therefore overestimate the adherent proportions reported here. Addressing development of better assessment methods and methods for improving adherence to guidelines is crucial for preventive strategies. Recommendations: Increase coverage of infant feeding counselling by introducing peer counsellors in the community.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responsibility and accountability in theory and practice: the truth and reconciliation commission???s investigation of human rights abuse in South Africa</field><field name="creator">Carman, Marina, School of Politics &amp; International Relations, UNSW</field><field name="description">The main aims of the investigation conducted here are to draw out important debates in theory and in the South African social context over the concepts of responsibility and accountability for human rights abuse, and to look at how these were present within, and impacted on, discussions within and around the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The TRC did not specifically discuss or define theoretical concepts of responsibility or accountability. However, I argue that it is possible to draw out some important features of its implicit approach ??? particularly in terms of its emphasis on collective responsibility and social context (in addition to individual responsibility), and its emphasis on moral arguments for individuals and collectives to accept responsibility and hold themselves accountable by contributing to future change. This ambitious and complex approach raised some important theoretical issues, which have been discussed and debated in the theoretical literature. These include: the relationship between individual responsibility, collective responsibility and the influence of ???the system???; the nature of collective responsibility; the nature of morality; the distinction between moral and political responsibility; and how individuals and collectives can or should be held accountable. In South Africa, these theoretical debates inter-mingled with a range of other factors, including individual and collective interests, motives and political perspectives. From an analysis of the existing literature on the TRC and original interviews conducted with key informants, I draw out three main opposing views which I argue arose in the South African social context about responsibility and accountability, and what the TRC could and should have done to address these. In a detailed analysis of the TRC???s hearings and Final Report, I draw out how theoretical debates, and these three opposing views, were present within and impacted on the TRC???s work. I argue that it was impossible for the TRC to satisfy everyone and resolve these debates, and that its approach led to unrealistic expectations of its work and its role more generally. This has impacted negatively on how the TRC was and is perceived.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pictures and page numbers - image, text and formal structure in the visual book and the artist's book</field><field name="creator">Douglas, James Maxwell, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Within the realm of artists' book works there are few that could not be said to display a fundamental concern with the physicality of the book. The mechanics of page turning are integrally implied in any artist's decision to utilise the book form. Indeed, artists' books emphasise the ability of book forms, and of text and language, to acquire meaning through form and structure alone. The physical and conceptual mechanics, or syntax, of the book - whose basis lies as much in the formal, functional dictates of the book's material characteristics, as in centuries of entrenched tradition in page layout and book design - affords a spatial, sculptural and temporal framework whose manipulation may be effortlessly and subconsciously 'read' by the viewer, according to their inherent understanding and appreciation of the form's conceptual function and operation. But while the structural connotations of the book suggest that special kind of decipherment known as 'reading', the broader associations of the book's mythic, iconic and historic symbolism may be equally unavoidable. The book works comprising the research that this paper accompanies therefore aim, on the one hand, to explore the formal, structural physicality and spatiality of the book as both a self-contained sculptural platform and as a particular sort of collection, or series, of visual imagery, while on the other hand, seeking to address the psychological form of the book as an iconic, symbolic object, and to simulate something of the character of the unique, precious and mythic books of the past. Thus it has been an attempt to deal with abstract notions of pattern and structure, as well as with the mental frameworks of association and connotation surrounding the visual modes adopted to represent these structures. The project presents an integrated and interrelated series of unique, hand-made book works that are about books - or perhaps a particular kind of 'bookishness' - a collection which aims to be physically very real, but at the same time completely mythical, and in whose volumes the common conceptual and aesthetic reference is the inherent, traditional austerity of the book page, and the simultaneous conceptual movement and structural dynamics of the mechanical book form.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">books</field><field name="subject">artist's books</field><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="subject">formal structure</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I came, I saw, I ???? Contemporary Australian representations that return the tourist gaze</field><field name="creator">Vogler, Agnes, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis adopts post-colonial theory as a reading strategy to address both fiction and interdisciplinary critical writing on the subject of tourism. The introduction argues for the viability of this methodology, highlighting similarities between the ideological underpinnings of tourism and imperialism, especially in relation to the power of the gaze. The first chapter draws on analyses of early exploration and travel writing to advance the argument that as the ideology of empire was encoded in travel writing, so contemporary tourist culture, in so far as it has inherited this discourse, continues to operate within it. I suggest that in much the same way as the explorer???s gaze was a form of creating knowledge disseminated through writing, fiction constitutes a cultural production that contests the power of the gaze. The second chapter focuses on the ambivalent effects of the commodification of culture caused by the tourist industry. I argue that cultural tourism, centred on heritage and history, has constituted a platform from which to review conventional representations of Australian history in a way that demonstrates the relevance of heritage to contemporary national narratives. The third and final chapter examines the relationship between cultural performances in tourism and subject formation, contending that the repetitive nature of performance offers an ideal opportunity to interpolate transformative views of both locals and tourists into the conventional tourist discourse.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23948</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Achromatic and chromatic VEPs in adults with down syndrome</field><field name="creator">Lloyd, Robyn, School of Optometry &amp; Visual Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Previous studies have found that spatial processing in children and adults with Down syndrome is different in comparison to the normal population. Some previous studies have also found that there is a high prevalence of colour vision deficiencies in people with Down syndrome. The aim of the present study was to use an objective test, the transient visual evoked potential (VEP), to assess achromatic and chromatic visual processing in adults with Down syndrome. Achromatic VEPs were recorded in response to black-white stimuli presented in patternreversal mode. Chromatic VEPs were recorded in response to two types of colour pattern, presented in pattern onset-offset mode. The two colour types were intended to preferentially stimulate the two principal chromatic pathways of the visual system, the ???redgreen??? and ???blue-yellow??? colour-opponent pathways. These stimuli are here termed the ???LM??? and ???S-(L+M) stimuli, respectively, reflecting the cone types that input to the pathways they are intended to stimulate. Each subject also completed two subjective colour vision tests, the Colour Vision Test Made Easy (CVTME) and the City University Colour Vision Test (CUT). Morphology of the achromatic and chromatic VEPs was found to differ between the group with Down syndrome and an age-matched control group. The latency of the P100 component of the achromatic VEP was found to be significantly later in the group with Down syndrome compared to the control group (the N75 latency was earlier in the group with Down syndrome, but not significantly so). The group-averaged peak-to-peak amplitude of the achromatic VEP was significantly lower in the group with Down syndrome compared to the control group. The major positive component of the VEP in response to the L-M stimulus was of significantly longer latency compared to that of the control group. The major negative component and the peak-to-peak amplitude of this response were not significantly different between the groups. For the response to S-(L+M) stimuli, the latency of the major negativity was significantly earlier in the group with Down syndrome and the major positivity was later, but not significantly so. Amplitude of this response was significantly higher in adults with Down syndrome compared to the control group. Most subjects in both groups passed both the CVTME and CUT. Our findings indicate that chromatic VEPs are abnormal in Down syndrome, and this may reflect abnormal processing of chromatic stimuli in this population. Alternatively, these abnormalities may arise due to abnormal cortical morphology, which may occur with normal or abnormal processing of chromatic signals. These findings further indicate that abnormality of chromatic VEPs may be expected in Down syndrome, and is not necessarily indicative of pathology or other abnormal function that is unrelated to the syndrome.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visual evoked response</field><field name="subject">Optics</field><field name="subject">Down syndrome</field><field name="subject">Evoked potentials, Visual</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational model of epirentinal stimulation</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Jia, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The quality of visual perception with epiretinal electric stimulation strongly depends on the configuration of electrode arrays. Such arrays at the surface of the retina should excite only cells within a local area, but in practice, they exhibit some cross-talk, possibly leading to a smearing of focal activation of the retina. In this study, a passive model of extracellular voltage distribution arising from epiretinal stimulation is solved using the method of finite differences, in order to explore the voltage and current distributions of a hexagonal electrode array configuration. Results of this study suggest that the hexagonal electrode arrangement is effective in providing targeted focal activation of retinal tissue. Cross-talk between hexagonal clusters may be minimized by stimulus paradigms which utilize six return (or guard) electrodes around each stimulus electrode.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Targeted alpha-therapy:cell survival determination in melanoma tumours using Monte Carlo calculations.</field><field name="creator">Pashaeinejad, Masoumeh, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study investigates the Monte Carlo calculations of cell survival in metastatic subcutaneous melanoma cancer tumours. To achieve this goal, a Monte Carlo program called SLAB.FOR was developed by Prof. David Charlton. The program randomly places alphas from 213Bi in the medium, which is a cancer cell sized micro dosimeter with a SiO2 converter on the top and Si as the sensitive volume. Then the Monte Carlo program calculates the energy deposited by alphas and their chord length and also the dose deposited in the sensitive volume. To be able to use this program, some information was taken from phase one of a clinical trial conducted by the Centre of Experimental Radiation Oncology (CERO) in 2001. During the course of this study the administered activities on tumours with different diameters are determined. Using this information the number of alpha particles going through each m3 of the tumour was found. Based on this number, the program SLAB.FOR was run for different administered activities in the tumours. The output of the program yielded the energy deposited and the number of hits by the alpha particles as they go through the tumours. The output data was also used to calculate the cell survival values, energy and hit distribution probabilities. The cell survival values were then used to plot the cell survival curves. They were plotted against dose, number of hits and injected activity per volume of the tumours. These data were also used to plot the energy and hit distribution probability curves. Our results show that survival is dependent on the diameter of the cell and decreases when the dose deposited in the tumour increases. The survival also has a relationship with the number of hits that a cell receives and it also depends on the injected activity to the volume. The survival decreases as the number of hits and injected activity increases. Our results confirmed what was stated in the clinical trial conducted by the Centre of Experimental Radiation Oncology (CERO) in 2001.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radiationtherapy</field><field name="subject">targeted alpha therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23996</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A proposed security protocol for data gathering mobile agents</field><field name="creator">Al-Jaljouli, Raja, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">We address the security issue of the data which mobile agents gather as they are traversing the Internet.

So the existing protocols are not truly secure. We present an accurate security protocol which aims to assert strong integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of the gathered data. The proposed protocol is derived from the Multi-hops protocol. The protocol suffers from security flaws, e.g. an adversary might truncate/ replace collected data, or sign others data with its own private key without being detected. The proposed protocol refines the Multi-hops protocol by implementing the following security techniques: utilization of co-operating agents, scrambling the gathered offers, requesting a visited host to clear its memory from any data acquired as a result of executing the agent before the host dispatches the agent to the succeeding host in the agent???s itinerary, and carrying out verifications on the identity of the genuine initiator at the early execution of the agent at visited hosts, in addition to the verifications upon the agent???s return to the initiator. The proposed protocol also implements the common security techniques such as public key encryption, digital signature, etc. The implemented security techniques would rectify the security flaws revealed in the existing protocols. We use STA, an infinite-state exploration tool, to verify the security properties of a reasonably small instance of the proposed protocol in key configurations. The analysis using STA reports no attack. Moreover, we carefully reason the correctness of the security protocol for a general model and show that the protocol would be capable of preventing or at least detecting the attacks revealed in the existing protocols.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile agents</field><field name="subject">security protocol</field><field name="subject">formal methds</field><field name="subject">information security</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23999</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inheritance and expectations: the ambivalence of the colonial orphan figure in post-colonial re-writings of Charles Dickens???s Great Expectations.</field><field name="creator">Sugano, Motoko, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the colonial literary relationship between the ???centre??? and the ???margin??? in the field of post-colonial counter-discourse. As such, this thesis investigates the possibility of disrupting the dominance of Empire, which is often rhetorically constructed through the certainty of the parent and child binary relationship. By analysing the orphan???s affiliational associations, which exist beyond the traditional binary of parent and child in the colonial relationship, I argue that the orphan, as both figure and trope, becomes a site of resistance to the dominant colonial discourse. Re-reading Charles Dickens???s Great Expectations with two Australian re-writings of his text in mind ??? Peter Carey???s Jack Maggs and Gail Jones???s Sixty Lights ??? this thesis investigates the particular case of post-colonial counter-discursive practice, and explores the way in which the orphan figure in each re-writing inscribes their expectations and thereby refigures the power hierarchy between the canonical European text and the post-colonial re-writing. In order to do so, I have organised this thesis into four main chapters, each of which develops a specific interrogation of the orphan figure in light of post-colonial theory and criticism. So, chapter one considers the colonial figure and the trope of parent and child, investigating the influence that this trope wields in casting the racialised colonial Other as ???savage??? and ???primitive???, but, ultimately, ???child-like???. Chapter two furthers this observation by highlighting the disruptive affect of such naturalised perspectives of the colonial Other???evidenced in post-colonial theory through the motion of the key concepts of ambivalence and abjection. And, it is in this context that chapters three and four stand as direct examinations of the disruptive affect of the orphan figure. Discussing Peter Carey???s Jack Maggs and Gail Jones???s Sixty Lights (respectively), these last two chapters formalise the subversive agency assumed by the orphan, and locate it in the very practice of ???writing back to the centre???.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Journey</field><field name="creator">Li, Wenmin, School of Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">???Journey??? as a term in the dictionary, indicates a distance covered in travelling, usually by land, from one place to another.

At the macro level the reform is to transition to a market economy and at the micro level, business enterprises are adopting sound standards of corporate governance. This thesis analyses the various models: the shareholder value, the stakeholder, the stewardship and the convergence models of corporate governance. It looks at the Chinese scenario - what model of governance has China adopted and is it appropriate? What problems of corporate governance are special to China and how are these problems being resolved? Many of the problems are due to the fact that China has adopted the shareholder value model ??? a model based on the UK / USA. However, unlike them, China does not posses the requisite institutions necessary to underpin the efficient functioning of the model. The Chinese capital markets are nascent and not well regulated, the rule of law is tentative and the regulatory bodies are lacking in enforcement powers. In an effort to encourage good corporate governance, the China Securities Regulatory Commission promulgated the QFII (Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor) scheme in December 2002 in the hope that by opening the domestic securities market to foreign financial institutions, this would result in the implementation of sound corporate governance in Chinese listed companies as they vied to attract foreign shareholders. A survey was carried out and the results have only been mildly encouraging. The QFII has not had the dramatic impact that was expected of it initially and the reason is that the quotas allocated have been small and the QFII have had many restrictions placed. Until these are loosened the impact of the QFII will continue to be modest.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate governance - China</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selective disassembly for re-use of industrial products</field><field name="creator">Pornprasitpol, Pornwan, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">As a result of rapid product development, the product life cycle has become shorter, and thus the amount of waste from discarded industrial products has risen dramatically. An awareness of the world???s environmental problems has stimulated researchers to explore the opportunities to reuse, recycle and remanufacture end-of-life products. Disassembly is a systematic approach to separating products into components or subassemblies in order to facilitate recovery of components or materials. However, the full disassembly of a product tends to be unproductive due to technical and cost constraints and product conditions after usage. Therefore, selective disassembly has been introduced as a more practical approach, where only a limited number of disassembly paths that lead to selected parts with recovering potential are considered. This research focuses on the development of a selective disassembly methodology by reversing an assembly sequencing approach. The methodology uses a step-by-step approach to generate a disassembly sequence diagram. This involves listing all the parts within the product, generating a liaison diagram to illustrate part relationships and then establishing precedence rules describing prerequisite actions for each liaison. This is followed by segregating disassembly paths that lead to the removal of selected parts or subassemblies. Then a winnowing process is applied to these paths to eliminate invalid disassembly states and transitions. The last step is to select the optimal disassembly path by using the time requirement as the main selection criterion. In order to shorten the time for carrying out the sequencing process, a javabased program that is capable of performing the first three steps has been created. The program requires three basic inputs in forms of precedence rules, and user-required part (s) and disassembly rules, prescribing which liaison (s) should be done subsequent to a particular liaison. The viability of the methodology and the program is proved through seven case studies conducted on a fishing reel, a single-hole punch, a kettle, an entire washing machine and three washing machine subassemblies. The application of the program allows the users to determine an optimal disassembly sequence in a very short time and with only basic product information as the input.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Recycling (Waste, etc.)</field><field name="subject">Production engineering - Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Industrial management - Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Product life cycle - Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Environmental protection - Economic aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coal related bed material agglomeration in pressurized fluidized bed combustion.</field><field name="creator">Xu, Jiangang, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thermodynamic behaviours in a PFBC combustor were simulated for the ash from all of the six coals with sand and limestone as bed material. Ash components determined the ash thermodynamic behaviour at high temperature, and each component had different effects. For assessment of the potential for bed material agglomeration, the temperature at which 15% of the ash would become liquid (T15) was calculated with the coal ash, the cyclone ash and the cyclone ash mixed with varying amounts of limestone. Both the bed ash and fly ash, collected from an industrial PFBC plant, consisted of limestone/lime particles with different extent of sulphation, and coal ash particles. The calcium aluminosilicate material formed on the coal ash particles but not on the limestone particles. The aluminosilicate materials appeared to be formed from fine ash and lime particles at some local hot zones in the boiler. The melted materials may glue ash and bed material particle into large particles leading to bed agglomeration and defluidization. Four mechanisms were proposed for the formation of bed material agglomeration in PFBC, which may occur under different conditions. One mechanism explains the bed material agglomeration with the high localized high temperature zone due to the improper design or operation, while the bed agglomeration through the other three mechanisms results from the unsuitable coals burnt in the PFBC combustor. The maximum char temperature and the minimum T15 were used simultaneously to predict the tendency towards bed material agglomeration in PFBC burning different coals. Both char properties and ash properties should be considered during coal selection process for PFBC, to ameliorate the potential problem of bed agglomeration.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fluidized-bed combustion</field><field name="subject">Coal-fired power plants</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimizing life-cycle maintenance cost of complex machinery using advanced statistical techniques and simulation.</field><field name="creator">El Hayek, Mustapha, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Maintenance is constantly challenged with increasing productivity by maximizing up-time and reliability while at the same time reducing expenditure and investment. In the last few years it has become evident through the development of maintenance concepts that maintenance is more than just a non-productive support function, it is a profit- generating function. In the past decades, hundreds of models that address maintenance strategy have been presented. The vast majority of those models rely purely on mathematical modeling to describe the maintenance function. Due to the complex nature of the maintenance function, and its complex interaction with other functions, it is almost impossible to accurately model maintenance using mathematical modeling without sacrificing accuracy and validity with unfeasible simplifications and assumptions. Analysis presented as part of this thesis shows that stochastic simulation offers a viable alternative and a powerful technique for tackling maintenance problems. Stochastic simulation is a method of modeling a system or process (on a computer) based on random events generated by the software so that system performance can be evaluated without experimenting or interfering with the actual system. The methodology developed as part of this thesis addresses most of the shortcomings found in literature, specifically by allowing the modeling of most of the complexities of an advanced maintenance system, such as one that is employed in the airline industry. This technique also allows sensitivity analysis to be carried out resulting in an understanding of how critical variables may affect the maintenance and asset management decision-making process. In many heavy industries (e.g. airline maintenance) where high utilization is essential for the success of the organization, subsystems are often of a rotable nature, i.e. they rotate among different systems throughout their life-cycle. This causes a system to be composed of a number of subsystems of different ages, and therefore different reliability characteristics. This makes it difficult for analysts to estimate its reliability behavior, and therefore may result in a less-than-optimal maintenance plan. Traditional reliability models are based on detailed statistical analysis of individual component failures. For complex machinery, especially involving many rotable parts, such analyses are difficult and time consuming. In this work, a model is proposed that combines the well-established Weibull method with discrete simulation to estimate the reliability of complex machinery with rotable subsystems or modules. Each module is characterized by an empirically derived failure distribution. The simulation model consists of a number of stages including operational up-time, maintenance down-time and a user-interface allowing decisions on maintenance and replacement strategies as well as inventory levels and logistics. This enables the optimization of a maintenance plan by comparing different maintenance and removal policies using the Cost per Unit Time (CPUT) measure as the decision variable. Five different removal strategies were tested. These include: On-failure replacements, block replacements, time-based replacements, condition-based replacements and a combination of time-based and condition-based strategies. Initial analyses performed on aircraft gas-turbine data yielded an optimal combination of modules out of a pool of multiple spares, resulting in an increased machine up-time of 16%. In addition, it was shown that condition-based replacement is a cost-effective strategy; however, it was noted that the combination of time and condition-based strategy can produce slightly better results. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed to optimize decision variables (module soft-time), and to provide an insight to the level of accuracy with which it has to be estimated. It is imperative as part of the overall reliability and life-cycle cost program to focus not only on reducing levels of unplanned (i.e. breakdown) maintenance through preventive and predictive maintenance tasks, but also optimizing inventory of spare parts management, sometimes called float hardware. It is well known that the unavailability of a spare part may result in loss of revenue, which is associated with an increase in system downtime. On the other hand increasing the number of spares will lead to an increase in capital investment and holding cost. The results obtained from the simulation model were used in a discounted NPV (Net Present Value) analysis to determine the optimal number of spare engines. The benefits of this methodology are that it is capable of providing reliability trends and forecasts in a short time frame and based on available data. In addition, it takes into account the rotable nature of many components by tracking the life and service history of individual parts and allowing the user to simulate different combinations of rotables, operating scenarios, and replacement strategies. It is also capable of optimizing stock and spares levels as well as other related key parameters like the average waiting time, unavailability cost, and the number of maintenance events that result in extensive durations due to the unavailability of spare parts. Importantly, as more data becomes available or as greater accuracy is demanded, the model or database can be updated or expanded, thereby approaching the results obtainable by pure statistical reliability analysis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Machinery - Maintenance and repair</field><field name="subject">Engineering - Statistical methods</field><field name="subject">Service life (Engineering)</field><field name="subject">Life cycle costing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Delineating the source, geochemical sinks and aqueous mobilisation processes of naturally occurring arsenic in a coastal sandy aquifer</field><field name="creator">O???Shea, Bethany Megan, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Elevated arsenic concentrations have been reported in a drinking water and irrigation-supply aquifer of Stuarts Point, New South Wales, Australia. Arsenic occurrence in such aquifers is potentially a major issue due to their common use for high yield domestic and irrigation water supplies. Ten multi-level piezometers were installed to depths of approximately 30 m in the sand and clay aquifer. Sediment samples were collected at specific depths during drilling and analysed for chemical and mineralogical composition, grain size characteristics, potential for arsenic release from solid phase and detailed microscopic features. From this data, a full geomorphic reconstruction allowed the determination of source provenance for the aquifer sediments. The model proposed herein provides evidence that the bulk of the aquifer was deposited under intermittent fluvial and estuarine conditions; and that all sediments derive from the regional arsenicmineralised hinterland. More than 200 groundwater samples were collected and analysed for over 50 variables. The heterogeneity of the aquifer sediments causes redox stratification to occur, which in turn governs arsenic mobility in the groundwater. The bulk of the aquifer is composed of fluvial sand deposits undergoing reductive dissolution of iron oxides. Arsenic adsorbed to iron oxide minerals is released during dissolution but re-adsorbs to other iron oxides present in this part of the aquifer. The deeper, more reducing fluvial sand and estuarine clay groundwaters have undergone complete reductive dissolution of iron oxides resulting in the subsequent mobilisation of arsenic into groundwater. Some of this arsenic has been incorporated into iron sulfide mineral precipitates, forming current arsenian pyrite sinks within the aquifer. The extraction of groundwater from the aquifer for irrigation and drinking water supply induces seawater intrusion of arsenic-rich estuarine water, bringing further dissolved arsenic into the aquifer. A greater understanding of the source, sinks and mobilisation of arsenic in this aquifer contributes to our broad understanding of arsenic in the environment; and allows aquifer specific management procedures and research recommendations to be made. Any coastal or unconsolidated aquifer that has sediments derived from mineralised provenances should consider monitoring for arsenic, and other potentially toxic trace elements, in their groundwater systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquifers - New South Wales - Kempsey</field><field name="subject">Groundwater - New South Wales - Kempsey</field><field name="subject">Arsenic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25179</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The locus and source of verbal associations</field><field name="creator">Lazendic, Goran, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this dissertation an attempt was made to uncover the source of verbal associations. The investigation focused on establishing the locus of representation for associative relationships in the cognitive system and whether this locus is different from that for semantic relationships. A picture naming task and an object decision task were used within the standard priming paradigm, in which the target is preceded by a prime. A dual-level model was proposed in which associative relatedness is represented at a lemma level that connects the lexical form representation of a word to its semantic information. According to this model an interaction between associative and categorical relatedness should occur in picture naming, but not in object decision, when primes and targets share both relationships, and this is what was observed. To investigate the mechanisms of associative priming, asymmetrically associated prime-target pairs were used to create two situations. In the forward priming condition the target was an associate of the prime (e.g., brick-house), and in the backward priming condition the prime was an associate of the target (e.g., babyrattle). Unexpectedly, facilitation was observed for backward priming at the short SOA in picture naming. Because no effect was observed for this condition in the object decision task, and given that forward priming produced facilitation in both tasks spreading activation was upheld as the mechanism for associative priming. In order to investigate whether the source of the relationship between associates might be in their latent semantic content, the impact of instrument relationships (e.g., grinder-coffee), script relationships (e.g., zoo-tiger), and proximity in multidimensional semantic space were also investigated in the picture naming task. Items that were close in semantic space, but did not share any semantic relationships, produced the same priming pattern as category co-ordinates in picture naming (i.e., interference), while instrumental and script relationships did not produce a priming pattern that matched either that observed for associative or categorical relatedness. These results were taken to indicate that the source of associative relationships is in the co-occurrence of words in the language, which further supported the main claim of a dual-level model where information about verbal associations is stored outside semantic memory.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Association of ideas</field><field name="subject">Semantics (Philosophy)</field><field name="subject">Information theory</field><field name="subject">Memory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and valuing multivariate interdependencies in financial time series</field><field name="creator">Milunovich, George, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates implications of interdependence between stock market prices in the context of several financial applications including: portfolio selection, tests of market efficiency and measuring the extent of integration among national stock markets.

The growth has fueled the realization of many peer-to-peer networks in both academia and the commercial arena. Peer-to-peer networks generally fall into one of these categories ??? centralized systems with server-like entities in the network; unstructured systems with random topology and message routing, and structured systems with deterministic topology and routing behavior. Surveying the major peer-to-peer networks in each category, one can conclude that the each of the categories exhibit very different characteristics and properties from one another. This thesis addresses the problems in the peer-to-peer networking space by employing two overarching principles. Firstly, desirable properties of systems in one category can be adopted by another to achieve restructuring. In short, restructuring involves the injection of structure into unstructured networks and conversely loosening the rigidity in structured systems. Secondly, as much as possible, participating peers in the network are designed to be homogeneous in functionality recognizing that they are heterogeneous in capabilities. True to the concept of the peer-to-peer paradigm, this principle keeps participants functioning as fellow peers rather than imposing hierarchical differences in the roles within the network. We describe three contexts in which the issues pertaining to the peer-to-peer networks in view can be addressed by applying the principle of restructuring. For the Mobile Agent Peer-to-Peer architecture, we adopt centralized concepts into the unstructured peer-to-peer network while maintaining homogeneity in functionality through the use of mobile agents. The architecture shields excessive traffic from peers with limited resources and allows more capable peers to share others??? burden. Through the use of mobile agents, logical hierarchy is avoided and thus the second overarching principle of homogeneity is preserved. For Gnutella Clusters, concepts from the structured systems are adopted to facilitate the formation and maintenance of clustering in unstructured networks. Clustering limits the amount of flooding in the network and thus conserves bandwith. The clustering algorithm is decentralized to all peers, and does not need a set of participants to have special functionality ??? thus preserving the generic nature of all peers. In Autonomic Decentralized Service Directory platform, structure is released from the underlying Chord network to provide better support for service registration and searching. The strict requirements for deterministic routing and lookup which characterize structured systems are granted some leniency for the ability to avoid misbehaving nodes and provide incentives for peers to behave properly.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Interpersonal communication</field><field name="subject">Business networks</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The covariation of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and anxiety in children: a community sample</field><field name="creator">Baldwin, Jennifer S., Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is comorbid with a range of other disorders in clinical and community samples, including anxiety disorders. The outcomes of the Multimodal Treatment Studies of ADHD (MTA Cooperative Group, 1999) highlight the importance of this comorbidity, as children with anxiety responded differently to treatments than did children with ADHD only. At present there are few tested theoretical explanations of the etiological processes and developmental trajectories associated with their co-occurrence. The aim of this research was to put forward and examine different explanations for the comorbidity of these two disorders in children according to the framework provided by Lilienfeld (2003). This was achieved by examining the covariation of ADHD symptoms and anxiety symptoms in a community sample of 499 children aged 8-13. Dimensional assessments of psychopathology were conducted via self-report questionnaires given to children, parents and teachers. The results were analysed via structural equation modelling approaches using AMOS (Arbuckle, 2003). Consistent with the hypotheses, positive associations at Time 1 between ADHD and anxiety symptoms were linked with inattention symptoms and were particularly pronounced for girls. The concurrent positive associations observed at each time period could not be completely accounted for by overlapping symptoms across measures or by method covariance explanations. The link between ADHD and anxiety symptoms could be explained by a common factor in reporting whereby ADHD and anxiety symptoms were both associated with noncompliance and negative affect for parents' reports, and negative affect for children???s' reports. Despite the concurrent associations, there was no support for the hypothesis that ADHD symptoms predicted the development of anxiety  symptoms over time, nor the alternative hypothesis that anxiety symptoms predicted the development of ADHD symptoms over time, when the stability of symptoms across time was taken into account. It was concluded that ADHD symptoms (particularly inattention) and anxiety symptoms are covarying phenomena that are linked with common features of an irritable temperament and disruptive behaviour. Future research should investigate the role of these common factors in treatment outcome and cognitive research, which has previously found differences between ADHD children with and without anxiety.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder</field><field name="subject">Anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">Comorbidity</field><field name="subject">Child psychopathology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of secondary schools in the development of student knowledge about poverty in Australia, The Philippines and Zimbabwe</field><field name="creator">Burgis, Paul Lindsay, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examined student knowledge about the nature, scope, causes and responses to poverty, student perceptions of the emphasis in the school curricula on poverty and development, student attitudes to poverty and the factors that influence such knowledge and attitudes. Knowledge and attitudes at the end of primary school were compared with those after four years of secondary school in three nations, Australia. The Philippines and Zimbabwe, involving 1296 surveys and 188 interviews. The investigation draws on earlier work in Ireland (Regan, 1996). and is a response to the recent emphasis on the role of schools in development education in Europe (Lemmers, 2001) and the call for a greater emphasis in Australia on this area (Simons. Hart and WTalsh, 1997). The survey compared student understanding with current 'knowledge' in the literature and the interview allowed an examination of the stories students constructed about people in poverty, including their cognitive and affective responses to people in poverty. Results showed that whilst almost all students recognised that poverty exists, they were more likely to define it simply as a lack of income than as a phenomenon involving social power and self esteem. Few students were aware that the majority of the world's poor are female. Nationality was an important predictor of student knowledge and values. Australian students considered nationally based causes (e.g., government, education) to be more important than personal qualities (e.g., laziness) or international causes (e.g., powerful countries). Australian students were also more likely to value hedonism, but it could not be demonstrated conclusively that this affected the ways that they defined poverty and its causes. Filipino students were more likely to perceive poverty as being the fault of the person experiencing poverty and were more pejorative towards the poor.  Whilst Filipino and Zimbabwean students considered that they had learnt a lot about poverty, few Australian students thought this to be the case. Students in senior secondary school were not well informed of current understandings about poverty and development and did not possess a significantly greater knowledge than primary school students on these matters. Specifically. current school practices allow students to perceive poverty as primarily income related and do not place due emphasis on internationally related causes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Poverty - Study and teaching (Secondary)</field><field name="subject">High schools - Australia</field><field name="subject">High schools - Zimbabwe</field><field name="subject">High schools - Philippines</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25483</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Summarization of very large spatial dataset</field><field name="creator">Liu, Qing, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Nowadays there are a large number of applications, such as digital library information retrieval, business data analysis, CAD/CAM, multimedia applications with images and sound, real-time process control and scientific computation, with data sets about gigabytes, terabytes or even petabytes. Because data distributions are too large to be stored accurately, maintaining compact and accurate summarized information about underlying data is of crucial important.  The summarizing problem for Level 1 (disjoint and non-disjoint) topological relationship has been well studied for the past few years. However the spatial database users are often interested in a much richer set of spatial relations such as contains. Little work has been done on summarization for Level 2 topological relationship which includes contains, contained, overlap, equal and disjoint relations.  We study the problem of effective summatization to represent the underlying data distribution to answer window queries for Level 2 topological relationship. Cell-density based approach has been demonstrated as an effective way to this problem. But the challenges are the accuracy of the results and the storage space required which should be linearly proportional to the number of cells to be practical.  In this thesis, we present several novel techniques to effectively construct cell density based spatial histograms. Based on the framework proposed, exact results could be obtained in constant time for aligned window queries. To minimize the storage space of the framework, an approximate algorithm with the approximate ratio 19/12 is presented, while the problem is shown NP-hard generally. Because the framework requires only a storage space linearly proportional to the number of cells, it is practical for many popular real datasets. To conform to a limited storage space, effective histogram construction and query algorithms are proposed which can provide approximate results but with high accuracy. The problem for non-aligned window queries is also investigated and techniques of un-even partitioned space are developed to support non-aligned window queries. Finally, we extend our techniques to 3D space. Our extensive experiments against both synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithms developed in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">summarization</field><field name="subject">spatial database</field><field name="subject">histogram</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25489</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dynamic network model for imbibition and film flow</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Viet Hoai, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a new dynamic network model for imbibition which is based on a physically realistic description of the complex dynamics of corner film flow, swelling and snap-off. The model shows that film flow is a capillary driven non-linear diffusive process and that the competition between snapoff and frontal displacements is rate dependent and results in rate dependent relative permeabilities and residual saturations. In contrast to previously published models in which length scales for snap-off are either specified a priori or calculated assuming steady-state film flow and constant film conductivities, in the present model, snap-off arises as a natural consequence of the fully transient nature of film flow and swelling.  The network model is used to analyse the complex interaction between displacement rate, contact angle, aspect ratio and pore and throat shape on relative permeability and residual saturation. Computed relative permeabilities and residual saturations are compared with laboratory measurements reported in the literature. It is concluded that the magnitude of the rate effect on imbibition relative permeabilities and residual saturations for a particular rock microstructure and wettability condition depends largely on the pore-throat aspect ratio. Higher aspect ratios result in stronger rate effects than do smaller aspect ratios.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flow in porous media</field><field name="subject">network model</field><field name="subject">imbibition</field><field name="subject">rate effects</field><field name="subject">capillary number</field><field name="subject">Berea</field><field name="subject">sandstone</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25495</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading the writings of contemporary Indonesian Muslim women writers: representation, identity and religion of Muslim women in Indonesian fictions</field><field name="creator">Arimbi, Diah Ariani, Women's &amp; Gender Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">Indonesian Muslim women???s identity and subjectivity are not created simply from a single variable rather they are shaped by various discourses that are often competing and paralleling each other. Discourses such as patriarchal discourses circumscribing the social engagement and public life of Muslim women portray them in narrow gendered parameters in which women occupy rather limited public roles. Western colonial discourse often constructed Muslim women as oppressed and backward. Each such discourse indeed denies women???s agency and maturity to form their own definition of identity within the broad Islamic parameters. Rewriting women???s own identities are articulated in various forms from writing to visualisation, from fiction to non fiction. All expressions signify women???s ways to react against the silencing and muteness that have long imposed upon women???s agency.  In Indonesian literary culture today, numerous women writers have represented in their writings women???s own ways to look at their own selves.  Literary representations become one group among others trying to portray women???s strategies that will give them maximum control over their lives and bodies.  Muslim women writers in Indonesia have shown through their representations of Muslim women in their writings that Muslim women in Indonesian settings are capable of undergoing a self-definition process. However, from their writings too, readers are reminded that although most women portrayed are strong and assertive it does not necessarily mean that they are free of oppression. The thesis is about Muslim women and gender-related issues in Indonesia. It focuses on the writings of four contemporary Indonesian Muslim women writers: Titis Basino P I, Ratna Indraswari Ibrahim, Abidah El Kalieqy and Helvy Tiana Rosa, primarily looking at how gender is constructed and in turn constructs the identity, roles and status of Musim women in Indonesia and how such relations are portrayed, covering issues of authenticity, representation and power inextricably intertwined in a variety of aesthetic forms and narrative structures.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Muslims</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">feminists</field><field name="subject">Indonesian</field><field name="subject">writings</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Culture, risk, and vulnerability to blood-borne viruses among ethnic Vietnamese injecting drug users</field><field name="creator">Ho, Hien Thi, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">There is increasing concern about hepatitis C virus (HCV) and potential HIV transmission among ethnic Vietnamese injecting drug users (IDUs) in Australia. To date ethnic and cultural differences in vulnerability to blood-borne viruses (BBV) have received little attention and few studies have attempted to explore the role of cultural beliefs and values in influencing injection risk behaviour. This study aimed to systematically explore the cultural beliefs and behavioural practices that appear to place ethnic Vietnamese IDUs at increased risk of BBV infection, identify barriers to this group accessing health and preventive programs, and document antibody HIV and HCV prevalence and associated risk behaviours. The first component of the research consisted of an ethnographic study designed to explore underlying explanatory models of health and illness employed by Vietnamese IDUs and identify cultural influences on risk behaviours and vulnerability to BBVs. These data were subsequently used to inform the development of the instrument used in the second component ??? a cross-sectional survey and collection of capillary blood samples designed to assess risk behaviours and antibody HIV and antibody HCV prevalence. Analysis of data from both components indicates that cultural beliefs and practices influence risk-taking and health-seeking behaviours and suggests pathways through which this influence occurs. Relevant cultural characteristics include those pertaining to spiritual and religious beliefs, the role of the family and traditional Vietnamese family values, cultural scripts of self-control and stoicism, the importance of ???face??? and non-confrontational relationships, trust and obligation, and a reluctance to discuss problems with outsiders. Vulnerability to BBVs is influenced by these cultural characteristics, together with Vietnamese IDUs??? perceptions of risk, knowledge about HIV and HCV, and situational and environmental factors. Main factors contributing to the under-utilisation of health services include the use of self-managed care practices, ambivalence surrounding Western medicine, long waiting times, concerns in relation to confidentiality, stigmatisation of drug use, and limited knowledge of BBVs. The data indicate a need for interventions based on understanding of culturally specific meanings and contexts of health, illness and risk in order to better meet the needs of this vulnerable group.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cultural characteristics</field><field name="subject">cultural influences</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">risk factors</field><field name="subject">injecting drug use</field><field name="subject">hepatitis C</field><field name="subject">HIV</field><field name="subject">overdose</field><field name="subject">traditional medicine</field><field name="subject">health services accessibility</field><field name="subject">prevalence</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Terrestial mobile user positioning using TDOA and fingerprinting techniques</field><field name="creator">Li, Binghao, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Specialists are expecting the knowledge of location will trigger yet another revolution in mobile services. Location-base services (LBS) have attracted many researchers and enterprises and one of the key aspects of LBS is positioning technology. Considering a wider and more complex field - ubiquitous computing, location is the fundamental element. This work focuses on some aspects of the new techniques of terrestrial positioning systems.  Wireless LAN is one of the most popular systems used for positioning for indoor environments and public places. We have investigated the trilateration and fingerprinting approaches and the results showed the advantages of fingerprinting. A novel method to generate the fingerprints database based on Universal Kriging (UK) was developed, which can not only significantly decrease the training time, but also increase the accuracy of estimates.  In mobile phone positioning systems, most techniques suffer from the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation. We investigated the specifics of NLOS error, and proposed a method to mitigate the errors. Furthermore, a new algorithm named WSMM (wireless signal map matching) was discussed. Simulations and experiments verified the idea, and the accuracy of positioning can be improved greatly. Since fingerprinting technique can utilize rather than suffer from the NLOS propagation, it was also applied in mobile phone positioning system. Experiments showed both the deterministic approach and probabilistic approach can provide better results comparing with other techniques in suburban area.  To achieve a robust positioning system and provide more useful information of the user, multisensor combination and data fusion are necessary. As the first step of future research, a mulitsensor synchronization system was developed. This system can promisingly achieve synchronization with error less than 0.4 ms, which is suitable for most land applications.  Hence the main findings of this thesis are: (1) a novel method of yielding fingerprint database for both wireless LAN (WLAN) and mobile phone systems when using the fingerprinting technique for positioning; (2) a database method to mitigate NLOS error for mobile phone positioning systems; (3) a low cost synchronization system for integration of multiple sensors.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Positioning</field><field name="subject">TDOA</field><field name="subject">Fingerprinting</field><field name="subject">WLAN</field><field name="subject">NLOS</field><field name="subject">Synchronization</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of underground coal gasification</field><field name="creator">Perkins, Gregory Martin Parry, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Mathematical models were developed to understand cavity growth mechanisms, heat and mass transfer in combination with chemical reaction, and the factors which affect gas production from an underground coal gasifier. A model for coal gasification in a one-dimensional spatial domain was developed and validated through comparison with experimental measurements of the pyrolysis of large coal particles and cylindrical coal blocks. The effects of changes in operating conditions and coal properties on cavity growth were quantified. It was found that the operating conditions which have the greatest impact on cavity growth are: temperature, water influx, pressure and gas composition, while the coal properties which have the greatest impact are: the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the coal, the coal composition and the thickness of the ash layer. Comparison of the model results with estimates from field scale trials, indicate that the model predicts growth rates with magnitudes comparable to those observed. Model results with respect to the effect of ash content, water influx and pressure are in agreement with trends observed in field trials. A computational fluid dynamics model for simulating the combined transport phenomena and chemical reaction in an underground coal gasification cavity has been developed. Simulations of a two-dimensional axi-symmetric cavity partially filled with an inert ash bed have shown that when the oxidant is injected from the bottom of the cavity, the fluid flow in the void space is dominated by a single buoyancy force due to temperature gradients established by the combustion of volatiles produced from the gasification of carbon at the cavity walls. Simulations in which the oxidant was injected from the top of the cavity reveal a weak fluid circulation due to the absence of strong buoyancy forces, leading to poor gasification performance. A channel model of gas production from underground coal gasification was developed, which incorporates a zero-dimensional cavity growth model and mass transfer due to natural convection. A model sensitivity study is presented and model simulations elucidate the effects of operating conditions and coal properties on gas production.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">underground coal gasification</field><field name="subject">combustion</field><field name="subject">transport phenomena</field><field name="subject">chemical reaction</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">cavity growth</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Decentralized virtual market-place for network services</field><field name="creator">Wongrujira, Krit, Electrical &amp; Telecommunication, UNSW</field><field name="description">With the increasing growth of communication networks, systems, and  devices,technology has  driven  much  research  and  development  on  a  variety  of communication protocols, applications, and smart devices.  As  a  result,  a variety of heterogeneous networks, de facto and standards have emerged.   In parallel, users are also demanding to  seamlessly  use  any  device  on any network infrastructure within this heterogeneous environment.  To go  beyond this problem, one of solutions is deploying service entities  to  be served in/on the network.   The  services  can  be composed  of  many  independent service entities to redirect the communication flow combined with  pipelined transformations.  The service in the network can start from  an  application to intercept the user flow in a range of formats, originating  in  different access networks, and deliver them appropriately formatted for  a particular end terminal based on the other end user preferences.   To provide independent services to be served within  the  network,  we  have created a decentralized virtual market-place, which facilitates a place  for services to be  traded, discovered,  and  composed  between  providers and consumers.  This approach of virtual market based on a decentralized  system is leading to many advantages and challenges compared to  other traditional network services.  This thesis presents  a  novel  approach  towards using  market  management techniques to improve cooperation among  traders  in  the  community,  while enhancing the community-oriented network service architecture.  Without  the centralized control, the decentralized  virtual  market-place requires  the inclusion  of  techniques  to provide  better   incentives.    Given   such incentives, rational  traders  will  choose  to behave  co-operatively  and contribute their resources to maximize  the  efficiency  of  the community. This  will  allow  an  application  with  dramatically   improved   utility, efficiency, and robustness and hence enable whole new domains of use.  The viability of the  decentralized  virtual market-place  is  demonstrated using a prototype implementation and simulation system.   The  results  have clearly shown that the decentralized virtual market-place  can  improve  and overcome the major problems of most existing network service models.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">peer to peer</field><field name="subject">network services</field><field name="subject">reputation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality control for integrated GNSS and inertial navigation systems</field><field name="creator">Hewitson, Steve, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The availability of GPS signals is a major limitation for many existing and potential applications.

The combination of these techniques allowed us to relate the PEO layer density and molecular conformations to the range, magnitude and types of forces generated by coatings of various grafting densities. The key optimisation parameter was the grafting time with the concentration of PEO in solution having a weaker effect. Oxidation of the substrate occurred, but did not significantly limit the surface density of the functional groups used to chemically attach the PEO molecules. Interactions between the substrate and silica were electrostatic in origin and did not contribute to the interaction between silica and the PEO surfaces due to salt screening effects Surfaces with dense, highly stretched PEO layers (brushes) generated purely repulsive forces at all separation distances, arising from compression by the silica spherical probe used. The force profiles for lower density surfaces comprised long-ranged attractive and short-ranged repulsive forces. The attractive forces were most likely due to attractive bridging interactions between the PEO chains and the SiO2 surface. For low grafting densities, i.e. inter-chain grafting distances, s &amp;gt ??RF, the PEO layers were not strongly stretched and free to adsorb onto the opposing silica surface. XPS analysis demonstrated that HSA and Fibrinogen adsorbed onto low density 20 kDa PEO coatings (s &amp;gt ??RF), most likely via diffusion through the PEO layer. No protein adsorption was found (detection limit &amp;gt 10 ng/cm2) on high density, ???strongly stretched brush??? coatings (s &amp;lt ?? RF). Analysis of data from the more sensitive Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) techniques indicated that low amounts of adsorbed HSA, lactoferrin, lysozyme, and IgG were present on high density 20 and 40 kDa surfaces; the most likely explanation being attractive interactions between the proteins and the PEO layers during the protein adsorption experiments. ToF-SIMS data obtained for the strongly stretched (s &amp;lt ?? RF) 5 kDa PEO surfaces suggested that no protein was adsorbed, in line with the XPS data for the same surfaces.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surface chemistry</field><field name="subject">Proteins</field><field name="subject">Adsorption</field><field name="subject">Polyethylene oxide</field><field name="subject">Fouling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A late quaternary palaeoenvironmental investigation of the fire, climate, human and vegetation nexus from the Sydney basin, Australia</field><field name="creator">Black, Manu, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">It is widely believed that Australian Aboriginals utilised fire to manage various landscapes however to what extent this impacted on Australia???s ecosystems remains uncertain. The late Pleistocene/Holocene fire history from three sites within the Sydney Basin, Gooches Swamp, Lake Baraba and Kings Waterhole, were compared with archaeological and palaeoclimatic data using a novel method of quantifying macroscopic charcoal, which is presented in this study. The palynology and other palaeoecological proxies were also investigated at the three sites. The Gooches Swamp fire record appeared to be most influenced by climate and there was an abrupt increase in fire activity from the mid-Holocene perhaps associated with the onset of modern El Ni??o dominated conditions. The Kings Waterhole site also displayed an abrupt increase in charcoal at this time however there was a marked decrease in charcoal from ~3 ka. Lake Baraba similarly had displayed low levels of charcoal in the late Holocene. At both Kings Waterhole and Lake Baraba archaeological evidence suggests intensified human activity in the late Holocene during this period of lower and less variable charcoal. It is hence likely that at these sites Aboriginal people controlled fire activity in the late Holocene perhaps in response to the increased risk of large intense fires under an ENSO-dominated climate. The fire history of the Sydney Basin varies temporally and spatially and therefore it is not possible to make generalisations about pre-historic fire regimes. It is also not possible to use ideas about Aboriginal fire regimes or pre-historic activity as a management objective. The study demonstrates that increased fire activity is related to climatic variation and this is likely to be of significance under various enhanced Greenhouse scenarios. There were no major changes in the composition of the flora at all sites throughout late Pleistocene/Holocene although there were some changes in the relative abundance of different taxa. It is suggested that the Sydney Sandstone flora, which surrounds the sites, is relatively resistant to environmental changes. Casuarinaceae was present at Lake Baraba during the Last Glacial Maximum and therefore the site may have acted as a potential refugium for more mesic communities. There was a notable decline in Casuarinaceae during the Holocene at Lake Baraba and Kings Waterhole, a trend that has been found at a number of sites from southeastern Australia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Paleobiogeography - Australia</field><field name="subject">Paleoclimatology - Australia</field><field name="subject">Nature - Effect of human beings on - New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Paleoecology - Quaternary</field><field name="subject">Paleobotany - Quaternary</field><field name="subject">Paleoethnobotany</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rapid development of problem-solvers with HeurEAKA! - a heuristic evolutionary algorithm and incremental knowledge acquisition approach</field><field name="creator">Bekmann, Joachim Peter, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A new approach for the development of problem-solvers for combinatorial problems is proposed in this thesis. The approach combines incremental knowledge acquisition and probabilistic search algorithms, such as evolutionary algorithms, to allow a human to rapidly develop problem-solvers in new domains in a framework called HeurEAKA. The approach addresses a known problem, that is, adapting evolutionary algorithms to the search domain by the introduction of domain knowledge. The development of specialised problem-solvers has historically been labour intensive. Implementing a problem-solver from scratch is very time consuming. Another approach is to adapt a general purpose search strategy to the problem domain. This is motivated by the observation that in order to scale an algorithm to solve complex problems, domain knowledge is needed. At present there is no systematic approach allowing one to efficiently engineer a specialpurpose search strategy for a given search problem. This means that, for example, adapting evolutionary algorithms (which are general purpose algorithms) is often very difficult and has lead some people to refer to their use as a ???black art???. In the HeurEAKA approach, domain knowledge is introduced by incrementally building a knowledge base that controls parts of the evolutionary algorithm. For example, the fitness function and the mutation operators in a genetic algorithm. An evolutionary search algorithm ismonitored by a human whomakes recommendations on search strategy based on individual solution candidates. It is assumed that the human has a reasonable intuition of the search problem. The human adds rules to a knowledge base describing how candidate solutions can be improved, or why they are desirable or undesirable in the search for a good solution. The incremental knowledge acquisition approach is inspired by the idea of (Nested) Ripple Down Rules. This approach sees a human provide exception rules to rules already existing in the knowledge base using concrete examples of inappropriate performance of the existing knowledge base. The Nested Ripple Down Rules (NRDR) approach allows humans to compose rules using concepts that are natural and intuitive to them. In HeurEAKA, NRDR are significantly adapted to form part of a probabilistic search algorithm. The probabilistic search algorithms used in the presented system are a genetic algorithm and a hierarchical bayesian optimization algorithm. The success of the HeurEAKA approach is demonstrated in experiments undertaken on industrially relevant domains. Problem-solvers were developed for detailed channel and switchbox routing in VLSI design and traffic light optimisation for urban road networks. The problem-solvers were developed in a short amount of time, in domains where a large amount of effort has gone into developing existing algorithms. Experiments show that chosen benchmark problems are solved as well or better than existing approaches. Particularly in the traffic light optimisation domain excellent results are achieved.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Problem solving - Computer programs</field><field name="subject">Artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">Traffic lights - Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attitudes to safety and organisational culture in Australian military aviation</field><field name="creator">Falconer, Boyd Travis, School of Aviation, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes original research that examines the extent to which organisational culture, and psychosocial aspects specifically, relate to individuals??? ???normal??? performance within Australian Defence Force (ADF) aviation. The primary rationale for the research relates to the ???safety record??? of ADF aviation, whereby more than fifty ???peace time??? fatalities have occurred in ADF aviation accidents since 1990 and many of these have links to organisational culture attributes. The secondary rationale relates to a more general perspective: previous research identifies human functioning in military aviation ??? more than any other aviation domain ??? as being dependent upon psychosocial attributes including interpersonal collaboration, communication and coordination. However, the depth to which such qualities impact the safety of a sociotechnical system remains substantially uncharted.  This thesis firstly examines both scientific and Australian military literature on organisational behaviour, culture and human factors. Subsequently, it describes the design and implementation of a new 45-item questionnaire ??? the Australian Defence Force Aviation Questionnaire (ADFAQ). More than four hundred ADF aircrew and engineers completed the ADFAQ. The data analysis involved quantitative and qualitative consideration of survey responses and comparisons between numerous demographic criteria. Following this, the thesis describes the design and implementation of an interview study that was designed to both cross-examine key ADFAQ results and explore more deeply other issues that were only superficially identified by the (largely psychometric) composition of the ADFAQ.  The research results offer three main contributions to scientific knowledge. These relate to: (1) the efficacy of triangulated and contextualised methodology in building an understanding of organisational culture; (2) the nature of the safety culture concept and its relationship with organisational culture; and (3) rank-based homogeneity of attitudes. This research shows that survey methodologies are not a panacea, but they can illuminate the nature of attitudes to safety and provide empirical guidance for other methods to explore more deeply the cultural roots of such attitudes and associated behaviours.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aeronautics, Military - Safety measures - Australia</field><field name="subject">Airplanes, Military - Accidents - Australia</field><field name="subject">Aircraft accidents - Human factors - Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pattern recognition receptors in the immunopathogenesis of acute anterior uveitis</field><field name="creator">Chang, John Hyun-Min, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Acute anterior uveitis (AAU) is the most common form of intraocular inflammatory disease and an important cause of visual impairment. Microbial triggers to the development of AAU have been strongly implicated, however the pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms for this are unclear. Toll-like receptors (TLR) and nucleotide oligomerisation domain receptors (NOD) are pattern recognition receptors (PRR) of the innate immune system that facilitate immediate recognition and immunostimulatory responses to unique molecular patterns of microbial components, including the production of chemoattractant cytokines called chemokines. The major aim of this study was to investigate the role of PRRs, namely TLRs and NODs, in the pathogenesis of human AAU. The mRNA and protein expressions of TLR4 and NOD2 in the normal human eye were determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Resident antigen presenting cells of the normal human uvea expressed TLR4 protein. NOD2 protein expression was highly restricted to a subpopulation of retinal cells. A selective perturbation in the expression and function of TLRs were demonstrated in active human AAU by flow cytometry and in vitro stimulation with selective TLR agonists. These changes were not due to any polymorphisms in the TLR genes. Elevated plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an agonist for TLR4, were not detected in patients with active AAU by the limulus amebocyte lysate assay. New information regarding the complex in vivo network of cytokines in active human AAU were provided by multiplex cytokine bead immunoassay on aqueous humor samples, including a Th1-polarised pattern of aqueous humor cytokines, the intraocular expression of multiple LPS-inducible cytokines, and the aqueous humor expression of cytokines such as IL-17 in AAU. Expressions of the respective chemokine receptors on peripheral blood leukocytes were also determined.  The findings of this study provides several lines of evidence to support the hypothesis that PRRs, namely TLRs and NODs, are of pathogenic importance in the development of clinical AAU. The results of this study provide significant new information regarding the role of PRRs in ocular immunity and immune privilege, their role in the pathogenesis of AAU, and it provides a molecular mechanism whereby microbial triggers could initiate the development of uveitis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uveitis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Camera obscura: representations of indigenous identity within Australian cinema</field><field name="creator">Rekhari, Suneeti, School of Sociology &amp; Anthropology, UNSW</field><field name="description">Karen Jennings (1993) and Peter Krausz (2003) in their works, written ten years apart, note the changing ways in which the academic world and the media have dealt with representations of Indigenous identity.

The fact that it does not, initiates the questions addressed in this thesis: whether Australian cinema explores Indigenous issues in sufficient depth and with cultural resonance. Can a study of cinematic representations lead to a better understanding of Aboriginal identity? In representing Aboriginality on screen does the cinema present a representational complex for Indigenous Australia, which is constructed on their behalf by the cinema itself? In this thesis these questions are theoretically framed within a semiotic methodology, which is applied to the examination of the complexities of representation. This is done through an analysis of the connotations and stereotyping of Indigenous identity in filmic narratives; and the operation of narrative closure and myth making systems through historical time periods; and dualisms in the filmic narratives such as primitive/civilised, us/them, self/other; and the presence of Aboriginality as an absent signifier. The four films chosen for comparative analysis are Jedda, Night Cries, Walkabout and Rabbit Proof Fence. These films span a period of fifty years, which allows for an explication of the changes that have occurred over the passing of time in their visual representations of Aboriginal identity. Hence social and cultural filmic identity representations are juxtaposed with the historical and political discourses prevalent at the time of their production. Through such a detailed analysis of the four film texts, the dominant social discourses of Australia are analysed in relation to their operation as representational frameworks for Indigenous Australians.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians in motion pictures</field><field name="subject">Motion pictures</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25765</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between self-efficacy and self-regulated behaviour within a secondary school music technology based creative learning environment.</field><field name="creator">Merrick, Bradley Maxwell, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study employed the theoretical framework of Albert Bandura???s social cognitive theory, to investigate how differing levels of self-efficacy impact on both the type and degree of self-regulatory behaviour employed by the students when composing music in a high school music program. The literature review revealed an abundance of related research suggesting a strong relationship between self-efficacy and self-regulated behaviour in the ???core??? academic domains of education. In contrast, there was no specific research found that had examined self-efficacy and self-regulation in the context of students composing music.  An independent school in Sydney served as the research site, with sixty-eight students of varied year levels and musical experience participating in the study. Students used stand alone computers, the software ???Cubase??? and MIDI keyboards as they completed a task that involved creating an original piece of music in a genre of their own choice, over a series of four composition sessions.  A mixed methodology was employed to determine if the influence of the students??? self-efficacy beliefs upon their self-regulation in a creative activity were consistent with existing research. Data were collected using a mixture of weekly measures and self-report scales, combined with a variety of questionnaires, logs, tally sheets and interviews. Eight variables, including the self-regulatory sub-processes of goal setting-strategic planning, intrinsic motivation, goal orientation, task expectation, time on task, task completion, monitoring were analysed together with an additional variable, defined as creative ability, to determine if evidence could be found of a relationship between self-efficacy and these specific behaviours while composing.  The results suggest that the pre-task (Week 1) measure of self-efficacy was closely associated with the students??? use of the eight self-regulatory dimensions as well as their perceived level of creative ability. Weekly self-efficacy measures also suggested that students??? employ self-regulated sub-processes proportionally to their respective levels of self-efficacy. Importantly, the more efficacious students employed a wider and more sophisticated repertoire of self-regulated behaviour when composing in contrast to the less efficacious students. Self-efficacy was also identified as a key factor amongst students who were initially identified as being naive self-regulators, but who through the duration of the task, modified their behaviour to become more skilful self-regulators. Throughout the study, the consistent level of interaction between self-efficacy and the use of self-regulated behaviours were aligned with findings in the core ???academic??? disciplines of education.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social cognitive theory</field><field name="subject">self-efficacy</field><field name="subject">self-regulation</field><field name="subject">secondary school music</field><field name="subject">music technology</field><field name="subject">MIDI</field><field name="subject">creativity</field><field name="subject">composition</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">strategic planning</field><field name="subject">goal setting</field><field name="subject">intrinsic motivation</field><field name="subject">goal orientation</field><field name="subject">task expectation</field><field name="subject">time on task</field><field name="subject">task completion</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">self-reflection</field><field name="subject">sequencer</field><field name="subject">computers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Islamic revivalism: a study of the Tablighi Jamaat in Sydney</field><field name="creator">Ali, Jan Ashik, School of Sociology &amp; Anthropology, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since the great Iranian revolution of 1978-79, there has been a significant increase in Islamic consciousness and activity in Muslim communities across the globe. As a phenomenon it has become known as ???Islamic revivalism???. Its hallmark is a return to Islamic origins, the fundamentals of the faith embodied in the Qur???an and the sunnah (sayings and practices of Prophet Muhammad). Contemporary Islamic revivalism has its roots in Muslim responses to European colonialism and imperialism at the turn of the twentieth century, when the darker sides of modernity began to reveal themselves in what was perceived as less than desirable social, cultural, economic, and political conditions of many Muslim communities and societies. Islamic revivalism has constantly featured in Islamic history and is by no means a new phenomenon. What distinguishes contemporary Islamic revivalism from earlier revivalisms is its complex multifacetedness as a defensive reaction to a new epoch of modernity described in revivalist circles as jahiliyah (ignorance). This thesis argues there is a central relationship between modernity and Islamic revivalism. Using in-depth interviews and participant observation techniques this study is an ethnography of the Tablighi Jamaat (Preaching Party), a transnational Islamic revivalist movement active in Sydney. It also seeks to locate the Tablighi Jamaat in the spectrum of Australian Islam. The principal argument of the thesis is that contemporary Islamic revivalism is a defensive reaction to modernity. Contrary to popular belief it neither constitutes an antimodernity nor does it seek to destroy modernity. Rather, it highlights that Muslims as adherents to a revealed tradition - Islam - are in a serious state of crisis. They are confronted with both material crisis and the threat of losing their faith and identity in modernity. Through a study of the Tablighi Jamaat the thesis argues that contemporary Islamic revivalism is, therefore, an attempt to rescue Muslims from their modern malaise through selective use of modern ideological and technical means.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Islamic renewal</field><field name="subject">Islam - New South Wales - Sydney</field><field name="subject">Globalization - Religious aspects - Islam</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25771</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simultaneous optimization of beam positions for treatment planning and for image reconstruction in radiotherapy</field><field name="creator">Widita, Rena, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">From one treatment to the next, considerable effort is made to accurately position radiotherapy patients according to their treatment plans. However, some variation is unavoidable. The target volume and the organs at risk may also move within the patient and/or change shape during the treatment. Thus, it is important to be able to verify the success of the treatment by determining the position of patient and the dose deposited in the patient at each fraction. One possibility to achieve this, particularly when equipment, time and budgets are limited, would be to collect limited information while the patient is on the treatment couch. This research was aimed to develop a method for optimum beam position determination, for each patient-specific case. The optimized beam positions would balance the both treatment planning and image reconstruction, so that the patient???s image can be obtained during the treatment delivery using the information collected from the same angles as used for treatment. This will allow verification of the dose deposited in the patient for every fraction. Using a limited number of angles for image reconstruction, the dose to the patient can be minimized. This work has two major parts, beam position optimization for image reconstruction and beam position optimization for treatment planning. These two optimizations are then combined to obtain the optimum beam position for both image reconstruction and treatment planning. An objective function, projection correlation, was developed to investigate the image reconstruction method using limited information. Another objective function, the average optimization quality factor, was also introduced to optimize beam positions for treatment planning. Two optimization methods, the gradient descent method and the simulated annealing based on these objective functions were used to determine the beam angles. The results show that the projection correlation presents several advantages. It can be applied without any iterations, and it produces a fast algorithm. The present research will allow selection of the optimum beam positions without excessive computational cost for treatment planning and imaging. By combining the projection correlation and the average optimization quality factor together with more advanced image reconstruction software this could potentially be used in a clinical environment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Beam optics</field><field name="subject">Imaging systems in medicine</field><field name="subject">Radiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Severe biomechanical conditions in total hip replacement.</field><field name="creator">Walter, William Lindsay, School of Biomechanics, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hip simulators are designed to reproduce the forces and motion patterns of normal walking. In vivo demands on total hip replacements, however, are varied and often more severe than normal walking conditions. It is these severe conditions that often lead to implant failure. This is clinically based research aimed at understanding some of the more severe conditions in hips and the effect that these have on the performance of the total hip replacement. The polyethylene liner can act as a pump in an acetabular component, forcing fluid and wear particles through the holes to the retroacetabular bone causing osteolysis. Ten patients were studied at revision surgery. Pressures were measured in retroacetabular osteolytic lesions while performing pumping manouvers with the hip. Two laboratory experiments were then designed to study pumping mechanisms in vitro. In patients with contained osteolytic lesions, fluid pressure fluctuations could be measured in the lesion in association with the pumping action. Patients with uncontained osteolytic lesions showed no such pressure fluctuations. In the laboratory we identified 3 distinct mechanisms whereby fluid can be pumped from the hip joint to the retroacetabular bone. These pumping effects could be mitigated by improved implant design. Loading of the femoral head against the edge of the acetabular component produces dramatically increased contact pressures particularly in hard-on-hard bearings. In an analysis of 16 retrieved ceramic-on-ceramic bearings we were able to characterise the mechanism of edge loading based on the pattern of edge loading wear on the bearing surface. Finally in a radiographic study of patients with squeaking ceramic-on-ceramic hips. Squeaking was found to be associated with acetabular component malposition. It seems that edge loading or impingement may be an associated factor in these cases.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Total hip replacement</field><field name="subject">Artificial hip joints</field><field name="subject">Hip joint - Surgery</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25968</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Everyday narratives - reconsidering filmic temporality and spectatorial affect through the quotidian</field><field name="creator">Rassos, Effie, School of Media, Film &amp; Theatre, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis takes as its focus the relation between particular constructions of filmic time and the resulting affective and emotional experiences these temporalities produce on a spectatorial level. This connection between time and affect is thought through more specifically here in relation to an idea of the everyday not only as a thematic concern with the minutia of routine daily existence but also as distinct, and yet shifting, conceptions of filmic and viewing time. While film studies has often approached the temporal construction of the quotidian through the rubric of ???real time,??? I explore different articulations of the everyday in a number of film practices through the writings of Henri Lefebvre. As a sociologist and philosopher preoccupied with the revolutionary quality of everyday time in both material reality and art practices including film, Lefebvre???s work enables this thesis to approach film as an especially potent and significant site for affective experiences of time and of the everyday. Beginning with John Cassavetes??? Faces (1968) and an analysis of an affective everyday temporality that film is able to produce as a temporal medium, this thesis goes on to consider the quotidian through photography and stillness in Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (Chantal Akerman, 1975), dying and witnessing via Silverlake Life: The View from Here (Tom Joslin and Peter Friedman, 1993), and finally melodrama and unrequited love in Wong Kar-wai???s In the Mood for  Love (Huayang Nianhua, 2000). In the analysis of these films and videos, this thesis draws on film debates explicitly concerned with time as well as focusing on those places in philosophy and critical theory where a promising and productive articulation of film and its inscription of time and affect can be found and conceptualised. In this investigation, the everyday as both a temporal construction and a spectatorial affective experience is a means to reflect on the cinema as a continually shifting and dynamic affective site.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Time in motion pictures</field><field name="subject">Motion picture audiences</field><field name="subject">Motion pictures - Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Motion pictures - Aesthetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trust negotiation policy management for service-oriented applications</field><field name="creator">Skogsrud, Halvard, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Service-oriented architectures (SOA), and in particular Web services, have quickly become a popular technology to connect applications both within and across enterprise boundaries. However, as services are increasingly used to implement critical functionality, security has become an important concern impeding the widespread adoption of SOA.  Trust negotiation is an approach to access control that may be applied in scenarios where service requesters are often unknown in advance, such as for services available via the public Internet. Rather than relying on requesters' identities, trust negotiation makes access decisions based on the level of trust established between the requester and the provider in a negotiation, during which the parties exchange credentials, which are signed assertions that describe some attributes of the owner.  However, managing the evolution of trust negotiation policies is a difficult problem that has not been sufficiently addressed to date. Access control policies have a lifecycle, and they are revised based on applicable business policies. Additionally, because a trust relationship established in a trust negotiation may be long lasting, their evolution must also be managed. Simply allowing a negotiation to continue according to an old policy may be undesirable, especially if new important constraints have been added.  In this thesis, we introduce a model-driven trust negotiation framework for service-oriented applications. The framework employs a model for trust negotiation, based on state machines, that allows automated generation of the control structures necessary to enforce trust negotiation policies from the visual model of the policy. Our policy model also supports lifecycle management. We provide sets of operations to modify policies and to manage ongoing negotiations, and operators for identifying and managing impacts of changes to trust negotiation policies on ongoing trust negotiations.  The framework presented in the thesis has been implemented in the Trust-Serv prototype, which leverages industry specifications such as WS-Security and WS-Trust to offer a container-centric mechanism for deploying trust negotiation that is transparent to the services being protected.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">security</field><field name="subject">web services</field><field name="subject">trust negotiation</field><field name="subject">trust management</field><field name="subject">modeling</field><field name="subject">SOA</field><field name="subject">service-oriented applications</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exhaled nitric oxide in asthmatic airway inflammation</field><field name="creator">Ratnawati, Ratnawati, Prince of Wale Hospital Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Measuring the level of exhaled NO (eNO) in the breath is a new method to monitor airway inflammation in asthma and may have a role in the management of asthma. The hypotheses were that eNO will reflect the degree of inflammation in chronic asthma, and will indicate how anti- inflammatory therapy should be altered to improve asthma control. Three studies were performed to test the hypotheses. A cross sectional study was performed to define the normal range of eNO and to compare this range with those who have asthma or atopy. The second study was observational, to compare the level of eNO during and after an exacerbation of asthma. The third study was an interventional study to evaluate eNO in management of paediatric asthma. In this latter study the level of eNO was measured to monitor airway inflammation in asthmatic children with the intention of adjusting antiinflammatory drugs (inhaled glucocorticosteroids) according to the level of eNO. These studies have shown that the mean level of eNO was significantly higher in asthmatic compared with normal subjects, but not significantly different when compared with atopic non-asthmatic subjects. eNO was correlated with the number of positive skin prick tests in atopic subjects whether asthmatic or nonasthmatic. The eNO level was increased during acute exacerbations of asthma and decreased after two weeks with therapy of GCS. In a pilot study eNO appeared to be superior to FEV1 in adjusting the dose of iGCS to control asthmatic children, but this needs to be confirmed with a larger sample size.  Another non-invasive method to detect inflammatory markers is the technique of exhaled breath condensate (EBC). Although NO is degraded to NOx, it was found that eNO had no significant correlation with EBC NOx but had a significant correlation with pH. Hypertonic saline challenge, an artificial model of an asthmatic exacerbation was associated with an increase in EBC volume and the release of histamine, implicating mast cell activation. These novel findings suggest that non-invasive markers can be used both for clinical and mechanistic proposes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Airway (Medicine) - Inflammation</field><field name="subject">Respiratory organs - Diseases</field><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the use of positive performance indicators to measure OHS performance</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Ian Robert, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development, application and evaluation of an OHS measurement tool incorporating positive performance indicators to measure OHS performance in Australia Post, a large multi-site postal organisation. Positive Performance Indicators (PPIs) are identified as systematically implemented measures of the management processes initiated to achieve strategic goals. A literature review indicated that there was widespread support for the use of PPIs to measure OHS performance, with proponents advocating their use to monitor and promote implementation of target OHS strategies, and to evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies by using PPIs in conjunction with outcome indicators. Despite this widespread support, there was little practical guidance published on the development or application of PPIs, nor was there empirical evidence validating the claims of advocates. A series of research projects was undertaken to firstly develop - then evaluate - a set of OHS self-assessment tools incorporating PPIs. These projects comprised: review of the Australia Post OHS strategic plan, as the basis for the development of PPIs to measure that plan; development of a set of paper-based self-assessment tools incorporating quantitative OHS PPIs to measure the local implementation of the OHS strategic plan; quasi-experimental pilot study of the use of the OHS PPI self-assessment tools by Postal Managers, to investigate the reliability and effectiveness of the OHS PPI process in monitoring and driving conformance of OHS management processes; experimental study of the use of the OHS PPI self-assessment tools by Postal Delivery Facility Managers, to validate and extend the findings of the pilot study; development of a web-based software application to facilitate OHS PPI data collection and reporting; and, the use of correlation statistics to study the relationship of OHS PPIs with OHS outcome measures, and to assess their role in evaluating the effectiveness of specific OHS strategies. The studies demonstrated that the OHS PPI self-assessment tool could be effectively used by local facility managers to assess and report their implementation of the OHS strategic plan. In addition, the OHS PPI self-assessment process proved to strongly improve the local implementation of those OHS management processes measured. The study further showed that the consistent attention to OHS management processes driven by the OHS PPI measurement process assisted in the achievement of impressive OHS outcome improvements. However, the study showed that the use of correlation statistics to link OHS PPIs with outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of OHS management strategies has only limited value. Limitations in both the OHS PPI and outcome measurement data and in the correlation statistics restrict the extent to which findings can be interpreted or that conclusive judgements concerning the effectiveness of strategies can be drawn. The thesis concludes with an account of Australia Post's experiences in integrating OHS PPIs into its OHS management system.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial safety - Australia</field><field name="subject">Postal service - Australia - Safety measures</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The characterization of Csp (Cold Shock Protein) from the Antarctic archaeon, Methanogenium frigidum</field><field name="creator">Giaquinto, Laura, School of Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cold shock proteins (Csp) are small acidic proteins that fold into ??-barrel structures with five anti-parallel ??-strands and are involved in essential cellular processes. Upon temperature downshift the synthesis of Csp proteins is drastically increased to enable cells to restore growth in the cold. These proteins facilitate transcription and translation at low temperature by functioning as RNA chaperones. Csp proteins have been most extensively studied in Bacteria but very few Csp homologues have been identified and studied in Archaea. This is the first study examining structural, functional and biophysical properties of Csp from the Antarctic archaeon Methanogenium frigidum. The fastidious growth requirements of M. frigidum make it difficult to cultivate, therefore recombinant methods have been developed for the expression and characterization of the protein. The analysis by transverse urea gradient gel electrophoresis (TUG-GE) revealed that M. frigidum Csp folds by a reversible two-state mechanism and has a low conformational stability. The spectroscopic analysis of the protein performed by Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy disclosed features typical of other homologous proteins. A possible association between Csp and RNA has been proposed according to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis. The effect of a Nterminal polyhistidine affinity tag on the biophysical properties of Csp was also examined. The biological activity of Csp was investigated by complementation of an E. coli cold sensitive mutant. These studies revealed that the M. frigidum Csp is biologically active and can function in E. coli.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proteins</field><field name="subject">Archaebacteria</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shoulder pain in elite swimmers</field><field name="creator">Sein, Mya Lay, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Shoulder pain in elite swimmers is common and its cause is unknown. One hypothesis is that repetitive swimming leads to shoulder laxity, which in turn leads to impingement and shoulder pain. An observational cross-sectional study was designed to test this hypothesis. Eighty elite swimmers (13-25 years of age) completed questionnaires on their swimming training, pain and shoulder function. They were given a standardized clinical shoulder examination, and tested for inferior glenohumeral joint laxity using a noninvasive electronic laxometer designed for this study. Fifty-two swimmers also attended for a shoulder MRI. The laxometer had good-excellent reliability for inter-observer (Intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC = 0.74) and intra-observer (ICC = 0.76) assessments of joint laxity. The reliability of MRI-determined supraspinatus tendinosis was excellent with a single experienced musculoskeletal radiologist (intra-observer ICC = 0.85) and fair for an inter-observer assessment including less experienced radiologists (ICC = 0.55). MRIdetermined supraspinatus tendinosis was present in 36/52 (69%) swimmers, including four international-level athletes. A positive impingement sign correlated with supraspinatus tendinosis (r = 0.49, p = 0.0002). The impingement sign had 100% sensitivity and 65% specificity for diagnosing supraspinatus tendinopathy. Shoulder laxity correlated modestly with impingement (r = 0.23, p &amp;lt 0.05). There was no association between shoulder laxity and supraspinatus tendinosis (r = 0.24, p = 0.08). The number of hours swum/week (r = 0.36, p = 0.01) and the weekly mileage (r = 0.34,  p = 0.02) both correlated significantly with supraspinatus tendinopathy whereas swimming stroke preference did not. Multiple logistic regression analysis performed with supraspinatus tendinopathy as the dependent variable showed the combination of hours swum/week and weekly mileage correctly predicted tendinopathy in 85% of elite swimmers. These data indicate that: (1) supraspinatus tendinopathy is a major cause of shoulder pain in elite swimmers; and (2) this supraspinatus tendinopathy is induced by the volume/dose of swimming; and (3) shoulder laxity per se has only a minimal association with shoulder impingement in elite swimmers. These finding in humans are consistent with animal and tissue culture findings which support the hypothesis that tendinopathy is related to the dose and duration of load to tendon cells.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shoulder pain</field><field name="subject">Swimmers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26165</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical simulation of blood flow in the systemic vasculature incorporating gravitational force with application to the cerebral circulation</field><field name="creator">Alirezaye-Davatgar, Mohammad Taghi, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background. Extensive studies have been conducted to simulate blood flow in the human vasculature using nonlinear equations of pulsatile flow in collapsible tube plus a network of vessels to represent the whole vasculature and the cerebral circulation. For non-linear models numerical solutions are obtained for the fluid flow equations. Methods. Equations of fluid motion in collapsible tubes were developed in the presence of gravitational force (Gforce). The Lax-Wendroff and MacCormack methods were used to solve the governing equations and compared both in terms of accuracy, convergence, and computer processing (CPU) time. A modified vasculature of the whole body and the cerebral circulation was developed to obtain a realistic simulation of blood flow under different conditions. The whole body vasculature was used to validate the simulation in terms of input impedance and wave transmission. The cerebral vasculature was used to simulate conditions such as presence of G-force, blockage of Internal Carotid Artery (ICA), and the effects on cerebral blood flow of changes in mean and pulse pressure. Results. The simulation results for zero G-force were in very good agreement with published experimental data as was the simulation of cerebral blood flow. Both numerical methods for solutions of governing equations gave similar results for blood flow simulations but differed in calculation performance and stability depending on levels of G-force. Simulation results for uniform and sinusoidal G-force are also in good agreement with published experimental results, Blood flow was simulated in the presence of a single (left) carotid artery obstruction with varying morphological structures of the Circle of Willis (CoW). This simulation showed significant differences in contralateral blood flow in the presence or absence of communicating arteries in the CoW. It also was able to simulate the decreases in blood flow in the cerebral circulation compartment corresponding to the visual cortex in the presence of G-force. This is consistent with the known loss of vision under increased acceleration. Conclusions. This study has shown that under conditions of gravitational forces physiological changes in blood flow in the systemic and cerebral vasculature can be simulated realistically by solving the one-dimentional fluid flow equations and non-linear vascular properties numerically. The simulation was able to predict changes in blood flow with different configurations and properties of the vascular network.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blood flow - Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Blood flow - Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Cerebral circulation</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system - Computer simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26177</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bioinformatic analyses of microarray experiments on genetic control of gene expression level</field><field name="creator">Kirk, Michael, School of Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The advent of microarray technology, allowing measurement of gene expression levels for thousands of genes in parallel, has made possible experiments designed to investigate the genetic control of variation in gene expression level (described in the literature as ???genetical genomics??? or ???eQTL??? experiments). Published results from these studies, in yeast and in mice, show that genetic variation is an important factor in gene regulation, and furthermore that individual polymorphisms modify the expression level of many genes. The concern of this thesis is the bioinformatic analyses of the expression level and genotype data sets that are the raw material for these studies. In particular this thesis addresses the two issues of detection of artefactual effects, and maximizing the information that can be extracted from the data. It is shown that while a polymorphism affecting the expression of many genes may be readily detected, care must be taken to determine whether the detected effect is genuinely one of genetic control of expression level, rather than the effect of correlations in measured expression level not of genetic cause. A significance test is devised to distinguish between these cases. The detection of artefactual correlation is explored further in the reanalysis of the published data from a large yeast study. A critique is given of the permutation method used to ascribe genetic control as the cause of inter gene expression level correlation. The presence of some degree of artefactual correlation is shown, and novel methods are presented for identifying such artefacts. To extend the analyses that may be applied to eQTL data, an algorithm is presented for determining secondary eQTLs for gene expression level (as opposed to a single primary QTL), along with a significance test for the putative QTL found. The technique is demonstrated on a large public data set. In addition to the use for which they are intended, the data sets generated for eQTL studies provide opportunities for additional analyses. In this thesis a method is developed for calculating a genome wide map of meiotic recombination frequency from the genotype data for multiple segregant strains. The method is demonstrated on the published genotype data generated for a large yeast eQTL study.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA microarrays gene expression</field><field name="subject">bioinformatics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25986</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The intra-pixel sensitivity variation of a CCD</field><field name="creator">Toyozumi, Hiroyuki, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The effect of Intra-pixel sensitivity variation (IPSV) in charge-coupled devices (CCDs) can be important in astronomical applications. This thesis studies the IPSV in a front-illuminated three-phase EEV05-20 CCD used in the Automated Patrol Telescope (APT), from multiple points of view.  To explore the detailed sensitivity variation within pixels, the CCD was scanned using a 4 \mu meter diameter light beam in four colour bands: B, V, R and I. The resulting images clearly show the IPSVs due to the CCD electrode structure, and its dependence on wavelength. Unexpected ghost images appear in the scan images that are most likely due to the charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) of the CCD. A correction procedure for the CTI effect is presented.  Using the pixel response function (PRF) which was derived from the CCD scans, instrumental point spread functions (iPSFs) were calculated from dithered images observed by the APT. The accurate iPSFs allowed us to generate a variety of simulated images of APT observations, enabling us to analyse in detail the effect of IPSV on astronomical observations.  One of the astronomical impacts of IPSV is on photometry. The IPSV effect on the precision for estimating star fluxes was studied using both observed and simulated images. The IPSV effect can be expressed as magnitude estimation error maps plotted against the fractional part of a star's coordinates. The IPSV effect introduces \pm 4% errors in star fluxes for observed images with the APT in V band.  Another astronomical impact of IPSV is on astrometry. IPSV influences the precision for estimating star coordinates, and this was studied using a number of simulated images. The IPSV effect can be expressed as coordinate estimation error maps plotted against the fractional part of a star's coordinates. The IPSV effect introduces \sim 0.02 pixel errors in RMS for images observed with the APT in V band.  The appearance of the unexpected ghost images in the CCD scans suggested that CTI might also affect observed images. We examined the effects on PSFs and photometry. The CTI effect does affect the shapes of PSFs, but only to a small fraction. Its effect on photometry is negligible.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">techniques: photometric</field><field name="subject">astrometric --- instrumentation: detectors</field><field name="subject">CTI</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Submerged hollow fibre membranes in bubbling systems</field><field name="creator">Wicaksana, Filicia, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the optimisation of submerged hollow fibre membrane performance by analysing the role of air sparging on the reduction of membrane fouling. In submerged hollow fibre membranes, rising bubbles have been shown to induce shear, liquid movement and fibre displacement. The interaction between fibre movement induced by bubbling and the microfiltration performance was assessed for various parameters (fibre tightness, fibre length, fibre diameter, air flowrate, nozzle size, and feed concentration). A model feed of yeast suspension and a series of isolated fibres were used. The fibre movement was assessed by monitoring the displacement using video recording. Bubble population parameters were also measured. The results suggest that bubbleinduced fibre movement plays an important role in controlling membrane fouling. Investigations of the critical flux at various operating conditions also supported these conclusions. Since energy consumption for aeration is a major contributor to the cost in submerged membranes, the potential to minimise the aeration cost has been tested by implementing intermittent aeration and different nozzle sizes. It was found that an optimum condition associated with a low fouling rate could be reached by combining various aeration intermittencies and nozzle sizes. An attempt to suppress fouling without aeration was made by incorporating vibrations into a submerged hollow fibre membrane system. The effects of vibration frequency, type of yeast (washed and unwashed) on the filtration performance were observed. The impact of coagulant addition on filtration enhancement was also analysed. The performance of microfiltration was evaluated based on its critical flux value. The findings in this preliminary study indicated potential fouling control by applying vibrations to submerged membranes. A semi-empirical model was developed to predict the filtration behaviour by taking into account the bubble-induced shear and fibre movement. The predicted critical flux values suggested that membrane fouling appears to be more prominent at low air flowrate, with tight fibres, and higher feed concentrations. The model fits the experimental data with discrepancies from approximately 0.3% to 20%. The predicted filtration profiles at different operating modes demonstrate the importance of bubble-induced shear and fibre movement in the improvement of filtration performance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Membranes (Technology)</field><field name="subject">Bioreactors</field><field name="subject">Filtration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25998</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The recurrence of rhythm: configurations of the voice in homer, plato and joyce.</field><field name="creator">Martin, William, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Recurrence of Rhythm is an inquiry into the notion that the voice flows ??? a theme that continually recurs in the Homeric poems, Plato's Cratylus and James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Ulysses. Through a re-interpretation of the meaning of rhythmos in pre-Socratic philosophy, I define rhythm as the particular manner in which the voice is flowing, and argue that it is the specific quality of phonetic writing to represent the flowing aspect of the voice. The Greek concept of rhythmos is held to be inseparable from the invention of phonetic writing and the transcription of the Homeric poems, and it is this new definition of rhythm that allows the thesis to engage in contemporary debates concerning the relationship between speech and writing (as developed by Derrida, Ong, Havelock, Parry, Lord and Prier). I also argue that the Platonic concept of rhythm qua metre provides an essential point of mediation between the Greek oral tradition and the history of Western literature, a move that sets the scene for a comparative study of Homer and Joyce. By developing an original concept of recurrence that pertains to both the repetition of themes in the Homeric poems and the heroic experience of living for the sake of the story, this thesis proposes that rhythm and recurrence are interrelated concepts that distinguish the lyrical and dramatic modes that structure the epic form of narrative found in both Homer's poems and Joyce's novels. Drawing upon the esthetic philosophy of Stephen Dedalus, I develop the dialectical theory of genre first outlined by Joyce in the Paris notebook, and argue that the latent lyricism contained in the narrative style of A Portrait is a proto-typical form of the interior monologue found in Ulysses. In opposition to the early modernist paradigm of Joyce criticism, this thesis rejects the notion that mythic archetypes function as Platonic ideals (i.e. the transcendent form of the modernist artwork), but rather holds that heroic themes recur in the mental stream of the modern subject, and manifest themselves immediately through Joyce???s use of the interior monologue technique.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rhythm</field><field name="subject">Homer</field><field name="subject">Plato</field><field name="subject">Joyce, James, 1882-1941</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and fracture behaviour of graded alumina/epoxy joins</field><field name="creator">Rutgers, Lyndal, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction of a composition gradient at a join between two materials of different elastic properties should reduce the stress concentrating effect of the interfacial discontinuity. A crack oriented perpendicular to this elasticity gradient will experience mode-mixity, and possible subsequent crack deflection. Explicit analytical solutions for the stress state at the tip of an angled crack in a graded material of a given finite geometry do not exist, and ongoing crack path development in such a gradient has not been characterised. An infiltration processing technique is developed which allows two materials to be joined through a region of graded composition, of tailored width and composition profile. Composition discontinuities at layer interfaces in a stepped gradient can be tolerated due to the resulting interpenetrating network structured (INS) microstructure. Firing stresses were found to be a limitation of the processing technique, overcome by limiting the steepness of the elastic gradient. Alumina and epoxy resin graded composites were produced and tested under monotonic loading, resulting in stable crack path evolution. Stress-field asymmetry at the tip of a crack oriented perpendicular to an elastic gradient was demonstrated, followed by subsequent crack deflection. Stress intensity factor and deflection angle increase with increasing gradient steepness. Rising R-curve behaviour was demonstrated for all compositions of the INS composite, with initiation and plateau toughness decreasing with increasing epoxy content. Evidence of crack bridging by intact ligaments of the epoxy phase in the crack wake explains this behaviour. Crack deflection towards the epoxy region was anticipated and demonstrated for all gradient configurations. An increase in relative crack depth was seen to increase mode-mixity at the crack-tip and subsequent crack deflection, up to a relative depth of ~0.5.  No conclusive evidence was found for the influence of crack bridging on crack deflection. Toughness was shown to increase with the inclusion of a microstructural gradient. Measured toughness within graded samples was shown to be controlled by both the local composition and the volume of bridging ligaments in the crack wake. The optimum gradient should ??? extend over the widest region practical, ??? encompass the widest composition range possible, and ??? demonstrate extrinsic crack extension toughening.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adhesive joints</field><field name="subject">Fracture mechanics</field><field name="subject">Aluminium alloys</field><field name="subject">Epoxy compounds</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indoor air quality and post-disaster public housing: a case study of a Japanese post-disaster public housing on the effect of VOC emissions from building materials</field><field name="creator">Hirota, Keiko, School of Architecture, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since the beginning of the 20th century indoor air has produced distinctive pollution problems. The most critical pollutants in relation to indoor air quality (IAQ) are chemical contaminants which, in the form of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), have been identified as arising mainly from building materials. Conventional solutions such as ventilation systems and bake-out processes have been developed, but the IAQ problem, often reported as sick building syndrome (SBS), still persists. This study set out to establish to what extent VOCs may affect the health of occupants in a particular built environment, and how much architectural design factors, the use of particular building materials, and human activities may contribute to the problem of SBS. A further question was to establish to what extent current attempted solutions to IAQ problems, namely ventilation and bake-out, were in practice effective in a specific built environment. While previous research and attempted solutions have focused on work places as areas of concern for SBS, the problem is especially significant in residential housing and is particularly concentrated in post-disaster public housing (PDPH). For this reason the research was based on the case of a PDPH project in Abuta, Japan. To analyse the separate components of the problem, several distinct studies were undertaken. The level of pollutants in the air was analysed by means of chemical sampling of VOCs in two units of the PDPH, while the a SBS survey and assessment of the residents of the entire project, as well as interviews with the building professionals involved was designed to identify the human causes and effects of the situation. The effectiveness of the attempted solutions to the problem were considered by means of a study of the bake-out procedure, and finally an airflow simulation by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was conducted to consider the design and ventilation features of the units in relation to IAQ. The study results have indicated that IAQ problems existed after the completion of construction. It was found that certain VOC levels were far above the guidelines, and the health hazard symptoms known for these VOCs matched the SBS symptoms found in participants??? health complaints. Interviews with building professionals involved in the project revealed that the lifestyles of the occupants were not seriously considered in the project design. The results of the airflow simulation also revealed problematic aspects of the planning design, exacerbating rather than limiting the pollution problem as intended. The study concludes with a number of recommendations for taking these inter-related aspects of the problem into consideration in future, so that the health of residents is not adversely affected.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sick building syndrome</field><field name="subject">Indoor air pollution</field><field name="subject">Housing and health - Japan</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design automation methodologies for extensible processor platform</field><field name="creator">Cheung, Newton, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses two ubiquitous trends in the embedded system world - the increasing importance of design turnaround time as a design metric, and the move towards closing the design productivity gap. Adopting the right choice of design approach has been recognised as an integral part of the design flow in order to meet desired characteristics such as increasing software content, satisfying the growing complexities of an application, reusing off-the-shelf components, and exploring design metrics tradeoff, which closes the design productivity gap. The importance of design turnaround time is motivated by the intensive competition between manufacturers, especially makers of mainstream electronic consumer products, who shrinks the product life cycle and requires faster time-to-market to maximise economic benefits.  This thesis presents a suite of design automation methodologies to automatically design embedded systems for an application in the state-of-the-art design approach - the extensible processor platform. These design automation methodologies systematise the extensible processor platform???s design flow, with particular emphasis on solving four challenging design problems: i) code segment identification; ii) instruction generation; iii) architectural customisation selection; and iv) processor evaluation.  Our suite of design automation methodologies includes: i) a semi-automatic design system - to design an extensible processor that maximises the application performance while satisfying the area constraint. By specifying a fitting function to identify suitable code segments within an application, a two-level hierarchy selection algorithm is used to first select a predefined processor and then select the right instruction, and a performance estimator is used to estimate an application's performance; ii) a tool to match instructions - to automatically match the pre-designed instructions with computationally intensive code segments, reducing verification time and effort; iii) an instructions estimation model - to estimate the area overhead, latency, power consumption of extensible instructions, exploring larger design space; and iv) an instructions generation tool - to generate new extensible instructions that maximises the speedup while minimising power dissipation. A number of techniques such as system decomposition, combinational equivalence checking and regression analysis etc., have been heavily relied upon in the creation of the final design system. This thesis shows results at every stage to demonstrate the efficacy of our design methodologies in the creation of extensible processors. The methodologies and results presented in this thesis demonstrate that automating the design process for an extensible processor platform results in significant performance increase - on average, an increase of 4.74x (up to 15.71x) compared to the original base processor. Our system achieves significant design turnaround time savings (2.5% of the full simulation time for the entire design space) with majority Pareto points obtained (91% on average), and can lead to fewer and faster design iterations. Our instruction matching tool is 7.3x faster on average compared to the best known approaches to the problem (partial simulations). Our estimation model has a mean absolute error as small as 3.4% (6.7% max.) for area overhead, 5.9% (9.4% max.) for latency, and 4.2% (7.2% max.) for power consumption, compared to estimation through the time consuming synthesis and simulation steps using commercial tools. Finally, the instruction generation tool reduces energy consumption by a further 5.8% on average (up to 17.7%) compared to extensible instructions generated by previous approaches.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="subject">design and construction</field><field name="subject">integrated circuits</field><field name="subject">design automation</field><field name="subject">extensible processor</field><field name="subject">application specific instruction-set processor (ASIP)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards an integrated sustainability assessment of the built environment : the convergence of ecological footprint and spatial analysis to map the urban dynamics of a city.</field><field name="creator">Kumar, Arvind, School of the Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research examines ways to assess the built environment (BE) for its impacts on the ecosystems and its sustainability in terms of social, economic and environmental aspects on an urban scale. The examination is based on the argument, acknowledged in the literature, that urbanisation is one of the leading causes of unsustainable development, and that the BE makes a significant contribution to this. In order to accomplish this, urban dynamics are identified and mapped with respect to the built environment, and the relationship between urbanisation, the built environment, and the ecosystem is closely examined. The thesis argues that the common denominator in all efforts to move closer to sustainability is an effective assessment method, which not only quantifies the impacts but also informs and educates. The current methods used for assessment of the impacts of BE are found to be inadequate. An appraisal of contemporary assessment methods addressing sustainability and environmental issues at micro (individual building) and macro (urban system) levels is conducted to understand the mechanics of assessment theories. Based on this, a framework for a new assessment system which has the potential to overcome some of the observed weaknesses of the existing ones is proposed. Using multi-criteria analysis principles, this system uses ecological footprint and spatial analysis as its operational engine. It is then applied to a part of the Sydney Central Business District (CBD) for an integrated sustainability assessment. The ecological footprint of the building stock, transport, roads, waste disposal and water supply is calculated as a measure of the environmental impact of the built environment. In addition to this, ???return on investment??? (rental return on construction costs) as a measure of the economic aspect, embodied energy as a measure of material consumption, and ???proximity to facilities??? as a measure of the social benefit of the building stock, are calculated to assess the study area performance on these aspects. These are used to compute an integrated sustainability index for the study area. Various attributes of the built environment, such as total constructed area, height of building, road density etc., are analysed against the ecological footprint to understand the patterns of relationships between urban morphology and the state of sustainability.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable development</field><field name="subject">City planning - Environmental aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kynurenine pathway metabolism at the blood-brain barrier</field><field name="creator">Owe-Young, Robert, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">A major product of HIV-infected and cytokine-stimulated monocytic-lineage cells is quinolinic acid (QUIN), a neurotoxic metabolite of the kynurenine pathway (KP) of L-tryptophan (L-Trp) metabolism. Despite the large number of neurotoxins found in HIV patients with AIDS Dementia Complex (ADC), only QUIN correlates with both the presence and severity of ADC. With treatment, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) QUIN concentrations decrease proportionate to the degree of clinical and neuropsychological improvement. As endothelial cells (EC) of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are the first brain-associated cell that a bloodborne pathogen would encounter, this project examined the BBB response to KP metabolites, as these are implicated in damage of the CNS associated with ADC. Using RT-PCR and HPLC/gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS), I found that cultured primary human BBB EC and pericytes constitutively expressed the KP. EC synthesised kynurenic acid (KA) constitutively, and after immune activation, kynurenine (KYN). Pericytes produced small amounts of picolinic acid and after immune activation, KYN. An SV40-transformed BBB EC showed no KP expression. By contrast, human umbilical vein EC only expressed low levels of KA after immune activation, however human dermal microvascular EC showed a similar constitutive and inducible KP to that in BBB EC. As T cells are central to primary HIV infection, I also examined KP expression in two CD4+ and one CD4- cell lines, but none showed either constitutive or inducible KP expression. I next examined how QUIN might interact with BBB EC. There was no binding of 3H-QUIN to cultured primary human BBB EC, however a biologically relevant concentration of QUIN induced changes in gene expression which adversely affected EC function, possibly mediated by lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. The upregulated genes were of the heat shock protein family, and the downregulated genes were associated with regulation of cell adhesion, tight junction and cytoskeletal stability, metalloproteinase (MMP) regulation, apoptosis and G protein signaling. Immunofluorescence showed that QUIN induced morphological changes in BBB EC consistent with the changes in gene expression. Gelatin zymography showed that this was not mediated by MMPs, as constitutive MMP expression was unchanged. These data provide strong evidence for QUIN directly damaging the BBB in the context of HIV infection.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kynurenine - Metabolism</field><field name="subject">Blood-brain barrier</field><field name="subject">AIDS dementia complex - Pathogenesis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26183</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The control of bone formation by neuropeptide Y receptors</field><field name="creator">Alison, Susan Jean, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Osteoporosis is a growing health concern, characterised by deterioration of bone and increased fracture incidence. Anabolic treatments for reversing bone loss are presently limited. A bone anabolic response was recently reported following deletion of hypothalamic neuropeptide Y2 receptors in mice. In contrast, no discernable bone phenotype was observed in Y4 receptor knockout (Y4-/-) mice, revealing specificity between the Y receptors in their control of bone formation. Studies in this thesis revealed a second anabolic response in the absence of another Y receptor subtype; the Y1 receptor. The potential interaction between the Y1 and Y2- anabolic pathways with each other and with Y4 was investigated through the generation of mouse models lacking multiple Y receptor subtypes. Interestingly, no synergistic elevation in bone volume was observed in Y1-/-Y2-/- double knockout mice, indicative of shared mechanisms of action. In contrast, the synergistic elevation in bone volume of male Y2-/- Y4-/- mice was likely due to additive effects of leptin signalling. Consequentially, potential interaction between Y receptors and leptin was investigated by crossing the Y receptor knockouts onto the leptin deficient ob/ob background, revealing differential responses of the Y receptor pathways to leptin deficiency, with the anabolic response of the Y2-/- model retained in Y2-/-/ob mice but abolished in Y1-/-/ob mice compared to Y1-/-. Differential responses of these two pathways were also revealed following gonadectomy of Y1-/- and Y2-/- mice. Importantly, these studies also demonstrated the ability of the central Y2- anabolic pathway to halt gonadectomy-induced bone loss. Interestingly, cultured stromal cells from germline Y2-/- mice exhibited an enhanced ability to undergo mineralisation and adipocyte differentiation, associated with a greater number of mesenchymal progenitor cells present within the bone of Y2-/- mice, suggesting a potential mechanism for the greater mineralisation of the Y2-/- model in vitro and in vivo. Y1 receptor expression was also detected in stromal cells from wild type mice, but was nearly abolished in Y2-/- mice. Together these findings demonstrate an important therapeutic potential for these pathways in the treatment of osteoporosis and indicate that modulation of Y receptor signalling within the bone microenvironment may alter proportions of mesenchymal progenitor populations with effects on bone formation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bone</field><field name="subject">Neuropeptide Y</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Retroelements as controlling elements in mammals</field><field name="creator">Thomson, Gabrielle Anne, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Retroelements are genomic parasites which make up ~42% of the human genome and 38% of the mouse genome.  Most are degenerate, but a large number have relatively intact promoter elements, suggesting that they are capable of transcription.  Transcriptionally active retroelements can perturb normal transcription units in their vicinity through a variety of mechanisms, leading to phenotypic effects and in some cases disease.  This phenomenon of transcriptional interference has been observed in organisms as diverse as maize, Drosophila, and the mouse.  We analysed the extent of retroelement transcription in normal and diseased tissues, by searching the mouse and human EST databases for transcripts originating in retroelement promoters, and found a large number of transcripts from LINEs, SINEs and ERVs.  Retroelement transcripts were found to be initiated in both sense and antisense orientations, and to be equally as common in normal and diseased tissue.  Several of these transcripts were chimeric, appearing to initiate in retroelements and reading through to cellular genes, suggestive of transcriptional interference.  We have used transposon display to identify and recover retroelement transcripts in the mouse.  Transcripts initiated in LINE, SINE and ERV promoters are numerous, and many are chimeric with cellular genes.  Although the numbers of recovered chimeric transcripts are too large to permit rigorous analysis of more than a small proportion, some of those we have studied further appear to be authentic transcripts that may represent interference with the canonical promoters of the genes in question.  Our results suggest that transcriptional interference by retroelements may be a relatively common occurrence in mammals.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">retroelement</field><field name="subject">transcriptional interference</field><field name="subject">chimeric transcripts</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Statistical analysis of central aortic blood pressure parameters derived from the peripheral pulse</field><field name="creator">Camacho, Fernando, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">With the rise in prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) disease, risk stratification is becoming increasingly important. Accurate characterization of the CV system is required, for which central aortic blood pressure (BP) parameters form an integral part. However, invasive measurement of central aortic BP parameters (aP) is difficult. Therefore, non-invasive methods to estimate aP from the radial pressure pulse (rPulse) have been proposed.  To analyze accuracy of estimated aP (aPhat) and applicability in risk stratification and diagnosis, this study presents: (1) a novel representation of the rPulse with minimal loss of information, (2) a framework for strict definition and statistical analysis of aPhat, and (3) a dynamic analysis of effects of mean BP (MP) and heart rate (HR) in the rPulse shape.  Methods: (1) 2671 rPulse s measured by applanation tonometry were represented using the first eight principal components (PC) scores after standard PC transformation. rPulse shapes were compared in three subpopulations. (2) The concept of &amp;quotestimation option&amp;quot (EO) for aP estimation was presented. A framework for strict definition of aPhat and the comparison of EOs was proposed, and 7 different EOs compared. (3) A sequence of rPulse s was analyzed during soft exhalation maneuver (SEM) %, a mild Valsalva type maneuver, in eight healthy subjects. Radial BP and respiration pressure were continuously measured. The effects of MP and HR in the rPulse parameters were analyzed by standard linear regression for each subject.  Results: (1) PC representation of the rPulse improves accuracy of the estimation of aPhat compared with the simple use of rPulse parameters. Subpopulations have distinctive rPulse shapes. (2) No single EO was better for the estimation of all aPhat. Inclusion of MP improves estimation accuracy. Despite further improvement when rPulse is included, the general transfer function EO is a biased estimator. (3) The dynamic analysis of the rPulse provides information of the effects of MP and HR in the rPulse not available in static analysis. The effects were specific for each individual and different from the results obtained from a general population.  Conclusions: For accurate CV risk stratification, future studies should include a dynamic measurement of calibrated radial pressure pulse during SEM maneuver. Risk analysis and diagnosis should be based on representations of the rPulse with minimum loss of information. aPhat should be used for better understanding of the underlying physiological principles.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cardiovascular</field><field name="subject">blood pressure</field><field name="subject">statistical</field><field name="subject">central aortic</field><field name="subject">peripheral pulse</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26215</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Pt and Ag metals to the degradation of trichloroethylene, ethylene, ethane, and toluene by gas phase photocatalysis</field><field name="creator">Djongkah, Cissillia Young, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The photocatalytic oxidation of trichloroethylene (TCE), ethylene. ethane and toluene on TiO2, Pt/TiO2 and Ag/TiO2 were investigated in a dedicated reactor set-up operated at room temperature and ambient pressure condition. The gas phase experiments were carried out for both single and binary mixtures of these chemicals to identify the role of Pt and Ag metallisation in the photocatalytic oxidation of different contaminants. In a single contaminant system, the presence of Pt enhanced the oxidation of ethylene, ethane and toluene but detrimental to the oxidation of TCE. In the oxidation of ethylene, Pt enhanced the oxidation by acting as catalyst and as electron sink. However, in ethane oxidation, the enhancement was solely associated to the ability of Pt to act as electron sink. The detrimental effect observed in TCE oxidation was attributed to Pt and Cl interaction, which formed a persistent inorganic chlorine species decreasing the overall Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst performance. Interestingly, Ag did not show any significant effect to the oxidation of any single system degradation. In binary system degradation, where TCE and another organic compound either ethylene, ethane or toluene were degraded simultaneously, Pt always caused a detrimental effect due to its strong interaction with Cl. However, the presence of Ag and Cl gives a more synergetic effect. Ag was found to provide sites to temporarily trap chlorine radicals as AgCl. Under illumination, electrons transferred from Cl to Ag forming chlorine radicals that could react with the surface contaminant enhancing its breakdown and mineralization.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Photocatalysis</field><field name="subject">metal doping</field><field name="subject">Ag</field><field name="subject">Pt</field><field name="subject">Toluene</field><field name="subject">TCE</field><field name="subject">Ethylene</field><field name="subject">Ethane</field><field name="subject">UV</field><field name="subject">Deactivation</field><field name="subject">Binary mixture</field><field name="subject">catalysis</field><field name="subject">Chlorine.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Incremental knowledge acquisition for natural language processing</field><field name="creator">Pham, Son Bao, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Linguistic patterns have been used widely in shallow methods to develop numerous NLP applications. Approaches for acquiring linguistic patterns can be broadly categorised into three groups: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and manual methods. In supervised learning approaches, a large annotated training corpus is required for the learning algorithms to achieve decent results. However, annotated corpora are expensive to obtain and usually available only for established tasks. Unsupervised learning approaches usually start with a few seed examples and gather some statistics based on a large unannotated corpus to detect new examples that are similar to the seed ones. Most of these approaches either populate lexicons for predefined patterns or learn new patterns for extracting general factual information; hence they are applicable to only a limited number of tasks. Manually creating linguistic patterns has the advantage of utilising an expert's knowledge to overcome the scarcity of annotated data. In tasks with no annotated data available, the manual way seems to be the only choice. One typical problem that occurs with manual approaches is that the combination of multiple patterns, possibly being used at different stages of processing, often causes unintended side effects. Existing approaches, however, do not focus on the practical problem of acquiring those patterns but rather on how to use linguistic patterns for processing text. A systematic way to support the process of manually acquiring linguistic patterns in an efficient manner is long overdue. This thesis presents KAFTIE, an incremental knowledge acquisition framework that strongly supports experts in creating linguistic patterns manually for various NLP tasks. KAFTIE addresses difficulties in manually constructing knowledge bases of linguistic patterns, or rules in general, often faced in existing approaches by: (1) offering a systematic way to create new patterns while ensuring they are consistent; (2) alleviating the difficulty in choosing the right level of generality when creating a new pattern; (3) suggesting how existing patterns can be modified to improve the knowledge base's performance; (4) making the effort in creating a new pattern, or modifying an existing pattern, independent of the knowledge base's size. KAFTIE, therefore, makes it possible for experts to efficiently build large knowledge bases for complex tasks. This thesis also presents the KAFDIS framework for discourse processing using new representation formalisms: the level-of-detail tree and the discourse structure graph.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge acquisition (Expert systems)</field><field name="subject">Natural language processing (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Computational linguistics</field><field name="subject">Semantics - Data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26299</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public health impact of contact lens related microbial keratitis</field><field name="creator">Keay, Lisa Jane, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the impact of contact lens-related microbial keratitis in terms of incidence and severity.  Disease outcome is defined by visual outcome, costs to the healthcare system, costs to the individual and duration of disease.   A successful 12-month surveillance study was conducted of the populations of Australia and New Zealand to detect all cases of contact lens-related microbial keratitis.  A random telephone survey of 32,000 households in Australia and 7,500 in New Zealand accurately determined the level of use of various contact lenses in the community.  The impact of new contact lens types: silicone hydrogels and daily disposables were investigated.  Increased risk persisted in overnight wear with silicone hydrogel materials.  Microbial keratitis associated with silicone hydrogel materials had slightly shorter disease duration however other factors had a stronger influence on severity.  Rigid gas permeable and frequent replacement soft lenses when used for daily wear constitute the lowest risk. Cost analysis was developed in a hospital case series of microbial keratitis.  This analysis was applied in the surveillance study including cases managed in the private health care sector.  Disease duration and associated costs are novel indices of severity for contact lens-related disease. The most dramatic effects on disease severity were seen with the type of organism involved.  Keratitis attributed to environmental organisms (Gram-negative bacteria, Acanthamoeba, fungi and Nocardia species) were 10x more likely to cause loss of visual acuity, had longer duration of symptoms and incurred higher costs.  Importantly, delays in receiving treatment increased disease duration and associated costs.  Greater awareness of the need for specialist healthcare is indicated amongst health care providers and contact lens wearers.  The hypothesis that overnight wear in silicone hydrogel lenses would not increase the risk of infection has been disproven.  This information is of value to practitioners who are responsible for informing contact lens wearers about the risk of contact lens-related infections and should be weighed against the benefits of continuous wear.  The identification of factors which contribute to the outcomes of disease will be used in education campaigns amongst health care providers and contact lens wearers to minimise the impact of disease.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microbial keratitis</field><field name="subject">cost analysis</field><field name="subject">vision loss</field><field name="subject">silicone hydrogel</field><field name="subject">incidence</field><field name="subject">contact lens</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DSM-IV alcohol use disorders in Australia: validity, prevalence and treatment seeking</field><field name="creator">Proudfoot, Heather, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Alcohol use disorders are common and make a significant contribution to the burden of disease throughout the world. This is especially true among the younger age groups. Although these disorders are common, evidence suggests that those affected do not seek help for their disorders. In order to understand this, reviews of the treatment literature and the epidemiological data on prevalence and correlates of alcohol use disorders and treatment seeking are presented. These reviews confirm that effective treatments exist and that screening in primary care can be efficacious. The reviews also highlight deficits such as the need for more epidemiological evidence on the validity of DSM definitions of alcohol use disorders and for more Australian data on the prevalence and correlates of the disorders and related treatment seeking. This thesis sets out to address these deficits applying sophisticated statistical techniques to data from a large nationally representative Australian sample. A confirmatory factor analysis of the eleven criteria that specify alcohol dependence and abuse examined the validity of DSM-IV definitions of alcohol use disorders and the best solution was found to be a single factor, not two as currently defined. These findings question the bi-axial nature of alcohol use disorders that has underpinned their definition since the publication of DSM-III-R in 1987. Data from this national sample also confirm that, in line with research from other western countries, Australians have high levels of alcohol use disorders, especially amongst males and younger people. Also no association was found between alcohol dependence and treatment seeking, and young people were least likely to seek treatment. However, a relatively large proportion of young people who drink had been in contact with their GPs in the past year; demonstrating that there is ample opportunity for screening and referral for treatment for alcohol use disorders in this vulnerable group.  This research has found that although alcohol disorders are not necessarily associated with disability, there are those who can benefit from treatment. It suggests that outcomes for such individuals may be improved by better specification of disorders as well as improved access to best treatments.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alcoholism -- Diagnosis.</field><field name="subject">Alcoholism -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Alcoholism -- Australia -- Psychological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Alcoholism -- Treatment -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whose values shape social policy?:  policy process limits to economic rationalism:  Australian coordinated care policy 1994 to 2001.</field><field name="creator">Fisher, Karen Raewyn, Social Policy Research Centre, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses a significant gap in Australian social policy literature about the relationship between the impact of economic rationalism on social policy and interest representation during policy implementation. Michael Pusey, for instance, argues that economic rationalism displaces social values in social policy. However, other theorists, such as Robert Alford and Rod Rhodes, caution that policy often changes when it is implemented. With a foundation in Weberian social theory about participant values, the analytical framework incorporates three institutional policy implementation concepts to capture the dynamic characteristics of the policy process. These are: policy stages to describe policy change over time; structural interests of policy organisations; and policy networks within which participants act. The thesis tests this framework to explain the impact of values of economic rationality in the Australian coordinated care policy. The policy attempted to coordinate the care of people with chronic care needs, using a funds pool, case managers and care plans. The research methods are interviews with policy participants; analysis of public documents; and participant observation as an evaluator in one trial. Data about the policy process from 1994 to 2001 are analysed with a critical interpretive approach. The study reveals that central agency officials acted primarily on values of economic rationality. In contrast, health agency officials acted primarily on organisational values. The transfer of responsibility for the policy process from a central agency to the health agency after the policy statements reinforced health provider organisational interests, rather than either the rationalist interests of central agencies or the social interests of consumer groups. The policy consequently changed away from economic rationality. The policy process in the planning, implementation and revision stages was in no sense an instrumental application of the values of economic rationality apparent in the policy statements stage. Neither, however, did social values predominate in any policy stage.  The study argues that insights from policy implementation research can refine the literature on economic rationalism. This research further advances policy network theory. It recognises that understanding which organisation is responsible for the policy, at various policy stages, advances our understanding of whose values shape social policy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social policy -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Economic policy -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40783</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust solutions for constraint satisfaction and optimisation under uncertainty.</field><field name="creator">Hebrard, Emmanuel, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">We develop a framework for finding robust solutions of constraint programs. Our approach is based on the notion of fault tolerance. We formalise this concept within constraint programming, extend it in several dimensions and introduce some algorithms to find robust solutions efficiently.  When applying constraint programming to real world problems we often face uncertainty. Whilst reactive methods merely deal with the consequences of an unexpected change, taking a more proactive approach may guarantee a certain level of robustness. We propose to apply the fault tolerance framework, introduced in [Ginsberg 98], to constraint programming: A robust solution is one such that a small perturbation only requires a small response. We identify, define and classify a number of abstract problems related to stability within constraint satisfaction or optimisation. We propose some efficient and effective algorithms for solving these problems. We then extend this framework by allowing the repairs and perturbations themselves to be constrained.

However there are numerous challenges to managing the asset. Firstly, there is no universally accepted measure of biodiversity per se. As a consequence, rather than measuring the intrinsic value of biodiversity the focus has typically shifted to valuing biodiversity services. Secondly, biodiversity issues should not be considered in a vacuum, but rather alongside general natural resource management problems. Conservation agencies and regulators alike would greatly benefit from more transparent biodiversity targets for conservation policies and natural resource management. This thesis makes a number of contributions to meet these challenges including measuring biodiversity, modelling diverse ecosystems and considering biodiversity outcomes in the management of an environmental resource. To value biodiversity, it is essential to measure it. Focusing on pairwise genetic dissimilarities at the species level, this thesis develops two models for measuring biodiversity. An axiomatic diagnosis of the existing and new measures is presented. This comparison suggests that the adequate biodiversity measure depends on the context. The diversity measures describe the biodiversity catalogue available at a given point in time. Modelling biodiversity is important for forecasting the impact of conservation decisions and understanding the future value of biodiversity. The importance of each species, however, depends on its role in the ecosystem as well as its genetic diversity. The interactions between species are therefore investigated and described, using a new model built around CES production functions. Three existing models based on predator-prey equations are extended to the multi-species case. These interaction models provide the necessary link for biodiversity maintenance over time. The four models are compared using simulations and an axiomatic approach. This approach shows that the new model performs well, offers the flexibility required to describe different types of ecosystems and is less data intensive. Finally, a case study of natural resource exploitation is presented, illustrating the idea that biodiversity loss can have direct economic implications in natural resource management. The model shows the impact of market structures on the extraction path of the resource and the distribution of the resource rent.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biodiversity.</field><field name="subject">Environmental economics.</field><field name="subject">Ecosystem management.</field><field name="subject">Biological diversity -- Economic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Sustainable development.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26796</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The study of pretreatment options for composite fouling of reverse osmosis membranes used in water treatment and production</field><field name="creator">Mustafa, Ghulam Mohammad, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Most common inorganic foulants in RO processes operating on brackish water are calcium carbonate, calcium sulphate and silica. However, silica fouling is the recovery limiting factor in RO system. Silica chemistry is complex and its degree of fouling strongly depends on the silica solubility and its polymerization under different operating conditions of RO process. In several studies carried out in batch and dynamic tests, the presence of polyvalent cations and supersaturation of silica in solutions were found to be the important factors (apart from pH and temperature) that affected the rate of silica polymerization and its induction period. Agitation did increased silica solubility; however, its effect was negligible in presence of polyvalent cations. Alkalization of water solution by coagulants particularly sodium hydroxide was found suitable for silica removal during pretreatment. The presence of magnesium in solution played a key role in silica removal mostly by the mechanism of adsorption to the metal hydroxide. The options of inline mixing (high agitation) for 5 to 10 minutes and microfiltration before RO were found suitable for silica pretreatment. During dynamic tests, the most dominant mechanism for salt deposition (mostly CaSO4) was particulate type in high concentration water solution; while crystallization fouling was the prevailing mechanism of deposition (mostly CaCO3 and silica) in low concentration solution. Silica showed significant effect on size and shape of inorganic salt crystals during coprecipitation. Moreover, the presence of common antiscalants promoted silica fouling. This important finding recommends an extra caution while using antiscalants in case feed water contains silica to a level that can attain saturation near membrane during RO process. A model was developed to predict the silica fouling index (SFI) based on the experimental data for induction period of silica polymerization. The model takes into account the effect of polyvalent cations and concentration polarization near membrane during RO process. It provides a conservative basis for predicting the maximum silica deposition in RO process at the normal operating conditions. A generalised correlation, which was developed for determination of the mass transfer coefficient in RO process, incorporated the effect of temperature change that is usually not considered in previous correlations. A correlation for reduction of silica content in feed water, down to a safe limit of 15 ppm for RO process, was also formulated and validated by the experimental results.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Silica fouling.</field><field name="subject">Silica polymerization.</field><field name="subject">Desalination.</field><field name="subject">Membranes.</field><field name="subject">Pretreatment.</field><field name="subject">Saline water conversion -- Reverse osmosis process.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40882</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecological effects of sealed roads in arid ecosystems</field><field name="creator">Lee, Enhua, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The effects of roads on landscapes and wildlife and their ecological processes are substantial and represent a major anthropogenic disruption to the natural environment. Current understanding of the impacts of roads for their strategic management is hampered by a lack of information on 1) the influence of the ecosystems on road effects, 2) the effects of roads on higher-order ecosystem responses (populations and communities), and 3) the overall impacts of roads on ecosystems and their wildlife (on both abiotic and biotic ecosystem components). This study used the Silver City Highway in arid New South Wales, Australia, as a model for a typical road in an arid ecosystem to investigate the ecological effects of arid-zone roads and their management. The study examined the spatial variation of soil, vegetation, kangaroo and small mammal variables in relation to the road, explored the factors contributing to these respective spatial variations, investigated the effects of arid-zone road management on vegetation, assessed the fragmentation effect of the arid-zone road on small mammals, and determined the patterns, causes and effects of kangaroo-vehicle collisions. The study revealed that the arid-zone road influenced most of the variables measured, skewed the population demographics of two kangaroo species, and altered the community composition of small mammals, with two small mammal species listed as threatened in NSW and of national significance (Sminthopsis macroura and Leggadina forresti) negatively impacted by the road. Increases in the amount of water along the road edge drove many of the subsequent effects of the arid-zone road as arid-zone flora and fauna are adapted to exploiting limited and patchily distributed resources. However, current arid-zone road management also influenced vegetation quality, microclimates around the road influenced kangaroo densities and small mammal communities, and kangaroo flight behaviour and temporal variations in traffic volume affected roadkill frequency. Together, these results suggest that roads have a high overall ecological impact in arid ecosystems. Conservation managers need to first rank the impacts of arid-zone roads in order of their conservation importance and need for mitigation, and from there, devise relevant informed management frameworks to target these impacts.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arid regions ecology - New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Arid regions animals - New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Roads - Environmental aspects - New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Silver City Highway (N.S.W.)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26265</field></doc><doc><field name="title">James Brown: apprehending a minor temporality.</field><field name="creator">Scannell, John, School of Media, Film &amp; Theatre, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with popular music's working of time. It takes the experience of time as crucial to the negotiation of social, political or, more simply, existential, conditions. The key example analysed is the funk style invented by legendary musician James Brown. I argue that James Brown's funk might be understood as an apprehension of a minor temporality or the musical expression of a particular form of negotiation of time by a minor culture. Precursors to this idea are found in the literature of the stream of consciousness style and, more significantly for this thesis, in the work of philosopher Gilles Deleuze on the cinema in his books Cinema 1: The Movement-Image and Cinema 2: The Time-Image. These examples are all concerned with the indeterminate unfolding of lived time and where the reality of temporal indeterminacy will take precedence over the more linear conventions of traditional narrative. Deleuze???s Cinema books account for such a shift in emphasis from the narrative depiction of movement through time the movement-image to a more direct experience of the temporal the time-image, and I will trace a similar shift in the history of popular music. For Deleuze, the change in the relation of images to time is catalysed by the intolerable events of World War II. In this thesis, the evolution of funk will be seen to reflect the existential change experienced by a generation of African-Americans in the wake of the civil-rights movement. The funk groove associated with the music of James Brown is discussed as an aesthetic strategy that responds to the existential conditions that grew out of the often perceived failure of the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Funk provided an aesthetic strategy that allowed for the constitution of a minor temporality, involving a series of temporal negotiations that eschew more hegemonic, common sense, compositions of time and space. This has implications for the understanding of much of the popular music that has followed funk. I argue that the understanding of the emergence of funk, and of the contemporary electronic dance music styles which followed, would be enhanced by taking this ontological consideration of the experiential time of minorities into account. I will argue that funk and the electronic dance musics that followed might be seen as articulations of minority expression, where the time-image style of their musical compositions reflect the post-soul eschewing of a narratively driven, common sense view of historical time.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Funk (Music) -- History and criticism.</field><field name="subject">Soul music -- History and criticism.</field><field name="subject">African American aesthetics.</field><field name="subject">Time in music.</field><field name="subject">Soul musicians -- United States.</field><field name="subject">Funk musicians -- United States.</field><field name="subject">African Americans in popular culture.</field><field name="subject">Music -- Philosophy and aesthetics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natural feature extraction as a front end for simultaneous localization and mapping.</field><field name="creator">Kiang, Kai-Ming, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with algorithms for finding natural features that are then used for simultaneous localisation and mapping, commonly known as SLAM in navigation theory. The task involves capturing raw sensory inputs, extracting features from these inputs and using the features for mapping and localising during navigation. The ability to extract natural features allows automatons such as robots to be sent to environments where no human beings have previously explored working in a way that is similar to how human beings understand and remember where they have been.  In extracting natural features using images, the way that features are represented and matched is a critical issue in that the computation involved could be wasted if the wrong method is chosen. While there are many techniques capable of matching pre-defined objects correctly, few of them can be used for real-time navigation in an unexplored environment, intelligently deciding on what is a relevant feature in the images.  Normally, feature analysis that extracts relevant features from an image is a 2-step process, the steps being firstly to select interest points and then to represent these points based on the local region properties. A novel technique is presented in this thesis for extracting a small enough set of natural features robust enough for navigation purposes. The technique involves a 3-step approach. The first step involves an interest point selection method based on extrema of difference of Gaussians (DOG). The second step applies Textural Feature Analysis (TFA) on the local regions of the interest points. The third step selects the distinctive features using Distinctness Analysis (DA) based mainly on the probability of occurrence of the features extracted. The additional step of DA has shown that a significant improvement on the processing speed is attained over previous methods. Moreover, TFA / DA has been applied in a SLAM configuration that is looking at an underwater environment where texture can be rich in natural features. The results demonstrated that an improvement in loop closure ability is attained compared to traditional SLAM methods. This suggests that real-time navigation in unexplored environments using natural features could now be a more plausible option.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SLAM (Computer program language)</field><field name="subject">Robot vision</field><field name="subject">Image processing -- Digital techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semiconductor oxide supported Mo and Mo-W carbide catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Tuan Huy, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction to produce sulphur free hydrocarbons has enjoyed a resurgent in interests due to increases in world oil prices. In this work, the suitability of Mo and Mo-W carbides has been investigated as a possible cost-effective alternative to noble metals in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The molybdenum and tungsten monometallic and bimetallic carbides were prepared through precipitation from homogeneous solution to the sulphide followed by carburization with a mixture of propane and hydrogen to produce the resulting metal carbide. A 23 factorial design strategy was employed to investigate the effect of three carburizing variables, namely, time, temperature and gas ratio on the resulting catalyst. In particular, the effect of supports was also examined through four common semiconductor oxide supports, namely: Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2. Thermogravimetric analysis of the carburization reactions showed that the conversion from metal sulphide to the metal carbides is a multistep process producing different phases of carbides, namely ??-MoC1-x, ??-Mo2C, ?? -WC1-x and ??-W2C, depending on heating rate and temperature. The rate determining step of the carburising reaction is the diffusion of carbon atoms into the metal matrix, hence giving relatively low activation energy values. Statistical analysis of the factorial design revealed that all three carburizing variables affect the final physiochemical makeup of the catalyst. SEM analysis showed that the carbides are well dispersed on the surface of the support and catalyst particles produced are nanoparticles in the range of 25 to 220 nm depending on the support. Fischer-Tropsch activity test showed that monometallic molybdenum carbide is active under Fischer-Tropsch conditions while tungsten carbide is inactive for the conditions studied in this project. However, bimetallic carbide catalyst, consisting of the two mentioned metals gave overall higher reaction rates and decreased methane selectivity. Steady state analysis revealed that there are two active sites on the surface of molybdenum carbide catalyst resulting in two chain growth propagation values when analysed via the Anderson-Schulz-Flory kinetics. Overall, ZrO2 support appeared to be the most suitable support followed by SiO2, TiO2 and Al2O3. Finally, kinetic modelling of data showed that methanation and higher hydrocarbons formation path occurs via combination of the oxygenated intermediate and Eley-Rideal mechanism.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fischer-Tropsch process</field><field name="subject">Catalysts -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">Carbides</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26969</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of ???environmental refugee??? protection at the United Nations</field><field name="creator">McNamara, Karen Elizabeth, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to better conceptualise how and why there is an absence of international protection for ???environmental refugees???, and to place these findings in the critical geopolitics literature. A poststructuralist framework, drawing on Foucault???s ideas of discourse, subjectivity, power and governance, was deemed most appropriate for this thesis, and provided a means of differentiation from previous literature on ???environmental refugees???. This thesis develops a genealogy of the subject category of ???environmental refugees??? since the 1970s, to better understand how the United Nations, Inter-Governmental Organisations (IGOs), Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and the media have constructed environmental issues and refugees in texts. Fieldwork undertaken in 2004 enabled me to conduct 45 semistructured interviews with United Nations diplomats and representatives from IGOs and NGOs. Critical scrutiny of these interview texts revealed the constructions of ???environmental refugees??? as various subject identities, particularly in relation to climate change. Pacific ambassadors to the United Nations were also interviewed in 2004 to explore how they negotiated discourses on climate change and ???environmental refugees???, and attempted to articulate their concerns at the United Nations. This thesis contends that an absence of policy at the United Nations to protect ???environmental refugees??? has been produced by a combination of discursive and institutional politics. Unequal power structures at the United Nations have limited the capacity of small island states to lobby and articulate concerns, while subject categories of ???environmental refugees??? have been constructed in ways that alter the terms of debate, evade legal response, or deflect blame away from the perpetrators of environmental damage. Reasons for this policy absence have been the shifting attitudes towards environmental issues and the role of multilateral political institutions. The overall contribution of this thesis is to critical geopolitics, through its examination of the role of multilateralism, representations of environmental issues causing population displacement, and how and why policy absences are created within multilateral institutions such as the United Nations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Refugees -- Protection</field><field name="subject">Refugees -- International cooperation</field><field name="subject">Human rights</field><field name="subject">Internally displaced persons</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immune regulation in mouse models of allergic asthma</field><field name="creator">Su, Yung-Chang, University of New South Wales &amp; Garvan Institute of Medical Research. St. Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Allergic asthma is an immunological disease, mediated by CD4+ Th2 cells, and its prevalence has increased over recent decades. Features of allergic asthma include airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), airway eosinophilia, excessive airway mucus production, and increased IgE and Th2 cytokine levels. Airway remodeling with pulmonary fibrosis is noted in the progress of asthma. In this thesis, a murine model of allergic asthma was used to investigate the effect of cyclophosphamide (CY) on asthma and the involvement of regulatory T cells (Treg), and the role of Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating-factor (GM-CSF) in allergic asthma by using GM-CSF knockout mice. CY is a cytotoxic agent, which paradoxically augments several immune responses. The first part of this thesis was aimed to study the effects of CY in a murine model of allergic airway inflammation. BALB/c mice were immunized with ovalbumin (OVA) on days 0 and 14, and challenged with aerosolized OVA from days 21 to 27. Some mice additionally received CY on days -2 and 12. In the CY-treated animals, pronounced worsening of inflammatory features was noted, including increases in eosinophil infiltration, epithelial thickness, mucus occlusion and eosinophil numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Increased total and OVA-specific serum IgE were also noted in the CY-treated animals. In cell cultures from peritracheal lymph nodes, the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 were elevated in animals treated with CY. It was hypothesized that the effects of CY could be caused by reduced immunosuppression mediated by Treg. mRNA expression of the immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta was reduced in the lungs of CY-treated mice. The expression of FoxP3, a marker of naturally occurring Treg, was significantly reduced in spleens, thymuses and peritracheal lymph nodes after the second injection of CY, and in the lung tissue after allergen challenge in CY-treated mice. Furthermore, lung IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells and CTLA-4+-bearing CD4+ T cells were reduced after allergen aerosol challenge in CY-treated mice. Thus CY worsened the features of allergic pulmonary inflammation in this model, in association with increased production of IgE and Th2 cytokines. The reduction in expression of FoxP3 and immunosuppressive cytokines by CY suggests that toxicity to Treg may contribute to the increased inflammation. GM-CSF plays a role in the growth, development, and maturation of bone marrow hemopoietic cells into mature blood cells, and has been proposed to be involved in potentiating the function of inflammatory cells in allergic inflammation. In the second part of this thesis, GM-CSF knockout (KO) mice were used to investigate the role of GM-CSF. In allergic KO mice, airway eosinophils were only shown in the perivascular, but not peribronchial areas in the lung, compared to the allergic wild-type (WT) mice in which eosinophil infiltration appeared in both areas. Eosinophil numbers were drastically reduced in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of KO mice. IL-5 production in the lung tissue and BALF in allergic KO mice was reduced; similar results were also found in peritracheal draining lymph nodes after in vitro stimulation assays. However, IL-4 and IL-13 production, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and serum IgE production were not affected in allergic KO mice. Surprisingly, lung IFN-gamma mRNA and BALF levels were increased in allergic KO mice. Lung mRNA levels of CCR3, a key chemokine receptor on eosinophils, were significantly reduced in allergic KO mice, whereas expression of the chemokines eotaxin and RANTES were at similar levels in allergic KO and WT mice. Lung mRNA levels of the IFN-gamma-inducible chemokines Mig (CXCL9) and IP-10 (CXCL10), which are antagonists of CCR3, and their receptor CXCR3 were increased in allergic KO mice, compared with allergic WT mice. Data obtained from flow cytometry showed more eosinophils survived in the lung of WT mice than KO mice. Another allergy model, a peritoneal allergy model was performed to investigate inflammation in a different model. Leukocyte subpopulations such as neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes were reduced in the peritoneal lavage fluid of allergic KO mice. The findings revealed that GM-CSF is essential for IL-5 production, pulmonary airway eosinophilia and eosinophil survival. In the absence of GM-CSF, over-production of IFN-???? may induce chemokines, including Mig and IP-10, which are antagonists for CCR3 and may reduce airway eosinophil infiltration. In this thesis, a murine model of allergic asthma has been used to obtain novel findings on the regulation of allergic inflammation. The results with CY are relevant to the treatment of asthma patients with CY and other cytotoxic agents. The findings in the GM-CSF KO mice suggest that GM-CSF is a potential therapeutic target in asthma, and that in assessment of new therapeutic agents for asthma, effects on GM-CSF should be considered.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">eosinophil</field><field name="subject">IgE</field><field name="subject">cyclophosphamide</field><field name="subject">IL-4</field><field name="subject">IL-5</field><field name="subject">IL-10</field><field name="subject">TGF-beta</field><field name="subject">regulatory T cell</field><field name="subject">GM-CSF</field><field name="subject">chemokine</field><field name="subject">CCR3</field><field name="subject">eotaxin</field><field name="subject">RANTES</field><field name="subject">IP-10</field><field name="subject">Mig</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26978</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of allergic asthma by fatty acid-binding proteins</field><field name="creator">Shum, Bennett Oh Vic, St. Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Fatty acid-binding proteins are small intracellular proteins with poorly defined functions in intracellular fatty acid transport. The adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein aP2 regulates systemic glucose and lipid metabolism. Using Affymetrix microarrays, we found that aP2, in addition to being abundantly expressed by adipocytes, is also expressed by airway epithelial cells. aP2 expression was markedly increased following stimulation of epithelial cells with the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, and downregulated by the Th1 cytokine IFN-gamma. Regulation of aP2 mRNA expression by Th2 cytokines was dependent on STAT6, a transcription factor with a major regulatory role in allergic inflammation. We examined aP2 deficient mice in a model of allergic airway inflammation, and found that infiltration of leukocytes, especially eosinophils, into the airways was highly aP2 dependent. T cell priming and peritoneal allergy was unaffected by aP2 deficiency suggesting that aP2 was acting locally within the lung, and analysis of bone marrow chimeras implicated non-haematopoietic cells, most likely airway epithelial cells, as the site of aP2 action in allergic airway inflammation. Expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines MCP-1 and IL-6 was impaired in cytokine activated aP2 deficient airway epithelial cells, while levels of the anti-inflammatory arachidonic acid metabolite 15-HETE was increased, providing a mechanism for the reduced airway inflammation in aP2 deficient mice. In addition to the immune functions of aP2, we found that the related fatty acid-binding protein mal1 was also upregulated by IL-4/IL-13 in airway epithelial cells, and mal1 deficient mice were protected against airway eosinophilia. Significantly, in comparison to single aP2 deficiency, mice with combined aP2-mal1 deficiency had augmented protection against airway inflammation, and bone marrow chimera experiments demonstrated that aP2-mal1 deficiency affected both non-haematopoeitic and haematopoeitic cells. In T cell priming experiments, aP2-mal1 deficiency resulted in defective cytokine profiles in antigen recall responses, suggesting compromised sensitisation to antigen as one mechanism for aP2-mal1 action in airway inflammation. Together, our data therefore demonstrates the crucial roles of fatty acid-binding proteins in airway epithelium, T cell priming and airway inflammation, and provides a new link between fatty acid signalling and allergy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">asthma</field><field name="subject">inflammation</field><field name="subject">Th2</field><field name="subject">cytokine</field><field name="subject">airway</field><field name="subject">airway epithelium</field><field name="subject">fatty acid</field><field name="subject">diet</field><field name="subject">allergy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic networks: communication, cooperation &amp; complexity</field><field name="creator">Angus, Simon Douglas, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the analysis of economic network formation. There are three novel sections to this thesis (Chapters 5, 6 and 8). In the first, the non-cooperative communication network formation model of Bala and Goyal (2000) (BG) is re-assessed under conditions of no inertia. It is found that the Strict Nash circle (or wheel) structure is still the equilibrium outcome for n = 3 under no inertia. However, a counter-example for n = 4 shows that with no inertia infinite cycles are possible, and hence the system does not converge. In fact, cycles are found to quickly dominate outcomes for n &gt; 4 and further numerical simulations of conditions approximating no inertia (probability of updating &gt; 0.8 to 1) indicate that cycles account for a dramatic slowing of convergence times.  These results, together with the experimental evidence of Falk and Kosfeld (2003) (FK) motivate the second contribution of this thesis.  A novel artificial agent model is constructed that allows for a vast strategy space (including the Best Response) and permits agents to learn from each other as was indicated by the FK results.  After calibration, this model replicates many of the FK experimental results and finds that an externality exploiting ratio of benefits and costs (rather than the difference) combined with a simple altruism score is a good proxy for the human objective function. Furthermore, the inequity aversion results of FK are found to arise as an emergent property of the system.  The third novel section of this thesis turns to the nature of network formation in a trust-based context. A modified Iterated Prisoners' Dilemma (IPD) model is developed which enables agents to play an additional and costly network forming action. Initially, canonical analytical results are obtained despite this modification under uniform (non-local) interactions.  However, as agent network decisions are 'turned on' persistent cooperation is observed. Furthermore, in contrast to the vast majority of non-local, or static network models in the literature, it is found that a-periodic, complex dynamics result for the system in the long-run.  Subsequent analysis of this regime indicates that the network dynamics have fingerprints of self-organized criticality (SOC). Whilst evidence for SOC is found in many physical systems, such dynamics have been seldom, if ever, reported in the strategic interaction literature.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">networks</field><field name="subject">complexity</field><field name="subject">cooperation</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">prisoners dilemma</field><field name="subject">game theory</field><field name="subject">graph-theory</field><field name="subject">agent-based modeling</field><field name="subject">finite state automata</field><field name="subject">artificial adaptive agents</field><field name="subject">computational economics</field><field name="subject">econophysics</field><field name="subject">self-organized criticality</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hierarchical fingerprint verification</field><field name="creator">Yager, Neil Gordon, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Fingerprints have been an invaluable tool for law enforcement  and forensics for over a century, motivating research into automated fingerprint based identification in the early 1960's. More recently, fingerprints have found an application in the emerging industry of biometric systems. Biometrics is the automatic identification of an individual based on physiological or behavioral characteristics.  Due to its security related applications and the current world political climate, biometrics is presently the subject of intense research by private and academic institutions. Fingerprints are emerging as the most common and trusted biometric for personal identification.  However, despite decades of intense research there are still significant challenges for the developers of automated fingerprint verification systems.  This thesis includes an examination of all major stages of the fingerprint verification process, with contributions made at each step.  The primary focus is upon fingerprint registration, which is the challenging problem of aligning two prints in order to compare their corresponding features for verification. A hierarchical approach is proposed consisting of three stages, each of which employs novel features and techniques for alignment. Experimental results show that the hierarchical approach is robust and outperforms competing state-of-the-art registration methods from the literature.  However, despite its power, like most algorithms it has limitations.  Therefore, a novel method of information fusion at the registration level has been developed.  The technique dynamically selects registration parameters from a set of competing algorithms using a statistical framework.  This allows for the relative advantages of different approaches to be exploited. The results show a significant  improvement in alignment accuracy for a wide variety of fingerprint databases.  Given a robust alignment of two fingerprints, it still remains to be verified whether or not they have originated from the same finger.  This is a non-trivial problem, and a close examination of fingerprint features available for this task is conducted with extensive experimental results.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biometrics</field><field name="subject">Fingerprint Verification</field><field name="subject">Pattern recognition</field><field name="subject">Image processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organ donation and anti-littering campaigns: a comparative study of Australia and Singapore</field><field name="creator">Lee, Bee Eng Adeline, Media, Film &amp; Theatre, UNSW</field><field name="description">Current literature on public communication campaigns suggests that challenges and problems remain, even though generally the effectiveness of campaigns has increased in the past years. Challenges and problems are issue-specific and efforts put into influencing particular social behaviours through public communication campaigns have not been significantly successful. Although public communication campaigns are a popular method employed to influence social behaviours in many societies, campaign strategies inadequately consider the impact of cultural elements on social behaviours. The disappointing results through the use of campaigns are exacerbated by the difficulties faced in translating research observations to appropriate campaign strategies.  In view of current challenges, this research examines public communication campaigns. Two main variables shaped this research ??? ???identity??? and ???culture???. The research postulated that a person???s identity influences his or her behaviour. It also argued that culture would impact on behaviour. The theoretical orientation drew on interpretivist perspectives. Using a comparative cross-cultural method, this research nominated the issues of organ donation and waste disposal behaviours in public places and the countries of Australia and Singapore for empirical study. Focus group research was employed. A total of sixteen focus groups were conducted ??? eight groups on organ donation (four in Sydney, Australia and four in Singapore) and eight groups on waste disposal behaviours (four in Sydney, Australia and four in Singapore). In line with the theoretical orientation, ???grounded theory??? was used to analyse the focus group transcripts.  It is argued that a person???s decision to organ donation or waste disposal behaviour was intimately related to his or her identity. Cultural elements are critical constituents of identity. This is to say, cultural values, beliefs and attitudes have significant impact on social behaviours. These intricacies were made apparent when each issue was seen in the national contexts of Australia and Singapore. This research concludes that issues of identity can partly explain the type of decision a person makes about organ donation, and the kind of waste disposal behaviour a person enacts. It also argues that the effectiveness of campaign strategies can potentially be enhanced, if the strategies are responsive to people???s identities.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public communication campaign</field><field name="subject">organ donation</field><field name="subject">littering</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consenting adults in private: in search of the sexual subject</field><field name="creator">Gleeson, Kate, School of Politics &amp; International Relations, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis I examine the ways in which the modern state addresses sex. I want to ascertain by what considerations the state is informed in its relationship to sex. What is behind the state???s regulation of sexual practices? What is its interest in regard to sex? To answer these questions I examine fundamental artefacts of the modern state, especially the law (but also the bureaucracy), as directed by the 1993 English court case of Brown. Brown involves the search for the sexual subject; The Lords in Brown were at a loss for how to conceptualise the subject before them. Their search is my own: who is the sexual subject? What is his relationship to the state?  To answer these questions, Brown directs me for authority to two widely separated moments of supposed classic ???discontinuity???: the 1957 Wolfenden Report, and the late-Victorian Queen???s Bench. These two moments in government - the 1960s and the 1880s - are usually depicted as ideologically different, indicating discontinuity, difference, change and perhaps even revolution between the relative approaches of the state to sex. And yet, in Brown, both are upheld as appropriate contemporary authorities on sex, the individual and the state. Here I take my cue from the Lords and interrogate the artefacts of these two periods in government to ascertain the story of the 20th century state???s relationship to sex. My thesis is a political analysis that incorporates genealogy in its focus on law as indicative of the state. It incorporates a detailed study of primary artefacts of the state: detailed analyses of seemingly discontinuous moments including individual court cases, individual Committees, individual treatises and opinions and political memoirs. I conclude by drawing together my overall argument, that during the 20th century there has been no radical change of the modern state in regard to sex, and that the success of the permissive mythology has generally blinded us to this fact. Not only have we mistaken the nature of the permissive state as concerned with evolution, we have erroneously been persuaded of the blanket repression of the Victorian state. The big break, the discontinuity of the 1960s, that often is described as ???revolutionary??? (and inevitable in the teleology of progress), is a re-configuration of the same object as the Victorian state. The permissive state enacts the latest stage in the great Victorian project of embodying the sexual subject ??? a subject at once embodied and created as an object of control.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27214</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vivo bone formation using Adipose Derived Stromal Stem Cells. The histomorphometry of the ovine defect model</field><field name="creator">Niechoda, Beata, School of Surgery, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of stem cells to augment the healing of bone defects represents an exciting new frontier in many surgical disciplines. This thesis verified the in vitro osteogenic capability of ovine Adipose Derived Stromal Stem Cells (ADSCs) and Bone Marrow Derived Stem Cells (BMSCs), examined the in vivo osteogenic potential of the ovine ADSCs population and compared it to the in vivo osteogenic potential of ovine BMSCs. The pilot study used both cell populations, expanded and osteogenically stimulated ex vivo and mixed with resorbable porous hydroxyapatite-calcium carbonate bone graft substitute (ProOsteon 200R, Interpore Cross International, Irvine, CA). This study demonstrated the preferred length of time in ex vivo osteogenic stimulation of the ADSCs and BMSCs populations to promote the bone formation in vivo to be 7 days. In the main ovine study which employed 48 wethers, ADSCs and BMSCs were expanded, stimulated osteogenically for 7 days, mixed with ProOsteon 200R and deposited in an autologous manner into a bilateral medial femoral condyle confined cancellous defect. In vivo performance of 7 treatment groups was examined: 1. ???Bone autograft/ADSCs???, 2. ???Bone autograft/BMSCs???, 3. ???ProOsteon 200R/ADSCs???, 4. ???ProOsteon 200R/BMSCs???, 5. ???Bone autograft???, 6. ???ProOsteon 200R??? and 7. ???Empty defect???. The time-points were: 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. The analysis of the harvested specimens used the following methods: computerized tomography, histological assessment, histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry. There was a progressive and time dependant increase in woven bone in the defects treated with ADSCs and BMSCs across all time points. The amount of woven bone in the defects treated with the combination of ADSCs and ProOsteon 200R was comparable with the defects treated with the combination of BMSCs and ProOsteon 200R. In addition, the combination of ADSCs or BMSCs and ProOsteon 200R demonstrated no more bone than ProOsteon 200R alone. However, the ???Autograft/BMSCs??? and ???Autograft/ADSCs??? groups demonstrated a remarkable increase in the amount of woven bone formed in the defects across all time points when compared with all other groups. In addition, the amounts of bone formed in the ???Autograft/BMSCs??? and the ???Autograft/ADSCs??? group were comparable across all timepoints. The results of these studies support the hypothesis that ovine ADSCs and BMSCs populations in combination with the bone autograft can increase the formation of woven bone in the autologous orthotopic environment in a comparable manner.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Correlates of protective immunity in individuals who are exposed to Hepatitis C but appear uninfected</field><field name="creator">Elliott, Lisa, Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The hepatitis C virus (HCV) currently infects 3% of the world???s population, with chronic infection in 50-80% of exposed individuals. A small subset of individuals who are exposed to HCV do not develop anti-HCV antibodies, persistent viraemia or chronic hepatitis despite generating HCV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These individuals are believed to develop an immune response which rapidly clears viraemia prior to the induction of an antibody response. Circumstantial evidence supports the likelihood that some of these individuals may generate these same responses and outcomes on repeated occasions of HCV infection. HCV-specific cellular immune responses in seronegative subjects have been the subject of only limited prior study, in part due to the lack of appropriate recombinant antigens and assay systems. Therefore, this thesis described the development and validation of an interferon-? (IFN-?) ELISPOT assay using overlapping peptides (n=441). Using this assay, HCV-specific cellular immune responses were detected in 5/10 (50%) of chronically infected subjects. Responses were identified more frequently, and were directed against more regions of the HCV genome, than with traditional assay systems. This IFN-? ELISPOT assay, a comparable interleukin (IL)-2 ELISPOT assay, and a multiplex in vitro cytokine production assay were then used to evaluate HCV-specific cellular immune responses in three cohorts of seronegative subjects at high-risk of exposure to HCV ??? babies born to infected mothers, multiply-transfused subjects with thalassaemia, and high risk injecting drug users. Cellular immune responses were evaluated in 23 infants born to HCV-antibody positive women. Responses were not detected in infants born to HCV-PCR negative mothers. IFN-? production was detected in 1/11 infants born to viraemic mothers using the ELISPOT assay, with cytokine production observed in an additional 3/5 infants studied using the in vitro cytokine production assay. HCV-specific cellular immune responses were assessed in a cohort of multiply transfused subjects with thalassaemia using assays for cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity, IFN-? and IL-2 ELISPOT, as well as lymphocyte proliferation and in vitro cytokine production. Responses were detected in 6/13 chronically infected subjects (46%), 4/7 subjects who had cleared infection (71%), and 14/17 seronegative subjects (82%). The seronegative subjects had responses which were broader and higher in magnitude than those with chronic HCV infection, although lower and narrower than in subjects who had cleared prior HCV infection. IFN-? and IL-2 ELISPOT assays, in additional to in vitro cytokine production assays, were performed on 41 injecting drug users (IDUs), with responses detected in 6 (15%). Seronegative IDUs with HCV-specific cellular immune responses had been injecting for a mean of 7.7 years, and reported multiple risk factors for exposure to HCV. The combined data from these three cohorts indicate that the HCV-specific cellular immune responses detected in seronegative subjects were generally broad in specificity. Cytokine production was generally Th1-biased, a pattern which has previously been associated with an increased likelihood of clearance in primary infection. The findings also suggest that responses can be maintained for decades after exposure, and may provide protection against repeated exposures. In summary, cellular immunity against HCV is evident in some seronegative high risk subjects, suggesting that the cellular immune responses may efficiently facilitate viral clearance. Understanding the mechanisms of this immune response pattern will allow better understanding of the host response to HCV and may provide key insights into vaccine design.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hepatitis C</field><field name="subject">Protective Immunity</field><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring and interpreting human movement patterns using a triaxial accelerometer</field><field name="creator">Mathie, Merryn Joy, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the hypothesis that a single, waist-mounted triaxial accelerometer (TA) can be used to monitor human movement patterns in unsupervised, freeliving subjects over extended periods, and that it can be used to quantitatively measure parameters that can provide clinical insight into the health status of the subject. A rigorous theoretical and experimental understanding of the signals obtained from a TA is developed. The effect of the placement of the TA device on the waist is explored and a model relating device position to TA signal is developed for a range of postures and activities. A classification framework for movement identification using the signals from a waist-mounted TA is presented. This framework is based on a hierarchical binary processing tree and is designed for real time use. An implementation of this framework for monitoring housebound patients is presented. Algorithms for detecting falls, distinguishing between activity and rest, classifiying transitions between different postural orientations, and for identifying periods of standing, sitting, lying and walking are developed. In evaluation studies performed in controlled laboratory conditions, every algorithm performed with better than 90% accuracy. Once movements are identified, movement-specific parameters sensitive to changes in functional status are extracted from the signal. A two stage methodology for employing the accelerometry system in monitoring free-living subjects is introduced. The first stage involved monitoring specific movements through a directed routine. The second stage involved monitoring of free movement. Signals obtained from the directed routine are used to extract clinically relevant, movement-specific parameters. Signals obtained from the period of free movement are monitored for falls and other abnormal events. General parameters of movement, including energy expenditure, are also measured. The system was evaluated in a series of field studies in laboratory and home environments, in supervised and unsupervised settings, using cohorts of healthy subjects. A pilot trial was conducted in which six healthy elderly subjects wore the TA device for a period of up to three months. The technical performance and useability of the system were evaluated. Clinically significant parameters were measured and the effects of age and health status on the measured parameters were evaluated.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">accelerometry</field><field name="subject">triaxial accelerometer</field><field name="subject">human movement</field><field name="subject">patient monitoring</field><field name="subject">home telecare</field><field name="subject">tele-homecare</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing the cooperative binding properties of 1,1'-bis(1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines)</field><field name="creator">Jones, Michael William, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The design of partially reduced 1,1'-bisisoquinoline derivatives was investigated with the aim of controlling the conformation about the C1-C1' axis. This would produce ligands with unusual but predictable ligand binding properties, particularly cooperativity. The introduction of ??-aminoalkyl, ??-azidoalkyl, ??-alkynyl and ??-alkenyl groups onto the nitrogens of the reduced bisisoquinoline core was conducted with the intention of broadening the scope of the ligand. Subsequent epoxidation, hydroboration and Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of terminal unsaturated groups and nucleophilic displacement of the chlorine of the corresponding known bischloroacetyl derivative afforded representative examples of new ligand types for future study. 1,1'-Bis(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6,7-dimethoxyisoquinoline) was found to readily condense with a wide range of aldehydes to give imidazolines and aspects of the rates of condensation were determined. Mono-alkyl bisisoquinolines were obtained efficiently by cleavage of the imidazolines through a newly defined treatment with sodium cyanoborohydride under acidic conditions. A procedure was developed whereby these two steps could be accomplished in a sequential one-pot process. The mono-alkyl compounds were further derivatized through acetylation, alkylation, sulfonylation and reductive alkylation. Synthetic strategies towards ??-excessive N-arenealkyl derivatives were established with the goal to create scaffolds for the coordination of ??-deficient systems, of which the X-ray crystal structures of three N-arenemethyl derivatives were elucidated. These are each closely related in conformation about the C1-C1' axis. Reaction of two examples of the N-arenealkyl compounds with copper(II) and palladium(II) chlorides, furnished the first known examples of this type of highly reduced 1,1'-bisisoquinoline-metal complex. Single crystal X-ray crystallography was used to analyse the structures of these complexes in the solid state. Preliminary physicochemical investigations were conducted with a view to determining the conformation of the molecules about the bisisoquinoline C1-C1' bond. The interaction of intermolecular N-aryl ??-excessive compounds with ??-deficient systems was found to result in minimal spectroscopic changes. Complementary intramolecular ??-excessive/??-deficient systems were found through fluorometric analysis to readily form charge transfer complexes. Finally, it was determined that the conformation of 1,1'-bis[2-(methoxy-18- crown-6)ethanoyl-6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline] could be controlled by the simultaneous coordination of the termini of the diperchlorate salt of 1,3-diaminopropane to the crown ether moieties of the ligand. A range of new N-substituted bisisoquinolines have been synthesised and methods developed for determining interactions between parts of these molecules that through these physicochemical characteristics could allow monitoring of conformational behaviour in future studies.

Edd null mice and hyd mutants display embryonic lethality. EDD is also a multifunctional HECT family E3 ubiquitin protein-ligase, with reported roles in both progesterone action and the DNA damage response. To investigate the possible involvement of EDD in human cancer, several cancer types were analysed for allelic gain or loss (allelic imbalance, AI) at the EDD locus. AI of the EDD locus was most frequent in the serous subtype of ovarian cancer (16/22, 73%) and common in other cancers, including breast cancer (31%). AI is likely to represent amplification of the EDD gene locus rather than loss of heterozygosity, as quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry showed that EDD mRNA and protein are frequently overexpressed in breast and ovarian cancers. These data imply a potential role for EDD in cancer progression.  However, depletion of EDD from cells in culture by RNA interference had very little effect on proliferation and cell survival. To identify EDD-regulated pathways, transcript analysis was performed on EDD-depleted cells. The results suggested that EDD modulates cell-cell communication and the actin cytoskeleton. Consistent with transcript analysis, depletion of EDD from two normal breast cell lines (HMEC-184 and MCF-10A) resulted in altered cell morphology, with decreased cell-cell contacts. This was concurrent with altered beta-catenin (an integral component of adherens junctions) at cell-cell contacts, which was also observed in the developing blood vessels of Edd null mice. Interestingly, total cellular beta-catenin levels were not affected. Furthermore, EDD depletion resulted in a decrease in expression of the cytoskeletal regulators twinfilin and R-RAS, with a simultaneous decrease in MAPK (ERK1 and ERK2) activity. Consistent with disruption of adherens junctions, EDD-depleted mammary acini lost tissue coordination and polarity.  These data provide a significant advance in our knowledge of EDD, both in its role in regulating the organisation of cells into higher structures and its potential role in the development of cancer. This has relevance to an understanding of embryonic development and the role of tissue homeostasis in cancer progression.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Genetic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Cancer cells.</field><field name="subject">Gene expression.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin signal transduction in vivo in states of lipid-induced insulin resistance</field><field name="creator">Frangioudakis, Georgia, St Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Insulin resistance is the major metabolic defect in obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Increased lipid accumulation is strongly associated with insulin resistance. A significant component of insulin resistance is thought to be a reduced ability of insulin to activate the cascade of phosphorylation events that lead to the metabolic effects of this hormone. The broad aims of this thesis were to examine the effect of high-fat diets containing different fat subtypes on in vivo insulin signalling, under conditions normally used to detect whole body insulin resistance, and to compare the effects of acute and chronic lipid oversupply on insulin signalling in vivo. Time-course and dose-response effects of insulin stimulation on site-specific phosphorylation of key signalling proteins were studied in rat tissues in vivo, to establish an appropriate experimental system to examine the onset of activation of the insulin signalling pathway. It was determined that short insulin infusions with concurrent glucose infusion, similar to the beginning of a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp, significantly increased the phosphorylation of major intermediates of the insulin signalling pathway in important tissues of insulin action (skeletal muscle [RQ], liver [LIV] and white adipose tissue [EPI]). These experiments provided a platform to study insulin signalling under the same conditions used to study lipid-induced insulin resistance. The provision of diets enriched in polyunsaturated or saturated fatty acids (FA) resulted in the corresponding enrichment of these fat subtypes in rat plasma and tissues. However, the effects on insulin signalling were essentially the same. Both fat diets induced defects in sitespecific phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and protein kinase B (PKB) in RQ and LIV, but not EPI. This suggests that the amount of fat in the diet, rather than enrichment in a particular fat subtype, had a greater impact on the development of signalling defects and that the response to high-fat feeding was tissue-specific. A 3hr elevation of circulating FA (using a lipid/heparin infusion), to a level that is relevant in clinical Type 2 diabetes, impaired insulin-stimulated PKB phosphorylation with no significant effect on IRS-1 phosphorylation. This suggests that there may be differences in the way acute and chronic exposure to increased FA impair insulin signalling. The phosphorylation defects observed in both chronic and acute studies did not seem to be associated with activation of major stress signalling pathways (JNK and NFkB), which have been suggested to have a role in lipidinduced insulin resistance. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that impaired IRS-1 and PKB phosphorylation do have a role in the reduced insulin action observed with lipid oversupply in vivo, because the changes were detected under similar conditions as those used to determine whole body insulin resistance.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Insulin resistance</field><field name="subject">non-insulin-dependent diabetes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27419</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distributed discovery and management of alternate internet paths with enhanced quality of service</field><field name="creator">Rakotoarivelo, Thierry, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The convergence of recent technology advances opens the way to new ubiquitous environments, where network-enabled devices collectively form invisible pervasive computing and networking environments around the users. These users increasingly require extensive applications and capabilities from these devices. Recent approaches propose that cooperating service providers, at the edge of the network, offer these required capabilities (i.e services), instead of having them directly provided by the devices. Thus, the network evolves from a plain communication medium into an endless source of services. Such a service, namely an overlay application, is composed of multiple distributed application elements, which cooperate via a dynamic communication mesh, namely an overlay association. The Quality of Service (QoS) perceived by the users of an overlay application greatly depends on the QoS on the communication paths of the corresponding overlay association. This thesis asserts and shows that it is possible to provide QoS to an overlay application by using alternate Internet paths resulting from the compositions of independent consecutive paths. Moreover, this thesis also demonstrates that it is possible to discover, select and compose these independent paths in a distributed manner within an community comprising a limited large number of autonomous cooperating peers, such as the fore-mentioned service providers. Thus, the main contributions of this thesis are i) a comprehensive description and QoS characteristic analysis of these composite alternate paths, and ii) an original architecture, termed SPAD (Super-Peer based Alternate path Discovery), which allows the discovery and selection of these alternate paths in a distributed manner.

The effort, known as Network Mobility (NEMO), paves the way to support high-speed Internet access in mass transit systems, e.g. trains; buses; ferries; and planes; through the use of on-board mobile routers embedded in the vehicle. One of the critical research challenges of this vision is to achieve high-speed and reliable back-haul connectivity between the mobile router and the rest of the Internet. The problem is particularly challenging due to the fact that a mobile router must rely on wireless links with limited bandwidth and unpredictable quality variations as the vehicle moves around. In this thesis, the multi-homing concept is applied to approach the problem. With multi-homing, mobile router has more than one connection to the Internet. This is achieved by connecting the mobile router to a diverse array of wireless access technologies (e.g., GPRS, CDMA, 802.11, and 802.16) and/or a multiplicity of wireless service providers. While the aggregation helps addressing the bandwidth problem, quality variation problem can be mitigated by employing advanced traffic engineering techniques that dynamically control inbound and outbound traffic over multiple connections. More specifically, the thesis investigates traffic engineering solutions for mobile networks that can effectively address the performance objectives, e.g. maximizing profit for mobile network operator; guaranteeing quality of service for the users; and maintaining fair access to the back-haul bandwidth. Traffic engineering solutions with three different levels of control have been investigated. First, it is shown, using detailed computer simulation of popular applications and networking protocols(e.g., File Transfer Protocol and Transmission Control Protocol), that packet-level traffic engineering which makes decisions of which Internet connection to use for each and every packet, leads to poor system throughput. The main problem with packet-based traffic engineering stems from the fact that in mobile environment where link bandwidths and delay can vary significantly, packets using different connections may experience different delays causing unexpected arrivals at destinations. Second, a maximum utility flow-level traffic engineering has been proposed that aims to maximize a utility function that accounts for bandwidth utilization on the one hand, and fairness on the other. The proposed solution is compared against previously proposed flow-level traffic engineering schemes and shown to have better performance in terms of throughput and fairness. The third traffic engineering proposal addresses the issue of maximizing operator?s profit when different Internet connections have different charging rates, and guaranteeing per user bandwidth through admission control. Finally, a new signaling protocol is designed to allow the mobile router to control its inbound traffic.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Traffic engineering -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">TCP/IP (Computer network protocol)</field><field name="subject">Wireless Internet.</field><field name="subject">Mobile computing.</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Internetworking (Telecommunication)</field><field name="subject">Routers (Computer networks)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40760</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practices of proximity: appropriation in the Australian contact zone.</field><field name="creator">Russo, Katherine, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the last thirty years appropriation has been studied as the practice of reworking earlier works of art or literature by presenting them in new contexts, or to challenge notions of individual creativity or authenticity in art. However, the term "appropriation" is hotly debated in the fields of Indigenous and Post-colonial studies for technologies such as the English language, writing and visual art have for a long time assumed the connotation of 'colonial property'. The object of this enquiry is to explore the extent to which Indigenous Australian appropriations of the English language, writing and visual art, provide -- though they differ widely in terms of themes, strategies and styles -- a terrain for discussing unexplored issues of intercultural representation, epistemology and interpretation. The dissertation offers a close reading of literary and visual "practices of proximity", such as interlanguages, editorial relations and cross-cultural exhibitions, in order to demonstrate that Indigenous Australian appropriations variously disrupt neo/colonial claims of property.  This dissertation is organized thematically, and consists of three parts entitled "Interlanguages", "Intertextual Performances" and "Contested  Sights". Each part consists of three chapters, which move from an initial questioning of technology as colonial property, to the close analysis of some Indigenous appropriations and non-Indigenous counterappropriations. Situated at the crossroads between Indigenous and Postcolonial studies, the dissertation offers insights into the timely debates on sovereignty, difference and subject positioning. The combination of theories of "appropriation" and "intersubjectivity" illuminates a new path in theorizing Australian intercultural relations. The Australian contact zone is unveiled as a place of Indigenous sovereignty where the colonial subject is ontologically and epistemologically constituted in correlation with Indigenous peoples. Thereby, the Indigenous/non-Indigenous intersubjective relation is recognised as the ground from which notions of the colonial self and other derive and which colonial reifying selfreflection has misconceived as separate.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication.</field><field name="subject">Communication and culture.</field><field name="subject">Cross-cultural studies -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Communication -- Evaluation.</field><field name="subject">Art -- Cross-cultural studies -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the constitutional and legal frameworks for the regulation of racial vilification in Australia</field><field name="creator">Meagher, Daniel, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis involves an analysis of the constitutional and legal frameworks for the regulation of racial vilification in Australia. In doing so, it has two aims. First, I wish to discern the constitutional parameters for Australian laws where political communication forms part of the conduct sought to be regulated. The High Court has recognised that the Australian Constitution contains an implied right to freedom of political communication (???implied freedom???). It operates to invalidate legislative and executive action which impairs the effective operation of our system of constitutional government. The scope of the implied freedom remains unclear, however. There is no consensus on the High Court as to what constitutes ???political communication??? or when a law can be said to impair constitutional government. I will seek to answer these open constitutional questions and in doing so outline a methodology to determine whether racial vilification may count as political communication. If so, I will then consider whether this, consequently, imperils the validity of existing Australian racial vilification laws. And second, I want to critically evaluate the normative legitimacy of Australian racial vilification laws and propose legislative reform in the event that my analysis reveals any serious flaws in the current legal framework. The methodology outlined in the first part of the thesis provides the relevant constitutional parameters within which any proposed legislative reform must fall. In the result, I conclude that racial vilification can amount to political communication but that most Australian racial vilification laws are, nevertheless, compatible with the implied freedom and valid as a consequence. However, my evaluation of Australian civil and criminal racial vilification laws reveals that most are seriously flawed. Consequently, a detailed reform program is outlined to remedy the major legislative deficiencies. It is my view that the law has an important but limited role to play in the regulation of racial vilification in Australia. It is certainly reasonable and prudent to have precise and well-targeted laws to proscribe and punish racial vilification but policy and law-makers should not overstate or overestimate the ability of the law to effect grass roots attitudinal and behavioural changes on matters of race.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of the Fos technique to investigate the physiology and pharmacology of trigeminovascular sensation.</field><field name="creator">Hoskin, Karen Lisa, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Migraine is a disabling condition which affects approximately 10% of the population. The burden of migraine is recognised by the W.H.O., which lists it among the top 20 causes of disability. The underlying cause is largely unknown, but what is known is that the trigeminal nerve plays a central role in relaying nociceptive information from the &amp;quot pain-sensitive&amp;quot intracranial/extracerebral blood vessels to the central nervous system (CNS). This pathway is referred to as the &amp;quot trigeminovascular system&amp;quot . In the CNS, second order neurones are located in the dorsal horn of the caudal medulla (CM) and upper cervical spinal cord (C1 and C2). A better understanding of these cells, their anatomical location, the physiological factors that activate them and the drugs that may act to inhibit them will advance our current understanding of migraine. This thesis aims to extend knowledge of second order cells in the trigeminovascular system by using the immunohistochemical detection of the nuclear proto-oncogene cfos as a marker of neurons activated by noxious stimuli. The specific aims were:- 1. To delineate the population of cells in the brainstem and spinal cord which are involved in processing trigeminovascular nociception in the cat (Felis catus) and monkey (Macaca nemestrina), following either electrical or mechanical stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus or middle meningeal artery. 2. To develop and evaluate a model that may be useful to screen drugs of potential benefit in the treatment of migraine. The following findings were made: 1. In cat and monkey, lamina I and lamina II outer (IIo) of CM, C1 and C2, and the caudal nucleus tractus solitarius (cNTS) of CM and lamina X of C1 and C2 are two anatomically- and functionally-continuous nuclei which receive sensory input from dural structures and which are activated following stimulation of these structures. 2. Fos expression in lamina I/IIo can be attenuated by pretreatment with drugs that are effective in the treatment of migraine, but not by drugs which are ineffective in the treatment of migraine. This work suggests that monitoring Fos expression in these neurones is an effective method for the preclinical evaluation of antimigraine drugs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27458</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autobiographical memory during hypnotic identity delusions.</field><field name="creator">Cox, Rochelle Evelyn, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to examine the impact of an identity delusion on autobiographical memory and develop a model of deluded autobiographical memory to guide future research in this area. Given the difficulty of studying identity delusions in isolation from other clinical disorders, this thesis presents six experiments that used hypnosis as a laboratory model of identity delusions. Chapter 1 reviews literature from three distinct areas, including delusions, autobiographical memory, and hypnosis. Chapter 1 reviews a model of the self and autobiographical memory proposed by Conway (2005) and outlines the value of using hypnosis instrumentally to model delusions of self. Chapter 2 presents two experiments that established hypnosis as a suitable paradigm for investigating identity delusions. These experiments examined the parameters of the hypnotic delusion and tested the impact of the delusion on self and autobiographical memory. Chapter 3 presents two experiments that continued to examine the characteristics of autobiographical memory during a hypnotic identity delusion. These experiments indexed the specificity, source, perspective, and qualitative features of autobiographical memories elicited during a suggested identity delusion. Chapter 4 presents two experiments that investigated memory processing during a hypnotic identity delusion. These experiments illustrated the shifting accessibility of autobiographical memories during a hypnotic identity delusion. Finally, Chapter 5 draws the empirical findings together to discuss the value of hypnosis as a technique for modelling identity delusions and the ways in which a hypnotic identity delusion influences autobiographical memory. Importantly, Chapter 5 proposes a model of deluded autobiographical memory that integrates Conway???s (2005) self-memory system with relevant aspects of Langdon and Coltheart???s (2000) two-factor theory of delusions. Using this proposed model as a framework, Chapter 5 discusses the clinical and theoretical implications of the findings from this thesis and suggests future research directions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Identity (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Delusions.</field><field name="subject">Hypnotism -- Research.</field><field name="subject">Autobiographical memory.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fatigue in automatic transmissions</field><field name="creator">Ninic, Dejan, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A novel method of predicting the multiaxial high-cycle fatigue strength of metallic components is proposed and verified for various steel, aluminium and cast iron alloys.

Hcrt has been implicated in a range of functions associated with high arousal states including feeding, wakefulness, motor activity, autonomic function and stress. This thesis investigated the role of Hcrt in two forms of psychological stress, conditioned fear to context and restraint. Three complementary techniques were used in rats. (i) Lesions of Hcrt containing neurons and surrounding cells were made with a Hcrt-saporin toxin and the cardiovascular and behavioural response to stress investigated using radiotelemetry. (ii) Fos was used as an indicator of Hcrt neuronal activity during stress in both the day and night time. (iii) Radioimmunoassay was used to determine the release of the Hcrt peptide into the CSF during stress. The lesions reduced the cardiovascular and behavioural response to contextual fear but did not affect the response to restraint. Similarly, the activity of Hcrt neurons and the release of the Hcrt peptide were greater after contextual fear than after restraint. These results suggest that Hcrt neurons are involved in specific forms of stress, which are likely to include stressors that are purely psychological (contextual fear) rather than stressors that have an additional physical component (restraint). Most importantly it was also shown that Hcrt???s involvement was not determined by the degree of stress, as increased stress did not result in more Hcrt neuronal activity or Hcrt peptide release than exploratory activity in a non-feared context. This was demonstrated during both day and night when baseline Hcrt and arousal levels were low and high, respectively. It is proposed that Hcrt contributes to the increased attention and arousal that is required to interact with the environment during some stressful and non-stressful conditions. Importantly, this idea integrates the many previously proposed but poorly linked functions of Hcrt.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrical and seismic responses of shallow, volcanogenic, massive sulphide ore deposits</field><field name="creator">Whiteley, Robert, School of Mines, UNSW</field><field name="description">SP, resistivity/IP and seismic refraction responses of the Woodlawn Orebody and Mt.Bulga Deposit are examined and compared. Both exhibit similar responses produced mainly by uneconomic and disseminated sulphide mineralization and host rock features, demonstrating that the magnitude and character of electrical and seismic responses are not reliable indicators of size and economic sulphide content of volcanogenic sulphide ores. SP, soil geochemistry and electrogeochemistry are found to be the most effective exploration methods followed by resistivity/IP and seismic refraction. The large SP responses over both ore zones are simulated using new methods which allowed the width and depth of oxidation to be computed. Conventional and compensation array resistivity responses best define the deposits. Computer simulation shows that dipole- dipole and Unipole arrays are most useful. First order IP responses are large and similar, but the ore zones are not easily distinguished from polarizable host rocks. Second order responses, at Woodlawn, better define these lithologies and cross-plots of EM coupling removed first order parameters prove useful. The supergene and gossan zones are defined as sources of electrical anomalies and correlate with interpreted SP sources. Seismic velocities of fresh Woodlawn ore samples indicate only small contrasts with host rocks. Refraction travel-time data are highly complex but host rocks are clearly distinguished by their seismic velocities. Both deposits appear as low velocity zones at the general bedrock level which are shallower and narrower than the electrical sources associated with the ore zones. Extensive model simulation shows that the Reciprocal interpretation method is most useful when compared to other time- term methods for refraction interpretation but has some limitations. Computer simulation shows the significance of non- critical refractions, diffractions and laterally hidden zones which define the lateral resolution of the refraction method.

Specific studies include i) the oxidation of Fe(II) in the absence and presence of both model and natural organic ligands,  ii) the complexation of Fe(III) by model organic  compounds, and iii) the precipitation of Fe(III) through the use of both laboratory investigations of iron species and kinetic modeling.  In the absence of organic ligands, oxidation of nanomolar concentrations of Fe(II) over the pH range 6.0 -- 8.0 is predominantly controlled by the reaction of Fe(II) with oxygen and with superoxide while the disproportionation of superoxide appears to be negligible. Oxidation of Fe(II) by hydrogen peroxide, back reduction of Fe(III) by superoxide and precipitation of Fe(III) have been shown to exert some influences at various stages of the oxidation at different pH and initial Fe(II) concentrations. In the presence of organic ligands, different effects on the Fe(II) oxidation kinetics is shown with different organic ligands, their initial concentrations and with varying pH. A detailed kinetic model is developed and shown to adequately describe the kinetics of Fe(II) oxidation in the absence and presence of various ligands over a range of concentrations and pH. The applicability of the previous oxidation models to describe the experimental data is assessed.  Rate constants for formation of Fe(III) by a range of model organic compounds over the pH range 6.0 -- 9.5 are determined. Variation of rate constants for Fe(III) complexation by desferrioxamine B and ethylenediaminetetraacetate with varying pH is explained by an outer-sphere complexation model. The significant variation in rate constants of Fe(III) complexation by salicylate,  5-sulfosalicylate, citrate and 3,4-dihydroxylbenzoate with varying pH is possibly due to the presence of different complexes at different pH. The results of this study demonstrate that organic ligands from different sources may influence the speciation of iron in vastly different ways.  The kinetics of Fe(III) precipitation are investigated in bicarbonate solutions over the pH range 6.0 -- 9.5. The rate of precipitation varies by nearly two orders of magnitude with a maximum rate constant at a pH of around 8.0. The results of the study support the existence of the dissolved neutral species Fe(OH)30 and suggests that it is the dominant precursor in Fe(III) polymerization and subsequent precipitation at circumneutral pH. Variation in the precipitation rate constant over the pH range considered is consistent with a mechanism in which the kinetics of iron precipitation are controlled by rates of water exchange in dissolved iron hydrolysis species.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Iron oxides.</field><field name="subject">Water -- Purification -- Iron removal.</field><field name="subject">Fresh water.</field><field name="subject">Water quality.</field><field name="subject">Iron bacteria.</field><field name="subject">Water chemistry.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40649</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The persuasion-knowledge gap</field><field name="creator">Forshaw, Michael, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Historically, dialectics is the general method of (early) philosophy. The philosophy rhetoric controversy of modern dialectics (or argumentation theory) is reducible to a persuasion-knowledge gap. It's addressed in five parts. First, disputes in discourse (dialectics). Critical discussion or debate involves disagreement and contention. An agent's position on an issue includes an opinion (or claim) and ground. A ground is strategically developed in a contest of strengths using psycho-social influence and persuasion. This depends on the conveyance of meaning. Dispute resolution occurs where there is preponderance and a dominant position. The remaining parts selectively elaborate this framework. Second, persuasion (rhetoric). Persuasion involves the use of appeals e.g. rhetorical devices, arguments etc. to influence the propositional attitudes of agents. A hormic-hedonic infrastructure of mind suggests that psycho-social influence occurs through interest-satisfaction and results in an attitude (acceptance-withholding or rejection) toward a proposition. An agents internally operate according to an opinion-persuasion relation with thresholds, which most likely belong to the class of sigmoid functions. Benchmarks (thresholds) are set by a standard of establishment or proof. Satisfying a good standard is a preferred condition for action. Third, reason (dianoetics). Reason is impassioned rationally-principled semi -- autonomous intellect. The hormic-hedonic infrastructure of mind suggests it's  a source (ideas) and an influence (pro-rational passions). Rationality rests on concepts and principles that regulate conduct (thought, feeling and action). Rational discourse isn't fully understood game-theoretically. A  jurisprudential metaphor offers proof-based decision-making as an  approach. Fourth, conduct (strategics). The aim of dispute involves both persuasion and dominance in a contest of strength. Arguments are an important class of appeals; they have cogency as their strength attribute. Strategically, conduct involves argumentative strategic criticism. A universal argumentation scheme describes conduct generally and is the basis for strength aggregates. Ideally, dispute resolution occurs when one position satisfies the standard of establishment or proof. Game-theoretically, establishment- or proof-based decision-making involves scores, voting and Arrow's theorem. Fifth, the dialectics of alethic inquiry (epistemics). This is the application of dialectics to claims. Internally, they are beliefs or knowledge. Difficulties (e.g. the Gettier challenge) with the standard justified true belief (JTB) model leads to alternatives like cognitivism, gradualism and thresholdism. What is proposed is an open contested certified true belief model that makes use of a claim-persuasion relation with thresholds. It is underwritten by a progressive rational regimentation of influences that is naturally based on a common ground of pragmatic reliabilism. This requires a preference for persuasive over non-persuasive influences. Thus, knowledge  is belief with proof where proof-based decision-making rests on the cogency of arguments and case. Finally, by bridging the persuasion-knowledge gap, the philosophy-rhetoric controversy is settled and a reconciliation of philosophy (representing dialectics) and rhetoric is achieved. Rhetoric is a sub-discipline of dialectics. An implication is a denial of the incommensurability of theories associated with critical discussion and debate in discourse.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Persuasion (Rhetoric)</field><field name="subject">Philosophy.</field><field name="subject">Rhetoric.</field><field name="subject">Dialectic.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prediction of bearing failure in pin-loaded laminates</field><field name="creator">Ujjin, Rapee, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of an investigation of bearing failure at a loaded hole in carbon fibre composite laminates. The investigation included finite element analysis and a program of experimental testing for quasi-isotropic laminates, uni-directional laminates and laminates with fibres steered along predefined trajectories. The investigation formed part of a research program in the Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Composite Structures Ltd (CRC-ACS) support by the Office of Naval Research from the United States. Work in progress in the CRC includes research defined in this thesis including the addition of nano-particles to the resin to improve the bearing strength. The literature survey undertaken in this thesis identified that the micro-buckling theory proposed by Professor C.T. Sun from Purdue University, Indiana USA, is the best analysis procedure for initial bearing failure in pin-loaded laminates. This failure theory has therefore been implemented in a Fortran program using the results from a finite element analysis for the nonlinear contact problem of a pin bearing on a hole in a composite laminate. The finite element analysis is executed using the commercial finite element system MSC.MARC. The numerical predictions have been validated by a test of progressive failure with the aid of an acoustic emission monitoring system. The acoustic emission parametric and frequency analysis is performed using the acoustic emission software Vallen Systeme. Fast fourier transformation of the waveform have been achieved to distinguish and identify microfailure mode. Failure mechanisms have been verified by post-mortem microstructural examination. There are 3 failure mechanisms associated with bearing failure in carbon fibre reinforced epoxy composite, the first is fibre matrix interfacial failure, followed by fibre fracture, and subsequently matrix splitting. The application of AE technique has been applied successfully to characterise the development of failure.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bearings (Machinery)</field><field name="subject">Laminated fabrics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the appropriateness of internet technology for inter-firm communication in the Thai tourism industry.</field><field name="creator">Vatanasakdakul, Savanid, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to investigate the appropriateness of B2B technology transfer in developing countries, particularly in Thailand. This study seeks an understanding of how Thai culture affects the appropriateness of B2B technology adoption for inter-firm communication in Thailand. A research model was developed for investigating this issue via a strategic fit lens. The proposed model extended the Task-technology fit (TTF) model by Goodhue and Thompson (1995) by integrating interorganisational theories and theories of national culture. This research takes the view that, to achieve a high utilisation of B2B technology adoption, firms in developing countries need to adopt effective IT strategies that align with their local environment. Hence, this research proposes that cultural fit is a major influence on the perception of appropriateness of B2B technology adoption in Thailand.  The study was conducted using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The first study, the qualitative study, was conducted as a preliminary study by interviewing officials in the Thai government and companies in the tourism industry. The objectives were to explore and identify the cultural dimensions that impact on the appropriateness of B2B technology adoption in Thailand. The resulting dimensionalities of cultural fit are: personal relationships; long-term relationships; interorganisational trust; ability to communicate in the English language and materialism. The second study was conducted via a quantitative approach and scales were developed to validate the proposed research model. Data were collected through a survey questionnaire, and analysed by using Structural Equation Modeling with Partial Least Squares (PLS) method.  This study found that cultural fit does influence the appropriateness of B2B technology adoption in Thailand. A better perceived fit between Thai culture and B2B technology results in higher technology utilisation. In addition, the results of moderating effect analysis found that, although task-technology fit had no direct impact on utilisation, task-technology fit did have indirect impact on utilisation by moderating the impact of culture. Nevertheless, the results indicated that task-technology fit still had a greater impact on firms' perceived performance than utilisation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thai culture.</field><field name="subject">Structural Equation Modeling.</field><field name="subject">B2B technology.</field><field name="subject">Thai tourism industry.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rethinking quality of care in the context of patient complaints: the response of a hospital organisation to complaints in Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Hsieh, Yahui Sophie, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The study explores the management of patient complaints at a private hospital in Taiwan (i.e. the Case Hospital). The case study aims to identify factors which influence the response of the hospital to patient complaints and whether it incorporates information derived from patient complaints in its quality improvement efforts.  The study was conducted in two stages. The first stage was a cross-institutional comparison of quality management systems between a hospital in Britain and a hospital in Taiwan. The study explored how these hospitals managed patient complaints and whether they took such feedback into account in reviewing priority of services. The second stage included a detailed case study of the hospital in Taiwan (the Case Hospital), exploring the hospital???s responses to patient complaints, along with the factors which may have influenced these responses.  The study was designed to triangulate data through the use of a multi-method approach to derive converging or diverging empirical evidence from a variety of data sources. Data were obtained through interviews with hospital senior managers, a senior social worker, government officials, and managers of non-government organisations. A questionnaire survey was administered to managers, and the Critical Incident Technique (CIT), along with observation, was applied, as well as analysis of documents. Principally, this study adopts the techniques of thematic analysis (Lincoln and Guba, 1985a) with an interpretivist approach to analyse the empirical data.  The results of the study indicate that although the Case Hospital appeared to be concerned about patients??? complaints, it did not respond in a systematic way to the messages received. Hospital managers appeared to merely attempt to pacify complainants while ignoring the underlying causes of their complaints. It was evident that there were no protocols in place as to how staff should handle complaints, and as a result, the hospital was failing to use the information about systemic problems provided by patient complaints to make any sustainable quality improvement. In other words, whilst the Case Hospital was attempting to resolve patient complaints on a case-by-case basis (doing things right for the patient, or in the terms of Argyris (1990), using ???single-loop??? learning), it was not reviewing or acting on these complaints as a collective group to identify systemic problems and deficiencies (doing right things, i.e. ???double-loop??? learning).  The study found that the organisational response to complaints was influenced by features of the complaints and institutional attributes. Features of complaints affected the response pathways to complaints, such as patients??? status, the severity of complaints, and the nature of complaints. In terms of systemic features, the organisational response to complaints was influenced by the interaction between managerial factors (e.g. organisational structure and organisational culture), operational factors (e.g. documentation and communication), and technical factors (e.g. complaints handling techniques and information systems). The values of the top hospital management have been recognised as a powerful influence on these factors. Generally, results show that although the Case Hospital tends to take action to address individual complainants, there was no evidence of sustainable quality improvement within the organisation as a result of complaints data.  The study recommends that if the hospital intends to use patient complaints to improve quality of clinical care, a ???double-loop??? learning strategy should be adopted within the organisation. This study also argues that governments need to take more responsibility and demand more accountability from hospitals, in terms of complaints handling. The individual hospital would thus be able to respond to patient complaints in a systemic way. Hospitals need to be more accountable when using patient complaints to drive quality improvement in the future.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">patient complaints</field><field name="subject">quality improvement</field><field name="subject">case study</field><field name="subject">hospitals</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="subject">complaints (administrative procedures)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The treatment engagement model as a tool for identifying problematic doctor behaviour. Three case studies.</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Judith Ronelle, Graduate Program in Professional Ethics, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploration of professional behaviour in health care settings, using a Model of Treatment Engagement that is developed as a tool for ethics critique. The Model is tested and refined using data on: a psychiatric ???treatment??? carried out on over 1,127 occasions in a 15 - 40 bed non-acute hospital during the period 1961-1979; the problematic withdrawal of all life-support from a 37 year old man who had suffered acute brain trauma some five days previously, in a tertiary hospital in March 2000; and a clinical experiment recently proposed for the emergency setting and intended to encompass five hospitals and the NSW Ambulance Service. In each case, the Model proves useful in identifying the shift from the treatment paradigm and the ethical imperative of ensuring the patient (or his/her agent) appreciates the difference between what is proposed and what would normally be done. It reveals how doctors who dealt with the patient but did not decide on treatment contributed to ethically troublesome practice. It clarifies how having multiple doctor players in the treatment situation gave rise to the need to suppress dissenting views.  Doctors who were close enough to the action to comprehend its nature, by not dissenting, reinforced the problematic choice for the actor and validated it in the eyes of observers. The lack of dissent at the level of doctors working under supervision, appeared to be a function of institutional arrangements. At the consultant level, there was evidence of pressure to concur from other consultants and indirect evidence of a fear of ostracism. The public responses in the two modern cases point to there being a strong idea in Sydney???s medical community that dissent should not be publicly displayed once a decision on how to treat has been made.  I conclude there are two steps to reviewing ethically problematic treatment situations. The first consists of identifying the shift from the treatment paradigm. The second consists of establishing why the problematic choice is translated into action. The Treatment Engagement Model is put forward as a useful tool for both these analyses.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consent</field><field name="subject">clinical trials</field><field name="subject">treatment engagement model</field><field name="subject">problematic doctor behaviour</field><field name="subject">medical ethics</field><field name="subject">analytic tool</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proddy-dogs, cattleticks and ecumaniacs: aspects of sectarianism in New South Wales, 1945-1981</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Benjamin, History, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis studies sectarianism in New South Wales from 1947 through to 1981. This was a period of intense change in Australian socio-cultural history, as well as in the history of religious cultures, both within Australia and internationally. Sectarianism, traditionally a significant force in Australian socio-cultural life, was significantly affected by the many changes of this period: the religious revival of the 1950s, the rise of ecumenism and the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, as well as postwar mass-immigration, the politics of education, increasing secularism in Australian society and the Goulburn schools closure of 1962, which was both a symptom of the diminishing significance of sectarianism as well as a force that accelerated its demise.   While the main study of sectarianism in this thesis ends with the 1981 High Court judgment upholding the constitutionality of state aid to non-government schools, this thesis also traces the lingering significance of sectarianism in Australian society through to the early twenty-first century through oral history and memoir. This thesis offers a contribution to historical understanding of sectarianism, examining the significance of sectarianism as a discursive force in Australian society in the context of social, political and religious cultures of the period.  It argues that while the significant social and religious changes of the period eroded the discursive power of sectarianism in Australian society, this does not mean sectarianism simply vanished from Australian society. While sectarianism became increasingly insignificant in mainstream Australian socio-political life in this period, sectarianism -- both as a discourse and ideology -- lingered in social memory and in some religious cultures.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic Church -- Relations -- Protestant churches -- History -- 20th century -- New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Church and state -- History -- 20th century -- New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Religion and politics -- New South Wales -- 20th century.</field><field name="subject">Protestants -- 20th century -- New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Catholics -- New South Wales -- 20th century.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of secondary lymphoid organs in baff induced autoimmune disease</field><field name="creator">Fletcher, Carrie-Anne, St Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sj?gren?s syndrome (SS) are both heterogeneous autoimmune diseases with strong B cell aspects. A proportion of SLE and SS patients exhibit elevated serum BAFF (B cell activating factor of the TNF family); BAFF plays a key role in B cell homeostasis, survival and tolerance. BAFF transgenic (Tg) mice develop nephritis and salivary gland destruction that resemble aspects of SLE and SS respectively. Autoimmune disease development in BAFF Tg mice correlates with marginal zone (MZ) B cell expansion and the abnormal presence of MZ-like B cells outside of the spleen. The role of MZ B cells in BAFF induced autoimmune disease was analysed by crossing BAFF Tg mice with Lymphotoxin-&#946; knockout mice (creating LT&#946;&#61508;-BTg mice) which lack most peripheral lymph nodes, and also lack MZ B cells as a result of disrupted splenic architecture. LT&#946;&#61508;-BTg mice were not protected against nephritis but exhibited reduced salivary gland infiltration and destruction. Indicating that the development of sialadenitis but not nephritis in BAFF Tg mice is MZ B cell dependent. Nephritis development in LT&#946;&#61508;-BTg mice was associated with the detection of B-1 B cells in the inflamed kidneys. As B-1a B cell survival is dependent on the spleen, the contribution of B-1a B cells to nephritis development in BAFF Tg mice was assessed by crossing BAFF Tg mice to congenitally asplenic Hox11-/- mice (creating Hox11 &#61508;-BTg mice). The absence of a spleen and B-1a B cells in Hox11&#61508;-BTg mice delayed the nephritis development. In contrast, splenectomy of BAFF Tg mice at 12 weeks of age did not alter nephritis onset. In these mice B-1a B cells persisted in the peritoneal cavity and MZ-like B cells were detected in the periphery 8 months after surgery. In summary, nephritis development in BAFF Tg mice is unaltered by the absence of MZ B cells, but delayed in the absence of a spleen, MZ and B-1a B cells. Thus, B-1a and B-1b B cells may be potential targets for the treatment of nephritis in SLE patients with elevated BAFF.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autoimmunity.</field><field name="subject">BAFF.</field><field name="subject">MZ B cells.</field><field name="subject">Spleen.</field><field name="subject">B cells.</field><field name="subject">Autoimmune diseases.</field><field name="subject">Autoimmune diseases -- Animal models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40867</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evidence on short and long run returns for equity offerings on the stock exchange of Thailand</field><field name="creator">Pamornmast, Chayongkan, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Two important findings in the IPO literature, IPO's underpricing and poor long run stock returns, are investigated by using the sample of IPOs completed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) from 1994 to 1999. The evidence suggests that Thai IPOs are underpriced and have poor long run stock returns. Rock 's (1986) model is employed to explain the underpricing of Thai IPOs. Rock's model is supported by the evidence of Thai IPOs. 	Past market conditions and the stock liquidity of the IPOs' industries are the main factors which affect investor demand for IPO shares. IPOs which go public in the hot market conditions (periods with high past market return) and IPOs which come from liquid industries (industries which have high stock turnover) attract more investor demand. These two factors are also positively correlated with IPO first day return. This suggests that investors have higher demand for IPOs which go public in the hot market conditions and IPOs which come from liquid industries because these IPOs are underpriced, and the underpricing of these IPOs is corrected during the first trading day.	IPOs with low investor demand underperform their benchmarks in the long run. On the contrary, the long run returns of IPOs with high investor demand are not significantly different from their benchmarks. One possible explanation for the underperformance of IPOs with low investor demand is that these IPOs may be illiquid. The lack of demand during the first trading day may cause their first closing price to be different from their intrinsic value. This difference is gradually adjusted in the long run leading to the underperformance of these IPOs. This hypothesis is supported by the evidence. The sample of rights offerings announced in the SET between 1994 and 1999 also supports the role of liquidity in explaining the poor long run performance of issuers. 	The change in operating performance of IPOs from the IPO-year to the post-IPO years also has some power in explaining the long run underperformance of IPOs. IPOs which perform more badly after going public have poor long run returns.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IPO.</field><field name="subject">SEO.</field><field name="subject">Stock exchanges -- Thailand.</field><field name="subject">Equity offering.</field><field name="subject">Stock prices.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40578</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitric oxide-mediated differentiation and dispersal in bacterial biofilms</field><field name="creator">Barraud, Nicolas, School of Biotechnology And Biomolecular Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">In nature bacteria predominantly live on surfaces, in matrix-encased communities called biofilms. Biofilm formation displays dynamic developmental patterns resembling those of multicellular organisms. Using cooperative traits such as cell-cell signaling, bacteria in biofilms form complex architectures, known as microcolonies, in which cells become highly differentiated from their planktonic counterparts. Microcolonies are generally highly tolerant to bactericides, rendering biofilms extremely difficult to eradicate. The aim of this study was to investigate the last, and least understood stage of biofilm development, which involves the coordinated dispersal of single cells that revert to a free-swimming planktonic phenotype and escape from the biofilm. Strategies to induce biofilm dispersal are of interest due to their potential to prevent biofilms and biofilm-related infections.  In the model organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa, reproducible patterns of cell death and dispersal can occur within biofilm structures, leaving behind empty or hollow microcolonies. These events were previously linked with the appearance of oxidative and/or nitrosative stress in mature microcolonies. Here, the involvement of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates in biofilm development and dispersal processes was investigated in both mono- and mixed-species biofilms. By using specific fluorescent dyes and P. aeruginosa mutant strains, nitric oxide (NO), a by-product of anaerobic respiration and an important messenger molecule in biological systems, was found to play a major role in P. aeruginosa biofilm dispersal. Further, the results demonstrated that exposure to physiological, non-toxic concentrations of NO (in the low nanomolar range) causes biofilm dispersal in P. aeruginosa and restores its vulnerability to conventional antimicrobials. By using microarray techniques, NO was shown to induce global changes in genetic expression, including enhanced metabolic activity and motility and decreased adhesion and virulence in P. aeruginosa biofilms. The regulatory pathway implicated c-di-GMP, a newly discovered messenger molecule involved in the transition from sessility to motility in many bacterial species. NO-mediated dispersal was also observed in other single- and multi-species biofilms of clinically and industrially relevant organisms. Hence, the combined exposure to NO and bactericides was identified as a potential novel strategy for the removal of microbial communities, providing a low cost and environmentally safe solution to biofilm control.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biofilms.</field><field name="subject">Differentiation.</field><field name="subject">Dispersal.</field><field name="subject">Nitric oxide.</field><field name="subject">Nitric oxide -- Physiological effect.</field><field name="subject">Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</field><field name="subject">Pseudomonas -- Genetics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution of ocular parameters measured by optical coherence tomography in a childhood population.</field><field name="creator">Wang, Xiu Ying, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Purpose: To document the distribution of macular, retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness and optic disc parameters, as measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT) in a population-based sample of young persons and to examine the relationship of these measurements to ocular variables (spherical equivalent refraction [SER] and axial length) and systemic variables (age, gender, anthropometry, ethnicity and birth parameters). Methods: A stratified random cluster sample of 6- and 12-year-old school students from across the Sydney metropolitan region were surveyed and examined using non-contact methods (including biometric measurements with the IOL Master and Canon RK-F1) to determine axial length and SER. The 3rd generation Optical Coherence Tomography instrument (Zeiss Stratus OCT, Dublin, CA, USA) was used to measure macular and RNFL thickness and major optic disc parameters in this sample. Ethnicity and birth parameters were derived using questionnaires. Anthropometric parameters, such as height and weight, were measured using standard methods. Results: The thickness of the foveal, central, inner macular, outer macular and macular volume parameters was normally distributed in both age cohorts. The temporal quadrant was thinner than all other quadrants at both the inner and outer macular regions. The central and inner macula was significantly thicker in boys than in girls, and in Caucasian than in East Asian children. The inner and outer macular regions were slightly, but significantly, thinner with increasing axial length, or myopic refraction. On the other hand, these corresponding regions were significantly thicker with more hyperopic SER. RNFL thickness and RNFLestimated integral were normally distributed in both age groups. RNFL thickness was thinnest for the temporal quadrant, followed by the nasal, inferior, and superior quadrants. RNFL average thickness was marginally greater in boys than in girls and in East Asian than in Caucasian children. The RNFL was thinner with both greater axial length and less hyperopic refractions. Optic disc, optic cup and neural rim parameters were also normally distributed in this young population. In analyses that adjusted for potential confounders, optic disc area increased significantly with axial length and refraction. Neural rim area increased with axial length. There were minimal gender differences in the two age groups. Most optic disc and optic cup dimensions were significantly larger in East Asian than in Caucasian and Middle Eastern children. The foveal minimum and overall RNFL thickness were similar in both age cohorts, while other retinal regions and optic disc size were slightly larger in the 12- than the 6-year-old children. Amblyopic eyes had greater foveal minimum thickness than the normal fellow eye of individual children and the right eyes of non-amblyopic children. Birth weight and head circumference were positively correlated with both RNFL and macular thickness. Conclusions: Macular thickness, RNFL thickness and optic disc parameters were normally distributed in these two age groups of children. Axial length and refraction were important ocular biometric determinants of macular thickness and RNFL thickness. Significant ethnic differences were also demonstrated. RNFL average thickness was also positively associated with optic disc area. Central macular thickness increased in amblyopia. These findings have implications for the interpretation of OCT measurements in research and clinical practice in both children and adult.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic update for operating systems</field><field name="creator">Baumann, Andrew, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Patches to modern operating systems, including bug fixes and security updates, and the reboots and downtime they require, cause tremendous problems for system users and administrators. The aim of this research is to develop a model for dynamic update of operating systems, allowing a system to be patched without the need for a reboot or other service interruption. In this work, a model for dynamic update based on operating system modularity is developed and evaluated using a prototype implementation for the K42 operating system. The prototype is able to update kernel code and data structures, even when the interfaces between kernel modules change. When applying an update, at no point is the system's entire execution blocked, and there is no additional overhead after an update has been applied. The base runtime overhead is also very low. An analysis of the K42 revision history shows that approximately 79% of past performance and bug-fix changes to K42 could be converted to dynamic updates, and the proportion would be even higher if the changes were being developed for dynamic update. The model also extends to other systems such as Linux and BSD, that although structured modularly, are not strictly object-oriented like K42.  The experience with this approach shows that dynamic update for operating systems is feasible given a sufficiently-modular system structure, allows maintenance patches and updates to be applied without disruption, and need not constrain system performance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer science.</field><field name="subject">Operating systems (Computers)</field><field name="subject">Dynamic update.</field><field name="subject">Software maintenance.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Naturally-occurring chemical tracers in seawater and their application to verifying mid-ocean ballast water exchange.</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Kathleen Ruth, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Recent regulation mandates that ships conduct mid ocean ballast water exchange (BWE) prior to discharging foreign ballast in territorial waters of Australia, the U.S. and elsewhere. The enforcement of ballast water exchange legislation is undermined, however, by a lack of sensitive and reliable methods for verifying compliance. One way to assess compliance is to compare the concentrations of chemical tracers in ballast tanks with their known distributions in the open ocean. In this work, dissolved organic matter and trace elements are investigated as potential tracers of mid-ocean ballast water exchange on commercial voyages in the North Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The optical properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) are frequently used as tracers of water masses in bays and estuaries. Characterization of the underlying fluorescence spectra in seawater dissolved organic matter was performed using parallel factor analysis, allowing the identification of at least nine independently varying fluorescent components present in varying concentrations in the ocean and in ballast water. Two of the humic components were terrestrial in origin and their signals could be traced in the open ocean (Pacific and Atlantic) at levels of approximately 1.5% of riverine concentrations. One humic terrestrial component was sufficient for predicting the coastal vs. oceanic source of most ballast water samples, suggesting that single and dual channel fluorometers could be optimized for verifying ballast water exchange. Barium, manganese and phosphorus were also investigated as potential tracers. Measurements of Ba and P obtained via engine-cooling pipes on commercial vessels were consistent with previous oceanographic measurements. While Ba behaved conservatively in ballast water, concentrations of phosphorus fluctuated and Mn was removed in ballast tanks over time. Ba and P demonstrated considerable promise as ballast water tracers, exhibiting predictable concentrations in exchanged ballast tanks, given a priori knowledge of the ocean (Atlantic versus Pacific) in which BWE was performed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ballast water exchange.</field><field name="subject">Chemical tracers.</field><field name="subject">Fluorescence.</field><field name="subject">Barium.</field><field name="subject">Manganese.</field><field name="subject">Phosphorus.</field><field name="subject">Seawater -- Analysis.</field><field name="subject">Ballast water -- Environmental aspects -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Architectural support for security and reliability in embedded processors</field><field name="creator">Ragel, Roshan Gabriel, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Security and reliability in processor based systems are concerns requiring adroit solutions. Security is often compromised by code injection attacks, jeopardizing even ???trusted software???. Reliability is of concern, where unintended code is executed in modern processors with ever smaller feature sizes and low voltage swings causing bit flips. Countermeasures by software-only approaches increase code size and therefore significantly reduce performance. Hardware assisted approaches use additional hardware monitors and thus incur considerably high hardware cost and have scalability problems. Considering reliability and security issues during the design of an embedded system has its advantages as this overcomes the limitations of existing solutions. The research work presented in this thesis combines two elements: one, defining a hardware software design framework for reliability and security monitoring at the granularity of micro-instructions, and two, applying this framework for real world problems. At a given time, a processor executes only a few instructions and large part of the processor is idle. Utilizing these idling hardware components by sharing them with the monitoring hardware, to perform security and reliability monitoring reduces   the impact of the monitors on hardware cost. Using micro-instruction routines within the machine instructions, allows us to share most of the monitoring hardware. Therefore, our technique requires little hardware overhead in comparison to having additional hardware blocks outside the processor. This reduction in overhead is due to maximal sharing of hardware resources of the processor. Our framework is superior to software-only techniques as the monitoring routines are formed with micro-instructions and therefore reduces code size and execution time overheads, since they occur in parallel with machine instructions. This dissertation makes four significant contributions to the field of security and reliability on embedded processor research and they are: (i) proposed a security and reliability framework for embedded processors that could be included into its design phase; (ii) shown that inline (machine instruction level) monitoring will detect common security attacks (four inline monitors against common attacks cost 9.21% area and 0.67% performance, as opposed to previous work where an external monitor with two monitoring modules costs 15% area overhead); (iii) illustrated that basic block check-summing for code integrity is much simpler and efficient than currently proposed integrity violation detectors which address code injection attacks (this costs 5.03% area increase and 3.67% performance penalty with a single level control flow checking, as opposed to previous work where the area overhead is 5.59%, which needed three control flow levels of integrity checking); and (iv) shown that hardware assisted control flow checking implemented during the design of a processor is much cheaper and effective than software only approaches (this approach costs 0.24-1.47% performance and 3.59% area overheads, as opposed to previous work that costs 53.5-99.5% performance).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Security</field><field name="subject">Reliability</field><field name="subject">Embedded Systems</field><field name="subject">Computer Architecture</field><field name="subject">Embedded Processors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28797</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of genetic variation in gene expression</field><field name="creator">Chan, Eva King-Fan, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Variations in gene expression have long been hypothesised to be the major cause of individual differences. An initial focus of this research thesis is to elucidate the genetic regulatory architecture of gene expression. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping analyses have been performed on expression levels of over 22,000 mRNAs from three tissues of a panel of recombinant inbred mice. These analyses are "single-locus" where "linkage" (i.e. significant correlation) between an expression trait and a putative eQTL is considered independently of other loci. Major conclusions from these analyses are:  1.	Gene expression is mainly influenced by genetic (sequence) variations that act in trans rather than in cis; 2.	Subsets of genes are controlled by master regulators that influence multiple genes; 3.	Gene expression is a polygenic trait with multiple regulators.  Single-locus mapping analyses are not designed for detecting multiple regulators of gene expression, and so observation of multiple-linkages (i.e. one expression trait mapped to multiple eQTLs) formed the basis of the second objective of this research project: to investigate the relationship between multiple-linkages and genotype pattern-association. A locus-pair is said to have associated genotype patterns if they have similar inheritance pattern across a panel of individuals, and these are attributed to one of fours sources: 1.	linkage disequilibrium between loci located on the same chromosome; 2.	non-syntenic association; 3.	random association; 4.	un-associated. To understand the validity of multiple-linkages observed in single-locus mapping studies, a newly developed method, bqtl.twolocus, is applied to confirm two-locus effects for a total of 898 out of 1,233 multiple-linkages identified from the three studies mentioned above as well as from seven publicly available eQTL-mapping studies. Combining these results with information of genotype pattern-association, a subset of 478 multiple-linkages has been deduced for which there is high confidence to be real.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gene expression.</field><field name="subject">Expression QTL.</field><field name="subject">Linkage disequilibrium.</field><field name="subject">Non-syntenic association.</field><field name="subject">Genotype pattern association.</field><field name="subject">Variation (Genetics)</field><field name="subject">Gene mapping.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human Papillomavirus in human breast cancer and cellular immortalisation</field><field name="creator">Kan, Chin Yi, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a small, double stranded DNA tumour virus. Infection with HPV normally results in formation of warts. Certain types of HPV, such as type -16 and -18, are shown to have a causal role in the development of uterine cervical cancer, and are so called high risk type HPV. Recently, a role of HPV in breast cancer has been suggested, although a causal role for HPVs in human breast cancer is yet to be demonstrated. The first part of this study investigates the association of HPV with human breast cancer. The results demonstrate that 48% of breast cancers that occurred in Australian women are HPV positive and they are mainly variants of HPV-18. Further analysis shows that HPV positive breast cancer patients are significantly younger than HPV negative patients, suggesting infection with HPV increases the risk of breast cancer development. This is coincidental with increased risk of HPV infection in sexually active young women and provides evidence that HPV has a role in breast cancer development.  The second part of this project investigates the mechanisms by which high risk type HPV oncogenic protein E6, transforms primary human foreskin keratinocytes (natural host cells of HPV). HPV E6 is always expressed in HPV positive cervical carcinoma and results in the degradation of the cellular tumour suppressor protein p53. It is generally believed that HPV E6 contributes to HPV transformation by degradation of p53 protein which leads to cellular immortalisation ? an early step in tumorigenic transformation. Subsequent studies, however, indicate that HPV E6 possesses other functions (such as induction of telomerase activity) which may also be involved in cellular immortalisation. The results of my investigations demonstrate: 1) that degradation of p53 protein is required but is insufficient to immortalise primary cells; 2) that HPV E6 induced telomerase activity is coincidental with an increase in cell culture passage number; 3) that multiple functions of high risk type HPV E6 protein are required for cellular immortalisation.  This finding suggests HPV infection is associated with early onset of breast cancer and that multiple functions of high risk type HPV E6 protein are involved in cellular immortalisation. Further study in both of these areas should provide alternative diagnostic markers, leading to prevention and treatment strategies for HPV positive breast cancer and other cancers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human papillomavirus.</field><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer.</field><field name="subject">Cellular immortalisation.</field><field name="subject">Papillomaviruses.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of microbial Mat communities in meltwater ponds of the McMurdo ice shelf, Antarctica</field><field name="creator">Jungblut, Anne Dorothee, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The investigation presented in this thesis examined the microbial and functional diversity of the meltwater ponds Fresh, Orange and Salt Ponds on the McMurdo Ice Shelf, near Bratina Island, Antarctica. These sites were chosen because of the ecological importance and absence of detailed characterisations of their diversity and function as part of Antarctica?s largest wetland. Particular focus was on cyanobacterial diversity, nitrogen fixation and secondary metabolite production. Using 16S rRNA gene and morphological analysis a large diversity of cyanobacteria (more than 22 phylotypes) was identified with high phylogenetic similarities (up to 99% sequence identity) to cyanobacteria from mats in other regions of Antarctica. In addition biogeographical distributions were identified including potentially endemic and cosmopolitan cyanobacteria. High salinities were also connected to the change and reduction of diversity. Lipid marker analyses were performed targeting hydrocarbons, ether-linked hydrocarbons, methylated fatty acid esters (FAME), wax esters, hopanols and sterols. Lipid biomarker profiles were similar to typical cyanobacteria dominated mats with major input from microorganisms including oxygenic and anoxygenic phototrophs, obligate aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophs that conduct the metabolic processes of fermentation, sulphate reduction, sulphate and iron-oxidation, methanogeneses. Signature lipids indicative of Chloroflexus and archaea, as well as branched aliphatic alkanes with quaternary substituted carbon atoms (BAQCs), were identified for the first time in Fresh, Orange and Salt Ponds. Based on nifH gene analysis, the nitrogen fixing diversity characterised in Orange Pond consisted of cyanobacterial Nostoc sp. as well as firmicutes, beta-, gamma- and delta-proteobacteria. Acetylene reduction assays and nifH gene RNA transcript diversity identified Nostoc sp. as a main contributor of nitrogenase activity in these ponds. Furthermore, analytical methods were used to identify the cyanobacterial secondary metabolites microcystins, although the genetic basis for this production and the toxin producer could not been identified. However non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and polyketide synthases (PKS) genes were identified which could be the genetic basis for novel bioactives.

A move toward risk informed, proactive water system management has occurred over the past decade and is advocated in current international drinking water guidelines. Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) is a tool with potential for aiding health risk management; however the refinement of scientific based practical methods to support that philosophy still requires development. This thesis focused on the water utility, its responsibility to manage microbial water safety, and how probabilistic QMRA may aid in developing management strategies. A framework for waterborne disease risk assessment from urban supply systems was derived and tested on an Australian case study. The main premise was that, in order for risk assessment outcomes to inform the management process, the steps should incorporate the concepts of risk variability, the explicit event conditions that can drive it, and that examination of QMRA sensitivity to various risk scenarios/model uncertainties is undertaken. The identified management uses were: (i) prioritising for attention issues hampering the system's ability to meet or the assessor's ability to interpret against (e.g. knowledge gaps about the system), a water quality health target; and (ii) identifying potential strategies or control points for addressing those issues. Additionally, rarely occurring, high impact, adverse fluctuations in treated water quality (and consumer infection risks), especially from source water contaminant "peaks", are highly, nearly totally, influential over the extent of risks averaged over longer, say annual, periods. As such, a case is made calling for widespread adoption of health targets that refer to tolerable consumer risks per exposure, rather than or as well as the current common practice of expressing targets in terms of risks from exposure over a year or lifetime. Doing so may provide incentive and opportunities for improved management, and the future derivation of specific microbial treatment or treated water quality targets, with a view toward protecting the community from extreme high risk periods associated with disease outbreaks.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Urban water supply systems.</field><field name="subject">water utility.</field><field name="subject">Risk assessment.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fabrication and characterisation of affinity-bound liposomes</field><field name="creator">Tarasova, Anna, Optometry, UNSW</field><field name="description">In considering the concept of surface-immobilised liposomes as a drug release system, two factors need to addressed, the interfacial surface density of the liposomes for maximum drug loading and the stability of these liposomes to allow for controlled drug release. This thesis investigates a multilayer system for the affinity immobilisation of liposomes and their stability to various applied stresses. In the work presented here an allylamine monomer was used to create plasma coatings that were stable, thin and amine-rich. The aging studies using AFM showed these films to rapidly oxidise on exposure to water. The freshly deposited films were used for further surface modifications, by the covalent grafting of PEG layers of different interfacial densities under the conditions of varying polymer solvation. The AFM was used to measure the interaction forces between the grafted PEG layers and modified silica interfaces. It was found that the polydispersity of the PEG species resulted in bridging interactions of ???brush???-like PEG layers with the silica surface. These interactions were screened minimised by increasing the ionic strength of the solution. Although the densely grafted PEG layers were found to be highly protein-resistant by the XPS and QCM-D some minor protein-polymer adhesions were observed by the AFM.  The densely anchored biotinylated PEG chains served as an optimum affinity platform for affinity-docking of NeutrAvidinTM molecules, which assembled in a rigid, 2-D layer as confirmed by the QCM-D. The submonolayer surface density of NeutrAvidin, as determined by Europium-labelling, was attributed to steric hindrance of the immobilised molecules. The final protein layer enabled specific binding of biotin-PEG-liposomes as a highly dissipative, dense and stable layer verified by tapping mode AFM and QCM-D. We found that these liposomes were also stable under a range of stresses induced by the shearing effects of water, silica probe and HSA layer at increased loads and velocities. The frictional response of the liposome layer also demonstrated the viscoelasticity and stability of these surface immobilised liposomes. Finally, the minimal adhesive interaction forces, as measured by the AFM, demonstrated the repellency of these liposomes to commonly found proteins, such as HSA.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liposomes.</field><field name="subject">AFM.</field><field name="subject">PEG.</field><field name="subject">Friction.</field><field name="subject">Interaction forces.</field><field name="subject">Chemical affinity.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An integrated framework for managing eBusiness collaborative projects.</field><field name="creator">Cameron, Julie, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">An increasing number of ebusiness projects are undertaken as voluntary collaborations of independent organizations. These projects are known as &#8216;ebusiness collaborative projects&#8217;. Industry sources estimate only about 20% of these projects achieve their stated objectives due partly to inadequate project management. The volunteer and virtual nature of the collaboration and relationships among the participating organizations means existing project management frameworks and methods are not appropriate because they assume project management has authority, or that projects occur within a single organization. This thesis investigates the nature of ebusiness collaborative projects to provide insight into management approaches that increase the likelihood of success. The research questions are: What concepts need to be addressed in a framework capable of supporting effective management and providing an understanding of ebusiness collaborative project outcomes? Is there an existing framework with this capability? Are the concepts supported by empirical evidence and a sound theoretical base? Can these concepts be used to form an integrated framework suitable for use by practitioners? A qualitative meta analysis of 6 published case studies identified characteristics that explained challenges specific to ebusiness collaborative project management. Empirical research identified concepts that need to be addressed in a management framework, namely: 3 organizational levels &#8211; organizations, teams and representatives; 3 stages of the eBusiness Collaborative Project Lifecycle&#169; and; 4 management meta factors - motivation, capability, communication and coordination These concepts were supported by theory. In the absence of an existing framework, the concepts were used to develop the Integrated Framework for Managing eBusiness Collaborative Projects. Five additional case studies were used to evaluate the Integrated Framework and its usefulness for practitioners. Findings indicate the Integrated Framework is capable of supporting effective management and providing an understanding of the outcomes of ebusiness collaborative projects within the Australian context. This thesis contributes to knowledge by integrating and building on theory and existing research about project management, collaborations and virtuality and applying these findings to a real world environment. The Integrated Framework enhances industry best practice and may apply to all collaborative projects in which participating organizations volunteer to work towards an agreed objective or outcome.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No key words available on bibliographic record in Aleph.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29149</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of personality on responses to stressors: an examination of the Grossarth-Maticek personality inventory</field><field name="creator">Caponecchia, Carlo, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Grossarth-Maticek and colleagues presented longitudinal evidence for personality Type being related to disease. Type 1s (cancer prone) and Type 2s (CHD prone) were proposed to be dependent on others, in contrast to the autonomous Type 4s, who had a lower mortality rate at follow-up. Stress was the mechanism proposed to account for the effects of personality on disease, yet this claim has not been systematically investigated. Four studies compared responses of Type 1, 2 and 4 individuals to stress and non-stress tasks. Types 1 and 2 showed increased salivary cortisol responses to an uncontrollable maths stress task (relative to control) compared to Type 4s, and scored higher on perceived stress, state-anxiety, and measures of negative mood, consistent with the implications of the Grossarth-Maticek hypothesis. No significant differences were evident between the Types in response to progressive muscle relaxation, suggesting stress is necessary for Type differences to emerge. Further, Types 1 and 2 responded differently to different stressors (maths vs. exam), arguing against criticisms that Types 1 and 2 are indistinguishable. The relation between Grossarth-Maticek Type subscales was further clarified through their correlations with each other (controlling for mood, stress and social desirability), and with the Lifestyle Defense Mechanisms (LDM) inventory, a psychometric refinement of the Grossarth-Maticek scales. A prospective study examining mortality rates in a sample exposed to environmental noise stressors revealed no prediction of death or cause of death by Grossarth-Maticek Type. This may have been due to the relative youth of the sample, short (7 year) follow-up period, and consequently low death rate. The current research is the first to show different responses to different stressors between Types 1 and 2, and revealed converging evidence for the claim that stress is the mechanism for Type effects on disease. Additionally, theoretical issues in conceptions of stress, and models of the relation between the Types, stress and disease were considered. This project suggests that after a history of criticisms, the Grossarth-Maticek typology should be re-considered for its public health implications, and along with the LDM inventory, should be considered for further investigation of the relation between personality variables and disease.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Personality tests</field><field name="subject">diseases.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scanner data and the construction of price indices.</field><field name="creator">Ivancic, Lorraine, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores whether scanner data can be used to inform Consumer Price Index (CPI) construction, with particular reference to the issues of substitution bias and choice of aggregation dimensions. The potential costs and benefits of using scanner data are reviewed. Existing estimates of substitution bias are found to show considerable variation.  An Australian scanner data set is used to estimate substitution bias for six different aggregation methods and for fixed base and superlative indexes. Direct and chained indexes are also calculated. Estimates of substitution bias are found to be highly sensitive to both the method of aggregation used and whether direct or chained indexes were used. The ILO (2004) recommends the use of dissimilarity indexes to determine the issue of when to chain. This thesis provides the first empirical study of dissimilarity indexes in this context.  The results indicate that dissimilarity indexes may not be sufficient to resolve the issue. A Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) index provides an approximate estimate of substitution-bias-free price change, without the need for current period expenditure weights. However, an elasticity parameter is needed. Two methods, referred to as the algebraic and econometric methods, were used to estimate the elasticity parameter. The econometric approach involved the estimation of a system of equations proposed by Diewert (2002a). This system has not been estimated previously. The results show a relatively high level of substitution at the elementary aggregate level, which supports the use a Jevons index, rather than Carli or Dutot indexes, at this level. Elasticity parameter estimates were found to vary considerably across time, and statistical testing showed that elasticity parameter estimates were significantly different across estimation methods.  Aggregation is an extremely important issue in the compilation of the CPI. However, little information exists about  'appropriate' aggregation methods. Aggregation is typically recommended over 'homogenous' units. An hedonic framework is used to test for item homogeneity across four supermarket chains and across all stores within each chain. This is a novel approach. The results show that treating the same good as homogenous across stores which belong to the same chain may be recommended.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scanner data.</field><field name="subject">Consumer price index.</field><field name="subject">Inflation.</field><field name="subject">Elasticity of substitution.</field><field name="subject">Aggregation.</field><field name="subject">Consumer price indexes -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Consumer price indexes -- Methodology.</field><field name="subject">Price indexes -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Price indexes -- Methodology.</field><field name="subject">Prices -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Prices -- Statistical methods.</field><field name="subject">Scanning systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40782</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Long term housing prices in Australia and some economic perspectives</field><field name="creator">Stapledon, Nigel David, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis constructs, principally from primary sources, a long term time series for house and land prices for Sydney and Melbourne, and house price and rental yield series for Australia. These new series span the period 1880-1965 and give an historical perspective beyond the period from 1970 for which existing house price time series begin for Australia and for most of the world. The price series indicates that the modern experience (i.e. since the 1970s) of a significant upward trend in real prices differs markedly from the experience in the first half of the 20th century when house prices moved very little. The thesis then takes several approaches to explaining the apparent shift in direction in the mid 20th century. The first approach examines house prices in terms of demand and supply variables. Urban theory says that demographic and income factors are critical. However, assessed over this long time span, these demand factors do not offer a satisfactory explanation. Additionally, it is found that there is no cointegrating relationship between prices and income. Rather, it appears that supply factors have probably been the pivotal influence in explaining the shift in direction, consistent with a growing literature which focuses on the role of regulation and other constraints on supply. In Australia???s case, government policies imposing capital contributions on the cost of land appear to be a major factor. The second approach taken is to view housing in terms of asset pricing as more typically applied to the equity market by Campbell and Shiller (1988) and others. A central debate is whether or not there has been a structural fall in the equity yield and given the parallel fall in the house yield, this question is posed for housing. The thesis finds that tax and other factors can explain a structural decline in the housing yield. The house rental yield appears to be a better predictor of future rental growth and a negative predictor of future returns.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationship between students??? approaches to learning and the development of clinical reasoning ability</field><field name="creator">Tetik, Cihat, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study investigates the relationship between learning approaches and the development of clinical reasoning ability. The main questions for the study were: Is there a statistically significant relationship between students??? learning approaches and development of clinical reasoning ability? If there is a relationship between approaches to learning and development of clinical reasoning ability, which students develop this ability faster? And How does learning approach change relate to the development of reasoning ability? The Revised Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire (R-SPQ-2F) was used in order to evaluate participants??? learning approaches and Diagnostic Thinking Inventory (DTI) to measure participants??? diagnostic thinking ability. In order to determine changes of learning approaches, the same students were invited to fill out the same questionnaires one year later. This quantitative study was followed by a qualitative inquiry including in-depth interviews aimed at exploring the association of a change in learning approach score with the development of clinical reasoning ability. These interviews also explored the factors influencing learning approaches of these students. Those students with the greatest change in R-SPQ-2F scores between the two surveys were selected for interview. Analysis of the findings of both the quantitative and qualitative phases of this research leads the researcher to conclude that; - there is a correlation between ongoing learning approaches and the development of clinical reasoning ability; this correlation is positive if the approach is deep and it is negative if the approach is surface, - progress towards either end of the learning approach continuum is associated with observation of experts, reasoning practice and/or feedback from experts, and - progress towards either end of the learning approach continuum seems an earlier and better indicator of developing reasoning ability than categorization of learning approach because both learning approach change and the factor causing this change were associated with the development of clinical reasoning ability. This study contributes to understanding of the importance of ongoing learning approaches and the development of clinical reasoning ability by encouraging deep learning approach characteristics. Factors affecting learning approaches are also associated with the development of clinical reasoning ability. Their effect is more than expected.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of platinum, iridium, and hafnium to nickel-aluminium alloys under cyclic oxidation conditions.</field><field name="creator">Kartono, Rahmat, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A thermally grown oxide (TGO) such as the alumina scale formed on a bondcoat enhances the oxidation and corrosion resistance of thermal barrier coating (TBC)- bondcoat-superalloy substrate systems. As the external alumina scale lies between the thermal barrier coating and bondcoat, its first spallation and subsequent TBC delamination become critical. Once the external alumina scale spalls, it will spall together with the TBC, leaving the system with no temperature barrier protection. Operational factors such as thermal cycling conditions, water vapour in the oxidation atmosphere, and alloying elements comprising the bondcoat system affect alumina scale adherence. Another problem that arises for the majority of bondcoat systems, &#946; (Ni,Pt)Al and MCrAlY (M=Metal), are rich in aluminium. This causes aluminium to diffuse into the substrate, enriching it with aluminium during service, transforming phases in the substrate alloying system.  The purpose of this study was to develop bondcoat materials that promote formation of a strongly adherent TGO, but have an aluminium content near the substrate composition. Cyclic oxidation experiments were performed with Ni-Al, Ni-Pt-Al, and Ni-Pt-Al-Ir alloys in dry air and air-12%H2O. Thermal cycles of 1 hr at 1200OC and 10 minutes at 80OC were carried out in flowing gases at a total pressure of 1 atm. Experiments in N2- 12%H2O were performed only on Ni-Al binary alloys. Binary Ni-Al cast alloys were tested for fundamental study purposes, while Ni-Pt-Al and Ni-Pt-Al-Ir cast alloys were intended to be models for aluminide coatings, with attention focused on &#947;+&#947;' -Ni-(20 to 23)Al.  Comparisons were made with &#946;-Ni-50Al, as it forms an external alumina scale and was found to have the smallest weight loss rate during testing of binary alloys. Assessments of Pt and Pt-Ir additions, with and without hafnium, to the &#947;+&#947;' binary alloy were made. Compared to binary alloys, platinum was found to reduce the total weight loss caused by scale spallation. Experiments in air-12%H2O led to more rapid weight loss than in dry air. This was due to enhanced spallation. However, the degradation rate was slower than in platinum-free alloys exposed to the same atmosphere.  Partial replacement of platinum with iridium was found to improve alloy scale adherence during exposure in both dry and wet air. Addition of 1wt% hafnium was found to reduce oxide thickness and increase the oxide adherence simultaneously. The hafnium addition was essential in order to reduce spallation rate in wet air.  Water vapour in the presence of oxygen generally increased the spallation rate. It weakened the oxide metal interface, causing subsequent spallation to be increased, but only if the gas had access to the alloy-scale interface. Water vapour did not affect the spallation rate of the strongly adherent oxide grown on Ni-22Al-30Pt+1wt%Hf and Ni- 20Al-15Pt-10Ir+1wt%Hf.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sealing compounds.</field><field name="subject">Nickel-aluminum alloys.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40553</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The informativeness of dividends and franking credits</field><field name="creator">Ruddock, Caitlin Maxine Swanson, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis I investigate whether two clear and simple indicators, dividends and franking credits, provide users with useful information to assess earnings persistence. Persistence is an important attribute of earnings (Dechow and Schrand 2004). I argue and show earnings persistence is a function of firm life-cycle. Firms can generally be divided into three life stages: establishing profitability, sustainable profitability and declining profitability. Using a simple one-period persistence model I demonstrate that dividends and higher franking credits identify firms in the different stages of the life-cycle. Dividends provide an inherent signal of firms that are in the mature phase of the life-cycle, and hence provide information about earnings persistence. I show firms that pay dividends have persistent profits and losses that reverse. However dividend paying firms are not homogenous. Firms that pay franked dividends have significantly more persistent earnings than firms that pay unfranked dividends. Consistent with higher franking credits identifying more mature firms, fully franked dividend paying firms have significantly less persistent losses than partially franked dividend paying firms. Importantly, my primary results provide an alternative explanation to Hanlon (2005) and add to our understanding of the accrual anomaly. Both Hanlon and my study investigate the informativeness of tax on earnings persistence. I demonstrate that firms that have large differences between the level of franking and accounting income (i.e., pay unfranked dividends while reporting a profit) have large book-tax differences. Such differences in tax and accounting income are a function of the firm life-cycle. Large book-tax differences are not necessarily the result of opportunism (or earnings management). Thus firms with large book-tax differences are typically establishing profitability or entering the declining phase. These firms have less persistence profits, accruals and cash flows than firms with small book-tax differences. I conclude the accrual anomaly is a function of inherent firm characteristics associated with different phases of the life-cycle rather than being a function of earnings management.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dividends</field><field name="subject">franking credits</field><field name="subject">buy-backs</field><field name="subject">earnings persistence</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Teflon degree: a Batesonian-cybernetic study of love in learning.</field><field name="creator">Hungerford, Guy, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Because the first year of university education is for students a concentrated point of turbulence (in the form of failing, dropping out, changing courses or degrees, making changes in future plans and present priorities, and suffering anxieties about the same), it has been the focus of much study by education specialists, along the lines of  "What are we doing wrong?" and "How can we do better?"  "The teflon degree" is a metaphor derived from the image of a mess-preventing armour plating. The assumption that turbulence in the first year is naturally a bad thing fits by extension with an idea that turbulence, mess, and so on are to be avoided. Better than avoidance would be the construction of a system which would make it impossible for such things to happen. "The teflon degree" is a fantasy of a program of study that one can embark on, knowing what one will do and how one will do it, and then slide through, essentially unchanged, "augmented" by the acquisition of skills and qualifications.  This thesis is a critique of the conceptual underpinnings of such an ideal. It is also an evocation of the qualities in university education which are obscured or harmed by the pursuit of such an ideal, foremost among them being love. I argue that love is not a sentimental afterthought, but an essential component of all genuine learning. This critique is carried out through the conceptual framework established by the work of Gregory Bateson in cybernetics.  The empirical component of the thesis is drawn from interviews with individual students; these are intended both to illustrate and to make concrete the theoretical concerns which are its primary focus. With Bateson, both an anthropologist and a philosopher, as my central theorist, I have drawn on both anthropological and philosophical texts in the development of my argument, including Buber, Durkheim, Gaita, Hegel, Murdoch, Sartre, Serres, Simmel, and Weber.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Higher education.</field><field name="subject">Pedagogy.</field><field name="subject">Cybernetics.</field><field name="subject">Learning -- Social aspects.</field><field name="subject">Educational sociology.</field><field name="subject">Affective education.</field><field name="subject">Learning, Psychology of.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language extension via dynamically extensible compilers.</field><field name="creator">Seefried, Sean, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation provides the motivation for and evidence in favour of an approach to language extension via dynamic loading of plug-ins. There is a growing realisation that language features are often a superior choice to software libraries for implementing applications. Among the benefits are increased usability, safety and efficiency.  Unfortunately, designing and implementing new languages is difficult and time consuming. Thus, reuse of language infrastructure is an attractive implementation avenue.  The central question then becomes, what is the best method to extend languages?  Much research has focussed on methods of extension based on using features of the language itself such as macros or reflection.  This dissertation focuses on a complementary solution: plug-in compilers. In this approach languages are extended at run-time via dynamic extensions to compilers, called plug-ins.  Plug-ins can be used to extend the expressiveness, safety and efficiency of languages. However, a plug-in compiler provides other benefits. Plug-in compilers encourage modularity, lower the barrier of entry to development, and facilitate the distribution and use of experimental language extensions. This dissertation describes how plug-in support is added, to both the front and back-end of a compiler, and demonstrates their application through a pair of case studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plug-ins</field><field name="subject">functional programming</field><field name="subject">extensibility</field><field name="subject">dynamic loading</field><field name="subject">expression problem</field><field name="subject">meta-programming</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of factors influencing the functional efficiency of concrete slabs</field><field name="creator">Wang, Xiaobo, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Flatness, levelness and plastic shrinkage cracks are three important parameters in the evaluation of the performance of concrete floor surfaces. The rapidly developing concrete floor industry overseas has resulted in a great deal of improvement in the methods for evaluation of surface flatness and levelness. This research encompasses a review of the development and evolution of codes in other countries, an evaluation of the current status in Australia, and reliable evaluation methods for concrete floors. The end result aims to present a comparison of the varying degrees of reliability of the different methods of measurement theoretically and demonstrates the feasibility of specified tolerance through the analysis of field data from actual projects. It also analyses the general assumption that concrete slabs exposed to hot weather conditions soon after casting is prone to plastic shrinkage cracking and its implications. Identifying factors influencing flatness, levelness and plastic shrinkage cracking of concrete slab surface and investigation of their effects are included in this research. Through statistical analysis, significant factors, such as the construction method, environmental conditions and the method of measurement are identified. In addition, sunlight intensity and capacity of concrete bleeding were factors investigated with regard to concrete surface evaporation rate. The monitoring of plastic shrinkage crack initiation and development is an important task in the research of concrete slabs. The research on plastic shrinkage cracking of the slab surface resulted in the development of a digital image analysis method. This method focuses on mapping cracks (MC) and measuring crack width (MCW). Other information such as crack growth over time can also be obtained based on MC and MCW. An accurate method for the measurement of crack width has been developed based on sliced crack image data. Therefore, this method can determine the location of the maximum crack width and measure it with a desired precision.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'To see a world in a grain of sand...': thinking universality and specificity for a feminist politics of difference</field><field name="creator">Hinton, Peta, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sexual difference has emerged in the last three decades as an enduring question for feminism.  Drawing attention to the embodied nature of subjectivity, it enables feminists to counter the more insidious presumptions of universality and the phallocentric economy of knowledge production, and makes possible feminine expressions of subjectivity.  At the same time, engaging the nature of difference has opened the way to a more detailed interrogation of identity, specifically the identity of ' woman' and 'the feminine' as categories of feminist analysis.  However, tensions have emerged within this field over the concept of community, and how to motivate for political change on the basis of a common identity when the identity of woman is itself contested.   In tracing these arguments, this thesis raises a number of considerations about the way difference is understood.  It finds that a conceptual commitment to the specificity of the body as properly constitutive of the political can run the risk of sidelining, denigrating and presuming to excise what appears as universal, masculine, or phallocentric.  In doing so, it potentially leaves aside a full political engagement with the generative and implicated nature of these terms in the formation of all identity.  Consequently, questions around thought, universality, virtuality, and disembodiment may not be given full consideration, with the outcome that feminism may be foreclosing its political domain from important formative concerns.  The primary aim of this thesis is to open these categories of analysis to question, to understand how they have been constructed in debates around difference, and to bring to light some of the assumptions which remain axiological to what properly constitutes feminist politics.  Engaging Luce Irigaray's reading of divinity for community and identity, this thesis argues that if the implicated nature of identity is taken seriously then the organising categories fundamental to notions of political action and community become a general field of difference which exceeds the reach of feminist politics as it currently stands.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sex differences -- Political aspects.</field><field name="subject">Feminism -- Political aspects.</field><field name="subject">Feminist theory.</field><field name="subject">Corporeality.</field><field name="subject">Politics of location.</field><field name="subject">Cyberfeminism.</field><field name="subject">Disembodiment.</field><field name="subject">Virtuality.</field><field name="subject">Mind.</field><field name="subject">Thought.</field><field name="subject">Dualism.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40773</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intelligent scheduling and control of automated guided vehicle considering machine loading in a flexible manufacturing system: using hopfield networks and simulation.</field><field name="creator">Kim, Doosuk, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) have received increasing attention from researchers and practitioners due to their potential advantages: quicker response to market changes, reduction in work-in-process (WIP), high inventory turnover and high levels of productivity. Two groups of problems in an FMS are of importance: (1) design problems and (2) operational problems. Operational problems can be effectively separated into 4 sub-problems: planning, grouping, machine loading problem (MLP) and scheduling. Problems from machine loading to scheduling and control of an FMS can be handled with neural networks approaches and simulation. The machine loading problem as a combinatorial optimization problem is actually a classic problem in operations research and is known to be NP-hard. MLP formulated as 0-1 integer programming problems has been solved by the methods of linearizing the nonlinear terms, branch and bound algorithm, and heuristic methods which have also been popularly applied. Hopfield Networks as a class of artificial neural networks have been adapted as an efficient method to solve the MLP, as these are able to find the solutions quickly through massive and parallel computation. Unfortunately, the quality of the solutions can occasionally be poor owing to the values of the weighting parameters in the energy function of the Hopfield Networks. One alternative approach used is to imbed mean field annealing into Hopfield Networks. The hybrid method of Hopfield Networks and mean field annealing can find near-optimal solutions as well as overcome the difficulties with decisions about the weighting of parameters in the energy function. The AGV scheduling problem can be regarded as the problem of selecting appropriate dispatch rules. Many dispatch rules have been introduced by a number of researchers. Even though vqarious formulations of the FMS scheduling problem can be presented, simulation methods are popular and often used. A solution methodology for MLP and AGV scheduling problems is proposed and specific models based on the literature are subjected to experimented through simulation. The proposed methodology can be also applied without difficulty to of breakdowns of machines and AGV. Results from simulation experiment s show that superior performance and capability of the proposed to existing methods are demonstrated by applying them to the test problems represented by simulation..</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic  record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The programming language TransLucid</field><field name="creator">Ditu, Gabriel Cristian, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents TransLucid, a low-level, purely declarative, intensional programming language. Built on a simple algebra and with just a small number of primitives, TransLucid programs define arbitrary dimensional infinite data structures, which are then queried to produce results. The formal foundations of TransLucid come from the work in intensional logic by Montague and Scott.  The background chapters give a history of intensional logic and its predecessors in the Western world, as well as a history of intensional programming and Lucid, the first intensional programming language.  The semantics of TransLucid are fully specified in the form of operational semantics. Three levels of semantics are given, in increasing order of efficiency, with the sequential warehouse semantics, the most efficient, being presented together with a proof that any expression will be evaluated by only examining relevant dimensions in the current context. The language is then extended in three important ways, by adding versioned identifiers, (declarative) side-effects and timestamped equations and demands.  Adding versioned identifiers to TransLucid enriches the expressiveness of the language and allows the encoding of a variety of programming paradigms, ranging from manipulating large data-cubes to pattern-matching.  Adding side-effects supports one of the main reasons for TransLucid: namely, to provide a target language, together with a methodology, for translating the main programming paradigms, thus creating a uniform end platform that can be the focus for optimisation and program verification. A translation of imperative programs into TransLucid is given.  Timestamped equations and demands enable TransLucid to become a language for synchronous programming in real-time systems, as well as allowing runtime updates to a program's equations.  The language TransLucid represents a decisive advance in declarative programming. It has applications in many fields of computer science and opens up exciting new avenues of research.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TransLucid.</field><field name="subject">Lucid (Computer program language)</field><field name="subject">Intensional programming.</field><field name="subject">Cartesian programming.</field><field name="subject">Declarative programming.</field><field name="subject">Programming language semantics.</field><field name="subject">Programming language translation.</field><field name="subject">Modal logic.</field><field name="subject">Intensional logic.</field><field name="subject">Modality (Logic)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Liver-directed gene therapy for type 1 diabetes</field><field name="creator">Appavoo, Mathiyalagan, Prince of Wales Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Genetically engineered insulin-producing cells, surrogate ?? cells, offer a solution to the shortage of ?? cells available for transplantation in individuals with Type 1 diabetes. Hepatocytes are a promising starting cell in the quest for surrogate ?? cells. However, achieving glucose-regulated insulin secretion in the genetically engineered liver cells is a difficult task as liver cells do not possess regulated secretory pathway. NeuroD, a pancreatic ?? cell transcription factor is involved in the differentiation of endocrine pancreatic cells and also directly regulates the expression of genes in the differentiated cells. However, little is known about the role of NeuroD in the glucose-regulated insulin secretion. The aim of this study was to investigate whether NeuroD induces glucose-regulated insulin secretion in the insulin-producing rat liver cell line, FAO-ins. The human NeuroD gene was stably expressed in FAO-ins cells. In the transfected cells (FAOins-Nd) the expression of genes encoding transcription factor Foxa2, L-type calcium channel subunits and secretory granule protein CgA was up-regulated. FAOins-Nd also showed greater intracellular insulin content and secretion as well as released insulin in a regulated manner to calcium stimulus. Further, growth factors namely betacellulin, activin A, nicotinamide and exendin-4 as well as insulin secretagogues such as theophylline, IBMX and carbachol were examined by static incubation in inducing glucose-regulated insulin secretion. Exendin-4 and insulin secretagogues stimulate insulin secretion in the presence of 1.5 mM glucose but the addition of 20 mM glucose had no further stimulatory effect. These results indicate that FAOins-Nd cells are sensitive to glucose and the release of insulin is non-glucose dependent. Overexpression of NeuroD and further treatment with exendin-4 or insulin secretagogues up-regulated insulin secretion but did not render these cells glucose-responsive. An attempt was made to generate transgenic NOD mice expressing large amounts of insulin in the liver using PEPCK promoter with SV40 poly adenylation sequence. Transgenic NOD mice were generated and the presence of insulin transgene was demonstrated. However, insulin mRNA and protein were not expressed in the liver of transgenic mice.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30189</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional calculus and coadjoint orbits.</field><field name="creator">Raffoul, Raed Wissam, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Let G be a compact Lie group and let &#960; be an irreducible representation of G of highest weight &#955;.

This increased availability of water has caused many ecological impacts. Unfortunately, such impacts are poorly understood in the context of an Australian conservation reserve, thus hindering strategic management. This study examined the spatial distribution of vertebrate (kangaroos, small mammals, lizards and avifauna) and vegetative variables around open AWPs as well as AWPs that have been closed since pastoralism (sheep-grazing) ceased nearly thirty years ago in Sturt National Park, arid New South Wales. The study also examined vertebrate use of AWPs, with a particular emphasis on kangaroos and avifauna. The study revealed that most variables showed few differences in spatial distribution with distance from open and closed AWPs, thus suggesting that the observed piospheric impacts were primarily attributable to historical sheep-grazing. Indeed, piospheric patterns were weak suggesting some recovery over the last thirty years. That kangaroos did not exhibit water-focused grazing is no surprise, since despite their regular use of AWPs, particularly during hot, dry times, the current spatial arrangement of AWPs facilitates regular travel to, and from, such resources allowing kangaroos, like much other fauna, to distribute themselves in relation to food and shelter preferences rather than in relation to water supply. In contrast, the majority of avifaunal groups (excluding ground-dwelling species) were clustered around open AWPs, often irrespective of season, because of food and water requirements. Such spatial concentrations of avifauna are thought to cause a range of interspecific effects. Experimental AWP closure and GIS modelling showed that whilst closure of AWPs will increase the average distance to water, which will have key benefits, the majority of areas in Sturt National Park would still be accessible to most water-dependent species even if all unused AWPs were closed. Strategic retention of AWPs to replace water sources lost since European settlement, aid threatened and migratory species??? conservation and enhance nature-based tourism opportunities is thus recommended and an example of a strategic management and monitoring plan outlined.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biodiversity</field><field name="subject">watering points</field><field name="subject">piosphere</field><field name="subject">rangeland conservation</field><field name="subject">arid zone</field><field name="subject">kangaroos</field><field name="subject">avifauna</field><field name="subject">small mammals</field><field name="subject">reptiles</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30122</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of the basolateral amygdala in learning and  relearning context conditioned fear and its extinction.</field><field name="creator">Laurent, Vincent, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) is a key component of the neuronal circuitry underlying the acquisition and the extinction of Pavlovian conditioned fear. The present series of experiments examined the role of neuronal activity and NMDA receptors (NMDAr) activation in the BLA on learning and relearning context conditioned fear and its extinction. Disruption of neuronal activity in the BLA prevented the acquisition of fear responses to a novel, a moderately familiar or a highly familiar context. It also prevented the reacquisition of fear responses to a conditioned or an extinguished context. Local blockade of NMDAr containing the NR2B subunit prior to training extinction or re-extinction impaired the short- and long-term loss of fear responses. In contrast, a similar blockade subsequent to training extinction or re-extinction left the long-term loss of fear responses unaffected. Disruption of neuronal activity in the BLA prior to training extinction and re-extinction depressed fear responses. It impaired the long-term loss of fear produced by extinction training but spared and even facilitated the long-loss of fear produced by re-extinction training when extinction had already been learned. The exact same outcome was observed when neuronal activity in the BLA was disrupted subsequent to training extinction and re-extinction. These findings suggest that the BLA is critical for both learning and relearning context conditioned fear. In contrast, the BLA is necessary for learning but not relearning extinction of conditioned fear. This implies that once extinction has been learned, others structures support the retrieval and the expression of extinction memory. This is consistent with current neural model of extinction that involves interactions between several neural substrates including the BLA and the medial prefrontal cortex.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fear conditioning.</field><field name="subject">Extinction.</field><field name="subject">Learning.</field><field name="subject">Relearning.</field><field name="subject">Amygdaloid body.</field><field name="subject">Conditioned response.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40769</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reachable sets analysis in the cooperative control of pursuer vehicles.</field><field name="creator">Chung, Chern Ferng, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the Pursuit-and-Evasion (PE) problem where the pursuer aims to minimize the time to capture the evader while the evader tries to prevent capture. In the problem, the evader has two advantages: a higher manoeuvrability and that the pursuer is uncertain about the evader??s state. Cooperation among multiple pursuer vehicles can thus be used to overcome the evader??s advantages. The focus here is on the formulation and development of frameworks and algorithms for cooperation amongst pursuers, aiming at feasible implementation on real and autonomous vehicles. The thesis is split into Parts I and II. Part I considers the problem of capturing an evader of higher manoeuvrability in a deterministic PE game. The approach is the employment of Forward Reachable Set (FRS) analysis in the pursuers?? control. The analysis considers the coverage of the evader??s FRS, which is the set of reachable states at a future time, with the pursuer??s FRS and assumes that the chance of capturing the evader is dependent on the degree of the coverage. Using the union of multiple pursuers?? FRSs intuitively leads to more evader FRS coverage and this forms the mechanism of cooperation. A framework for cooperative control based on the FRS coverage, or FRS-based control, is proposed. Two control algorithms were developed within this framework. Part II additionally introduces the problem of evader state uncertainty due to noise and limited field-of-view of the pursuers?? sensors. A search-and-capture (SAC) problem is the result and a hybrid architecture, which includes multi-sensor estimation using the Particle Filter as well as FRS-based control, is proposed to accomplish the SAC task. The two control algorithms in Part I were tested in simulations against an optimal guidance algorithm. The results show that both algorithms yield a better performance in terms of time and miss distance. The results in Part II demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid architecture for the SAC task. The proposed frameworks and  algorithms provide insights for the development of effective and more efficient control of pursuer vehicles and can be useful in the practical applications such as defence systems and civil law enforcement.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pursuit-evasion</field><field name="subject">Cooperative control</field><field name="subject">Forward reachable set</field><field name="subject">Particle filter</field><field name="subject">Autonomous search</field><field name="subject">Recursive Bayesian estimation</field><field name="subject">Differential games.</field><field name="subject">Control theory.</field><field name="subject">Algorithms.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Superreplication method for multi-asset barrier options.</field><field name="creator">Dharmawan, Komang, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to study multi-asset barrier options, where the volatilities of the stocks are assumed to define a matrix-valued bounded stochastic process.  The bounds on volatilities may represent, for instance, the extreme values of the volatilities of traded options. As the volatilities are not known exactly, the value of the option can not be determined. Nevertheless, it is possible to calculate extreme values. We show that these values correspond to the best and the worst case scenarios of the future volatilities for short positions and long positions in the portfolio of the options. Our main tool is the equivalence of the option pricing and a certain stochastic control problem and the resulting concept of superhedging. This concept has been well known for some time but never applied to barrier options. First, we prove the dynamic programming principle (DPP) for the control problem. Next, using rather standard arguments we derive the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for the value function. We show that the value function is a unique viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Then we define the super price and superhedging strategy for the barrier options and show equivalence with the control problem studied above. The superprice price can be found by solving the nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Equation studied above. It is called sometimes the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt (BSB) equation. This is the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation of the exit control problem. The sup term in the BSB equation is determined dynamically: it is either the upper bound or the lower bound of the volatility matrix,  according to the convexity or concavity   of the value function with respect to the stock prices. By utilizing a probabilistic approach,  we show that the value function of the exit control problem is continuous. Then, we also obtain bounds for the first derivative of the value function with respect to the space variable. This derivative has an important financial interpretation. Namely, it allows us to define the superhedging strategy. We include an example: pricing and hedging of a single-asset barrier option and its numerical solution using the finite difference method.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Options (Finance)--Prices--Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Options (Finance)--Valuation--Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Investment analysis--Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30169</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genetics of variation in gene expression</field><field name="creator">Cotsapas, Chris, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The majority of genetic differences between species and individuals have been hypothesised to impact on the regulation, rather than the structure, of genes. As the details of genetic variation are uncovered by the various genome sequencing projects, understanding the functional effects on gene regulation will be key to uncovering the molecular mechanisms underying the genesis and inheritance of common phenotypes, such as complex human disease and commercially important traits in plants and animals. Unlike coding sequence polymorphisms, genetic variants affecting gene expression will reside in the transcriptional machinery and its regulatory inputs. As these are largely specific to cell- or tissue-types, we would expect that regulatory variants will also affect final mRNA levels in a tissue specific manner. Genetic variation between individuals may therefore be more complex than the sum total of sequence differences between them. Demonstrating this hypothesis is the main focus of this thesis. We use microarrays to measure mRNA levels of approximately 22,000 transcripts in inbred and recombinant inbred strains of mice, and present compelling evidence that the genetic influences on these levels are tissue-specific in at least 85% of cases. We uncover two loci which apparently influence transcript levels of multiple genes in a tissue-specific manner. We also present evidence that failure of microarray data normalisation may cause spurious linkage of expression phenotypes leading to erroneous biological conclusions, and detail a novel, extensible mathematical framework for performing tailored normalisation which can remove such systematic bias.

Attempts to measure dityrosine concentrations in various physiological and pathological systems have produced varied and often contradictory results.  Dityrosine concentrations in urine, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue varying over three orders of magnitude have been reported, together with inconsistent claims of significant dityrosine elevation in several ageing-related pathologies.  Some of these findings have contributed to the implication of free radical activity in the pathology of several neurodegenerative disorders, vascular and ocular abnormalities and in phagocyte response to infection.  The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that dityrosine levels are elevated in ageing and ageing-related disease.  The study also aims to determine the utility of dityrosine measurement as an index of oxidative damage, and elucidate possible explanations for the inconsistent levels reported.  An assay for the quantification of dityrosine was developed using capillary HPLC with electrospray tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS).  The assay was highly specific for dityrosine and has the highest absolute sensitivity for dityrosine of any method reported to date, with a detection limit of 3 femtomoles of dityrosine on-column.  Urine samples from volunteers of different age and from hospital patients with various pathologies were analysed.  Plasma protein hydrolysates from control, Alzheimer???s and stroke subjects were analysed, together with hydrolysates of post mortem brain tissue from Alzheimer???s and control subjects.  Urinary dityrosine level is elevated in states of acute infection and inflammation, but does not correlate with age or chronic disease.  Protein dityrosine in four sections of Alzheimer???s brain was not significantly different from control sections.  Dityrosine was present in human plasma and tissue proteins at approximately 5-35 residues per million tyrosine residues, and in normal urine at 5-25 micromol/mol creatinine or 20-200 nM.  Most of the discrepancies in the literature relate to inadequate specificity of the analytical method.  Interpretation of published data with critical appraisal of measurement technology specificity is essential in developing an accurate understanding of the role of free radicals in ageing and disease.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tyrosine--Measurement</field><field name="subject">Free radicals (Chemistry)--Analysis</field><field name="subject">Active oxygen--Physiological effect.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of hybrid securities to raise capital in Australian listed markets</field><field name="creator">Suchard, Jo-Ann Clair, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Studies on the use of hybrid securities by listed firms to raise capital in international markets have been limited. The existing evidence on the seasoned capital raising process has concentrated on straight equity and debt issues in the United States (US) market. The Australian market provides a unique comparative capital raising environment as it has a number of operating and structural features that are different to many other markets. These differences include the method of issuing securities (rights issues), underwriting contracts (standby contracts), the trading volume of securities (thin trading), the industry makeup of listed firms (a high number of resource firms) and characteristics of capital raising instruments (convertible debt is non callable and is the only type of listed debt instrument, options are used as stand alone instruments to raise capital). This research focuses on how these differences give rise to differences in the share price reaction to security issues, the relevant explanations of the share price reaction, the security choice decision and the demand for underwriter services in the Australian market, compared to other markets. The impact of the announcement of hybrid security issues is examined using event study methodology adjusted for thin trading (as per Maynes and Rumsey(1993). Australian markets have differing characteristics to international markets including differing issue and issuer characteristics of hybrid security issues. However, the announcement effect evidence for Australian hybrid issues is consistent with international evidence for convertible debt issues but is inconsistent for company issued options and preference shares. Announcements of convertible debt are met with a significant negative share market response, a positive pre announcement runup and negative post announcement dnft, similar to US and UK issues. Although the announcement of an option issue can be viewed as an issue of delayed equity, option issues are met with a significant positive share price response rather than the negative share price response found for international equity issues. Announcements of preference share issues are met with an insignificant positive share price response which is in contrast to US and UK results. The results of the analysis of the explanation of the announcement effect of issuing new hybrid securities in the Australian market, suggest that different variables are significant explanators for the Australian market compared to international markets. The results of the models developed for the explanations of the announcement effect of Australian hybrid issues differ across security type. In general, the results for Australian issues of hybrid securities provide the greatest support for variants of the information asymmetry hypothesis. Convertible debt issues are best explained by the general information asymmetry hypothesis and the information asymmetry : external monitoring hypothesis. Option issues are best explained by information asymmetry : rights issues information asymmetry : signalling and agency cost hypotheses. Preference share issues are best explained by information asymmetry : rights issues, information asymmetry : external monitoring and the information asymmetry : signalling hypothesis. The security choice decision between hybrid securities is examined using logit regression analysis. When the choice is restricted to options and convertible debt, firms with high financial risk (leverage) and firm nsk (share volatility) are more likely to issue equity or in this study, equity like securities (options) and firms with higher pre announcement returns and larger issue size are more likely to issue debt or debt like securities (convertible debt). When the choice is extended to include preference shares, firms with high firm risk are more likely to choose options and firms making a relatively large issue are less likely to choose options (when financial risk is measured as long term debt over total assets) or more likely to choose convertible debt (when financial risk is measured as long term debt over equity). The determinants of underwriter use are examined using logit regression analysis for option issues as they are the only type of hybrid instruments that are not mostly underwritten. The results for the demand for underwriter services show that issue size, trading frequency and market risk are the determinants of the use of underwriters for Australian option issuers. This implies that mangers are more likely to choose to use an underwriter, the higher the amount of capital to be raised, the higher the trading frequency of the shares and the lower the market risk. The results are similar to partial results found for New Zealand and Norwegian equity issues where subscription price discount, issue size, firm risk, trading frequency, shareholder concentration and shareholder precommitments are determinants of underwriter use.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporations -- Australia -- Finance; Convertible securities.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of exogenous growth factors; platelet derived growth factor, insulin-like growth factor binding protein and fibroblast growth factor, and their influence on in vivo bone repair.</field><field name="creator">Martin, Christopher, School of Biomedical Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research investigated if exogenous growth factors (GFs), in particular platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), has an in vivo effect on the healing response of normal healthy bone. The research was orientated to study whether a clinical beneficial effect could be demonstrated. To achieve this two animal models were utilised, namely, a rabbit tibial osteotomy model and an ovine tibial defect and porous implant ingrowth model. The rabbit model comprised of a unilateral V-shaped tibial osteotomy, stabilised with an absorbable intramedullary pin and figure-of-eight tension band suture, with a 3 week survival period. The GFs tested in this model were 3 concentrations of PDGF, a single dose of insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGF-BP) and a combination of the two. Each osteotomy was injected with a single bolus of collagen (control) or collagen containing GF (treatment) during surgery. After sacrifice tibiae were CT-scanned in situ, harvested and subject to 4-point bend testing. The callus, underlying bone and contralateral bone's greyscales and mechanical testing results were used for comparative analysis. The ovine model consisted of implanting 6 small rectangular shaped titanium alloy porous implants and one empty defect bilaterally in sheep's tibiae, for 4 and 6 weeks. The sheep were injected with tetracycline bone marker at 2 week intervals. The model's characteristics and any positional effects were initially investigated. Followed by an investigation into the influence of various exogenous GFs on the healing response and ingrowth characteristics of bone into the porous implants. The GFs investigated were PDGF, IGF-BP and fibroblast growth factor impregnated into the porous implants in a collagen carrier. Comparative analysis was done on results from 3-point bend testing of the bone/implant interface, image analysis to quantify percentage of bone, from scanning electron microscopy images of implant sections and confocal microscopy images of tibial defect sections. Analyses indicate that the GFs investigated have a direct and quantifiable positive in vivo effect. The more significant finding is that the growth factors have a potent systemic effect. These results were confirmed by both the sheep porous bone plug model and the rabbit tibial osteotomy model used within this research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibiliographic record is available in LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary consequences of growth-from plasticity in a red seaweed.</field><field name="creator">Monro, Keyne, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Evolutionary processes in any population depend upon patterns of phenotypic variation available to selection and their underlying heritability. In this thesis, I used the filamentous red seaweed Asparagopsis armata, with particular focus on its modularity, to test several key questions underlying its growth-form evolution in  heterogeneous environments. I established that experimental manipulations of light quantity and quality mimicking variation in underwater light due to shading or depth induce growthform plasticity in A. armata that may be evolutionarily significant given its variability among clones. Current patterns of plasticity displayed by A. armata appear adaptive, moreover, given that a reciprocal transplant of phenotypes between light environments found densely-branched (phalanx-like) phenotypes to have higher relative growth rates than sparsely-branched (guerrilla-like) phenotypes in well-lit patches, but lower relative growth rates than the latter in shaded patches. Using the capacity for rapid growth as a proxy for fitness, multivariate selection analyses identified environment-dependent patterns of directional selection on single traits coupled with linear and nonlinear selection on multi-trait combinations that shape growth-form variation within patches of differing light intensity, thereby reinforcing plasticity across light environments. Quantitative genetic analyses, however, suggest that the modular iteration of genes in morphogenesis may limit further growth-form evolution in A. armata populations exposed to spatial heterogeneity in light by constraining thallus responses to environment-dependent selection. Last, heritable responses to artificial selection on growth-form variation among clonal cell-lineages revealed the surprising capacity for A.armata to circumvent genetic constraints inherent to its development by adapting to environmental change in the absence of sexually-generated variance among clones.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phenotypic plasticity.</field><field name="subject">Red algae.</field><field name="subject">Evolution (Biology)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40590</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New developments in the construction of lattice rules: applications of lattice rules to high-dimensional integration problems from mathematical finance.</field><field name="creator">Waterhouse, Benjamin James, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">There are many problems in mathematical finance which require the evaluation of a multivariate integral. Since these problems typically involve the discretisation of a continuous random variable, the dimension of the integrand can be in the thousands, tens of thousands or even more.  For such problems the Monte Carlo method has been a powerful and popular technique. This is largely related to the fact that the performance of the method is independent of the number of dimensions. Traditional quasi-Monte Carlo techniques are typically not independent of the dimension and as such have not been suitable for high-dimensional problems. However, recent work has developed new types of quasi-Monte Carlo point sets which can be used in practically limitless dimension. Among these types of point sets are Sobol' sequences, Faure sequences, Niederreiter-Xing sequences, digital nets and lattice rules. In this thesis, we will concentrate on results concerning lattice rules. The typical setting for analysis of these new quasi-Monte Carlo point sets is the worst-case error in a weighted function space. There has been much work on constructing point sets with small worst-case errors in the weighted Korobov and Sobolev spaces. However, many of the integrands which arise in the area of mathematical finance do not lie in either of these spaces. One common problem is that the integrands are unbounded on the boundaries of the unit cube. In this thesis we construct function spaces which admit such integrands and present algorithms to construct lattice rules where the worst-case error in this new function space is small.  Lattice rules differ from other quasi-Monte Carlo techniques in that the points can not be used sequentially. That is, the entire lattice is needed to keep the worst-case error small. It has been shown that there exist generating vectors for lattice rules which are good for many different numbers of points. This is a desirable property for a practitioner, as it allows them to keep increasing the number of points until some error criterion is met. In this thesis, we will develop fast algorithms to construct such generating vectors. Finally, we apply a similar technique to show how a particular type of generating vector known as the Korobov form can be made extensible in dimension.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lattice theory.</field><field name="subject">Monte Carlo method.</field><field name="subject">Multiple integrals.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical and experimental studies of granular dynamics in IsaMill</field><field name="creator">Jayasundara, Chandana Tilak, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">IsaMill is a stirred type mill used in mineral industry for fine and ultra-fine grinding. The difficulty in obtaining the internal flow information in the mill by experimental techniques has prevented the development of the fundamental understanding of the flow and generating general methods for reliable scale-up and optimized design and control parameters. This difficulty can be effectively overcome by numerical simulation based on discrete element method (DEM). In this work a DEM model was developed to study particle flow in a simplified IsaMill. The DEM model was validated by comparing the simulated results of the flow pattern, mixing pattern and power draw with those measured from a same scale lab mill. Spatial distributions of microdynamic variables related to flow and force structure such as local porosity, particle interaction forces, collision velocity and collision frequency have been analyzed. Among the materials properties of particles, it is shown that by decreasing particle/particle sliding friction coefficient, the particle flow becomes more vigorous which is useful to grinding performance. Restitution coefficient does not affect the particle flow significantly. A too low or too high particle density could decrease grinding efficiency. Although grinding medium size affects the flow, its selection may depend on the particle size of the products. Among the operational variables considered, the results show that fill volume and mill speed proved to be important factors in IsaMil process. Increase of fill volume or mill speed increases the interaction between particles and agitating discs which results in a more vigorous motion of the particles. Among the mill properties, particle/stirrer sliding friction plays a major role in energy transfer from stirrer to particles. Although there exists a minimum collision energy as particle/stirrer sliding friction increases, large particle/stirrer sliding friction may improve grinding performance as it has both large collision frequency and collision energy. However, that improvement is only up to a critical particle/disc sliding friction beyond which only input energy increases with little improvement on collision frequency and collision energy. Reducing the distance between stirrers or increasing the size of disc holes improves high energy transfer from discs to particles, leading to high collision frequency and collision energy. Among the different stirrer types, the energy transfer is more effective when disc holes are present. Pin stirrer shows increased collision energy and collision frequency which also result in a high power draw. Using the DEM results, a wear model has been developed to predict the wear pattern of the discs. This model can be used to predict the evolution of the disc wear with the time. It is shown that energy transfer from discs to particles are increased when discs are worn out. An attempt has also been made to analyze the microdynamic properties of the mill for different sizes. It is shown that specific power consumption and impact energy are correlated regardless of the mill size and mill speed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DEM.</field><field name="subject">IsaMill.</field><field name="subject">Fine grinding.</field><field name="subject">Milling machinery.</field><field name="subject">Grinding machines.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the effects of hydrostatic pressureon rat retinal ganglion cell line RGC5.</field><field name="creator">Li, Shaojuan, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Glaucoma is characterized by retinal ganglion cell apoptosis leading to a corresponding loss of the visual field. Elevated intraocular pressure is the principal clinical association of this disease and its reduction remains the mainstay of current therapy. This research established an in-vitro glaucoma model and investigated the direct effects of increased hydrostatic pressure on retinal ganglion cell survival as well as the cellular response to changes in pressure. In the first part of this thesis (chapter 3) the direct effects of pressure on retinal ganglion cell survival was established. The differentiated RGC5 cell line was subjected to elevated pressure 100 mmHg for a period of two hours in a pressure chamber. Cell apoptosis was then detected by TdT-mediated dITP Nick-End Labelling (TUNEL). Quantitative analysis of the percentage of apoptotic cells between the control and pressure groups by Laser Scanning Cytometry (LSC) revealed that pressure alone induced significant apoptosis. Furthermore, caspase-3 cleavage was detected in the pressure treated cells by Western blot analysis. The next three chapters investigated how the applied pressure may be mediated through cellular mechno-sensitive structures. TWIK Related Arachiodonic Acid stimulated K+ channel (TRAAK) is a mechano-gated neuronal potassium channel, which can be opened by pressure and arachidonic acid. In chapter 4, TRAAK was identified as expressed on the rat RGC5 cell line. This was determined by both immunostaining and RT-PCR. Opening this channel by arachidonic acid induced significant apoptosis in RGC5 neurons; elevated extracellular K+ concentration and blockage of TRAAK by gadolinium inhibited both arachidonic acid and pressure-induced apoptosis. These results indicated that elevated pressure resulted in opening of the outward potassium channel-TRAAK and consequently potassium ion efflux and apoptotic volume decrease (AVD). Data from chapter 5      revealed that pressure also caused actin     reorganization with both F- and G-actin shifts. At the early stage (following 2 hours pressure treatment), actin polymerization led to G-actin pool decrease and disinhibition of DNase1 in the cytoplasm. This has been suggested to lead to DNase1 nuclear translocation and contribution to DNA fragmentation associated with apoptosis. The preliminary microarray results of chapter 6 revealed pressure effects on gene expression Included in the many up- and down-regulated genes was; down-regulation of antiapoptotic gene- BcL-x and up- regulation of Damage-Induced Neuronal Endopeptidase (DINE) after pressure treatment. This study showed that elevated pressure induced RGC5 apoptosis and affected multi cellular mechanosnesitive structures. These results may indicate new mechanisms of RGC neuron apoptosis and further therapeutic strategies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrostatic pressure</field><field name="subject">Retinal ganglion cells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internationalization as an entrepreneurial process.</field><field name="creator">Chandra, Yanto, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite the substantial amount of work undertaken on internationalization to-date, most has placed little emphasis on the temporal processes and dynamics of internationalization in shaping firm internationalization histories. This is reflected in several problem areas in theories and research regarding internationalization including accelerated internationalization, full and partial de-internationalization and use of multiple modes of entry at a point in time. This study addressed an important question: what factors and processes affect the way a firm???s pattern of internationalization changes over time?  Although mainstream theories of internationalization and recent advances that link internationalization and entrepreneurship assume the importance of ???opportunity???, there is a paucity of research that that places ???opportunity??? as the core process in internationalization. By embracing time as a key dimension, this study reconceptualized internationalization as an entrepreneurial process: as the process of opportunity discovery, evaluation and exploitation in international markets. The research was undertaken in two phases. Phase 1 included a literature review covering the internationalization and entrepreneurship research streams. The discovery-evaluation-exploitation framework from entrepreneurship was used to identify relevant factors and explore eight case studies. By drawing on results from the exploratory research, an initial conceptual model and a set of propositions were developed. In Phase 2, fifteen case studies were theoretically sampled from a pool of small and medium enterprises from the knowledge and non-knowledge based industries in Australia. The data collection and analysis followed a process, event-driven approach to case study research involving the mapping of key sequences of events as well as within and cross case analysis.  The results clarified the nature and pattern of opportunity discovery, evaluation and exploitation, and a number of factors that influence this process: the role of prior knowledge, network ties, serendipity, absorptive capacity, bricolage, the nature of uncertainty, feedback mechanisms and effectual versus causal reasoning. The findings also suggest the evolutionary process of firm development and internationalization and show that born globals may be a classification error. The results indicate that full and partial de-internationalization as well as the use of multiple modes of entry are influenced by the interconnectedness of opportunities across the founding, domestic and international context over time; the role of Knightian uncertainty which can push or pull the patterns in many directions and how firms rely on effectual reasoning. The results provide a better understanding of the basic mechanisms of internationalization. The academic contributions of this thesis include the extension of Jones and Coviello???s (2005) model and previous models by developing a dynamic, process model of internationalization that is capable of addressing the temporal and dynamic gaps in internationalization; the integration and reconciliation of extant theories of internationalization by understanding the role of mode of reasoning; and the establishment of ???opportunity-firm??? nexus as a suitable unit of analysis in internationalization and international entrepreneurship research. Finally, the managerial contributions include guidance for firms and entrepreneurs in terms of dealing with uncertainty and complexity in international markets using the appropriate mode of reasoning (i.e. effectual, non-predictive approach vs. causal, predictive approach) in the right context and circumstances.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internationalization.</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship.</field><field name="subject">Globalization -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship -- Australia -- Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of Russian piano pedagogy on Vietnamese pianists, with comparisons of effects of Vietnamese piano pedagogy and UK piano pedagogy.</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Minh Thanh, School of English, Media &amp; Performing Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cultures in contact over a considerable period influence intellectual traditions, practices and habits relating to musical expression and the manner of teaching it. This study investigates the effects of different cultural contacts on Vietnamese student pianists, especially from Russian-style piano pedagogy and associated educational ideas and methods in music conservatoires. The purpose of this study was to compare various teaching approaches and learning styles, and the reactions of Vietnamese students to three different sources of training of piano teachers: Russia, Vietnam and England. Different sources of training affected piano pedagogy, and different musical traditions affected expression in piano performance, especially where students are from a cultural background different from that of their teacher. Observations of actual piano lessons were undertaken, and data were also obtained from interviews and questionnaires and analysed statistically. Results are reported and discussed in relation to four prominent features of the Russian piano school: achieving a powerful and substantial sound; the requirement for ???singing??? quality on the piano; the solid technical training which requires an enormous amount of practice time; and the necessity to play from memory. These are four prominent features of the Russian piano schooling. In addition, Vietnamese students??? problems regarding rhythmic accuracy highlight an inherent difference between the Vietnamese and Russian piano school. Major differences and similarities in teaching styles between Russian teachers and those from the UK and Vietnam were described and commented on under the following headings: use of mental practice; the role of listening; teacher demonstration; freedom for students in learning and making decisions (choice of repertoire; performance opportunities for students; students??? emotional reactions); the more liberal approach of the UK teachers; and the piano teaching styles at the Hanoi Conservatory that have been strongly influenced by the Russian piano school through Russian graduates??? teaching in Vietnam. These findings have important pedagogical implications. The more teachers control there was in lessons, the less a student would contribute to lessons actively. More liberal or less authoritarian approaches to teaching do not necessarily inculcate the discipline required for high achievement technically and expressively. There needs to be a balance between liberal approaches and encouraging the student to become autonomous in their efforts, and ensuring that they realize the importance of being disciplined in their practice habits.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Superficial fusion of rice kernels at high temperatures as a grain toughening measure (Restricted for 24 months until Nov. 2007)</field><field name="creator">Liyanage, Nirmala Damayanthi Lelwala, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">High-temperature processing of rice needs close attention due to the susceptibility of rice grains to fissures. The present study was carried out to redress the lack of information on the quality of rice dried at high-temperatures using a range of drying air temperatures from 160 - 200??C and grain moisture contents varying from 27 to 33%wb. A laboratory type high temperature dryer-oven was developed and constructed, and the performance was compared with commercial fluidized-bed and spouted-bed dryers. The new column type treatment plant, targeted at small-scale rice farmers was designed to reduce milling breakages was tested for high-temperature treatments.  Short term drying (160 ??? 180 seconds) of high moisture rough rice at high-temperatures such as 160 - 200??C increased head rice yield by 5 - 8% in long grain rice and 7 - 11% in medium grain rice. The head rice yield increase achieved was very close to the highest potential head rice recovery possible for a given sample.  The head rice yield increase was mainly due to a hardened surface layer of the rice kernel, formed by two effects, a surface fusion and surface gelatinization during high-temperature treatment. This stress protection layer is only effective for a short period (1 - 2 minutes) at high temperatures.  Tempering of treated grains, either by storing in gunny bags or rapid cooling, can secure the grains to some extent from grain breakage. The highest head rice yield increase was obtained by ceasing the high-temperature effect at the grain moisture level of 24 - 25%wb.  The colour and appearance of high-temperature treated grains were closer to those of untreated grains with the toughness closer to that of parboiled rice. The setback values of high-temperature treated rice measured by RVA, which is a preferred character by consumers, were closer to aged rice. High-temperature treatments did not affect the cooking qualities except a slight increase in water absorption.  The alterations in the grain due to high-temperature treatment are limited to only for 8 - 9% of the total volume (mainly outer region) of the rice grain, preserving more than 90% of the grain with raw-rice quality. Structural changes such as complexing of amylose ??? lipid, amylose -protein and denaturation of protein play a dominant role on quality changes than gelatinization.  A new method introduced to measure the degree of gelatinization of pre-gelatinized rice, using hot paste viscosity by rapid visco analyser (RVA), was successful. The peak viscosity parameter in the RVA was more suitable for measuring the chemical changes in high-temperature treated rice.  Spouted-bed drying technology is not suitable for high-temperature treatment due to the unfavourable conditions for the formation of a hardened layer under intermittent heating and cooling. Fluidized-bed dryers could be used for high-temperature drying, but is not cost effective for the small-scale farmer level.  The novel type treatment plant was successful in reducing the amount of broken grains to almost zero, increasing the head rice yield by 50 - 120kg per 1000kg of rough rice. It was also effective as a germination arrester, inhibiting the germination ability within a very short period such as 30 - 60 seconds. This equipment is more effective as a treatment Plant as it reduces moisture by only 1.5 - 2.0% at highest head rice yield recovery.  An empirical model was successfully established (R2 = 0.99) for grain moisture content (db) and drying temperature during high-temperature processing. In model validation process, a good agreement was found between predicted and experimental data. The modelling between head rice yield and high-temperature drying was unsuccessful (R2 = 0.89) mainly due the interference from other factors such as initial moisture stress due to re-wetting and uncontrolled post treatment drying environment conditions.  The study revealed some breakthrough for the rice industry in addition to its quantitative evaluation of increase in head rice yield.  1. Ability to produce grains with twice the toughness of milled untreated rice, without losing colour and appearance.  2. Fissured grains, previously weakened due to moisture-stress (considered as a loss), can be successfully recovered by treating this high-temperature technique. Currently there is no method available to increase the head rice yield of this type of fissured grains except parboiling, which is not widely accepted among consumers.  3. Drying at 200??C drying temperature completely destroyed the viability of seeds within 40 -60 seconds, hence providing a remedy for germination problems in wet harvests. 4. Since high-temperature drying needs wet rough rice, early harvesting can be done which will reduce shattering losses. This enable the farmers to use the field for an inter-seasonal crop which can utilise higher residual soil moisture in the paddy fields compared to other crops.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rice</field><field name="subject">Processing</field><field name="subject">high temperature</field><field name="subject">yields</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30563</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indonesian foreign policy: a quest for the balance of threats. The role and relevance of elite perceptions in explaining Indonesian foreign policy outcomes.</field><field name="creator">Novotny, Daniel, School of Politics  &amp;  International  Relations, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study is a comprehensive account of Indonesian foreign policy. It analyses the perceptions of the country???s foreign policy elite about other states and the manner in which these shape the decision-making process and determine policy outcomes. It demonstrates that the dynamics of Indonesian foreign relations in the reformasi period can be understood in terms of elite perceptions. Policy-makers??? perceptions are as important as realities, insofar as they shape their real actions. The balance-of-threat theory is the principal analytical tool used to examine elite perceptions. The study argues that the key realist balance-of-power theory lacks the power to explain past dynamics or to predict future direction of Indonesian foreign relations. The balance-of-threat theory is employed here as a predictor about how Indonesia will behave and whether it will implement policies intended to prevent other countries from endangering Indonesia???s national interests and security. The combined qualitative and quantitative research strategy is based on, but by no means limited to, archival study, content analysis of literature and official statements of relevant Indonesian policy-makers and the survey data. The latter approach draws on a series of 45 in-depth interviews with members of the Indonesian foreign policy elite. Indonesian relations with the United States and China are the highest concern of the elite. The leaders believe that, in the future, Indonesia will increasingly have to manoeuvre between the two rival powers. While the United States is currently seen as the main security threat to Indonesia, China is considered the main malign factor in the long run with power capabilities that need to be constrained and counter-balanced. The ambiguity, dichotomy and haphazardness that have characterized Indonesian foreign policy in the reformasi period are caused by four factors: first, the existence of a plurality of disparate views and attitudes among the contemporary Indonesian elite; second, the perceived complex security challenges on all fronts that are both internal and external in origins and traditional and non-traditional in nature; third, a low level of elite consensus about how to rank the external threats according to their urgency; and, fourth, a significant disparity between the elite???s present threat assessment and its long-term threat assessment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30575</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fertility decisions and the sustainability of public pension systems.</field><field name="creator">Steurer, Miriam, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Chapter 2: Welfare comparisons between funded and pay-as-you-go (PAYG) or unfunded pension systems are often made using the Aaron condition (Aaron, 1966). However, the Aaron condition as usually stated is not precise enough about the exact form of the PAYG pension system. PAYG pension systems can be either of the defined benefit or defined contribution variety. They can also differ with regard to intra-generational redistribution, for example pension benefits can be flat or earnings related. Here, four alternative PAYG pension systems are considered. It is shown that each system generates its own Aaron condition. In addition, the standard Aaron condition assumes that the wage rate and labour participation rate does not vary across individuals. These assumptions are also relaxed. Using US data covering the period 1933-2001, it is shown that the results of welfare comparisons are highly sensitive to different specifications of PAYG systems. Chapter 3: The sustainability of a defined benefit pay-as-you-go (DBPAYG) pension system is investigated in the context of an overlapping-generations model of endogenous fertility. The model places particular emphasis on the time costs of child rearing. It illustrates the mechanism by which such a pension system can increase the opportunity cost of having children and hence sow the seeds of its own destruction. The model is then extended to allow for fertility-based payments. Such a system is more likely to be sustainable. These models highlight a number of issues that are of considerable relevance to a number of OECD countries that have generous DBPAYG pension systems and falling fertility rates. Chapter 4: The previous chapter focused on transition dynamics, while this chapter investigates steady state outcomes of fertility based defined benefit pay-as-you-go (DB-PAYG) pension systems in the context of an overlapping-generations model with endogenous fertility and heterogeneous agents. Special attention is paid to the impact on fertility, utility, taxation, and per capita saving. Chapter 5: A two-stage bargaining model is developed to describe how fertility decisions are made in a strategic family setting. Given the assumption that family contracts are incomplete and cannot be used to enforce optimal behaviour, it is shown that investments in children (i.e. the fertility rate) may be sub-optimal. This is because the woman may find it in her interest to invest too little in children in stage 1 of the model in order to protect her bargaining status in stage 2. The chapter then considers in the context of this model the impact on fertility rates of changes in child custody rules (in the case of divorce), the wage rate, and the male-female wage differential. It concludes by exploring how the introduction of child subsidies can change the results.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hardware optimization of JPEG2000</field><field name="creator">Gupta, Amit Kumar, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Key algorithms of JPEG2000, the new image compression standard, have high computational complexity and thus present challenges for efficient implementation. This has led to research on the hardware optimization of JPEG2000 for its efficient realization. Luckily, in the last century the growth in Microelectronics allows us to realize dedicated ASIC solutions as well as hardware/software FPGA based solutions for complex algorithms such as JPEG2000. But an efficient implementation within hard constraints of area and throughput, demands investigations of key dependencies within the JPEG2000 system. This work presents algorithms and VLSI architectures to realize a high performance JPEG2000 compression system. The embedded block coding algorithm which lies at the heart of a JPEG2000 compression system is a main contributor to enhanced JPEG2000 complexity. This work first concentrates on algorithms to realize low-cost high throughput Block Coder (BC) system. For this purpose concurrent symbol processing capable Bit Plane Coder architecture is presented. Further optimal 2 sub-bank memory and an efficient buffer architectures are designed to keep the hardware cost low. The proposed overall BC system presents the highest Figure Of Merit (FOM) in terms of throughput versus hardware cost in comparison to existing BC solutions. Further, this work also investigates the challenges involved in the efficient integration of the BC with the overall JPEG2000 system. A novel low-cost distortion estimation approach with near-optimal performance is proposed which is necessary for accurate rate-control performance of JPEG2000. Additionally low bandwidth data storage and transfer techniques are proposed for efficient transfer of subband samples to the BC. Simulation results show that the proposed techniques have approximately 4 times less bandwidth than existing architectures. In addition, an efficient high throughput block decoder architecture based on the proposed selective sample-skipping algorithm is presented. The proposed architectures are designed and analyzed on both ASIC and FPGA platforms. Thus, the proposed algorithms, architectures and efficient BC integration strategies are useful for realizing a dedicated ASIC JPEG2000 system as well as a hardware/software FPGA based JPEG2000 solution.

It examines the racialisation processes underlying these experiences and explores the strategies employed to respond to and mitigate the impact of being racialised. It addresses the need to develop the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of racialisation and anti-racism in light of the dearth of research work on these especially in Australia.  Different elements from various theories were drawn to frame the empirical investigation since no single theory was adequate as anchor for this qualitative study. In-depth interviews and focus groups with 64 Asian Australians generated rich narratives that provided interesting insights on the personal, political, and spiritual dimensions of human experience that connect the lives of racialised subjects.  Deconstructing stories of racialised subjects laid bare the essence of racist experiences by revealing insights into when and how race becomes a salient signifier of difference. Racialisation provides a productive way of understanding racist experiences since it allows for the unpacking of the multi-layered linked processes of racial categorisation, racial differentiation and problematisation, marginalisation and exclusion, inferiorisation and devaluation. These processes are ordinarily part of the experiences of minority people. They constitute what can be called 'everyday racialisation'.  The study uses stress-coping theory to examine the long-term and cumulative impact of being part of a racialised group. It shows how exposure to racism stressors has multifarious effects on the health and well-being of racialised subjects. The everyday racialisation of minority groups affects their socio-psychological functioning and limits the life chances and economic opportunities available to them.  In addition, the study demonstrates how Asian Australians cope with the stress of their everyday racialisation by drawing from their personal repertoire of discursive, cognitive and behavioural strategies. These, in combination with outside support mechanisms, make up what can be termed ?everyday anti-racism? strategies. Racialisation provides valuable insights into when, how and why racialised subjects deploy these different strategies to negotiate, contest and bridge the constraints and boundaries imposed on them.  The study offers an integrated model for understanding racialisation experience and lays the foundation for developing further the concepts of  'everyday racialisation' and 'everyday antiracism'.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asians -- Australia -- Ethnic identity -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Asians -- Australia -- Social conditions -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Racism -- Australia -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Immigrants -- Australia -- Social conditions -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Race relations -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Emigration and immigration -- Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Statistical methods on detecting superpositional signals in a wireless channel</field><field name="creator">Chan, Francis, Chun Ngai, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The objective of the thesis is concerned on the problem of detecting superpositional signals in a wireless channel. In many wireless systems, an observed signal is commonly represented as a linear combination of the transmitted signal with the interfering signals dispersed in space and time. These systems are generally known as the interference-limited systems. The mathematical model of these systems is generally referred as a superpositional model. A distinguished characteristic of signal transmission in a time-varying wireless channel is that the channel process is not known a priori. Reliable signal reception inherently requires exploiting the structure of the interfering signals under channel uncertainty. Our goal is to design computational efficient receivers for various interference-limited systems by using advanced statistical signal processing techniques. The thesis consists of four main parts. Firstly, we have proposed a novel Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) signal detector, known as the neighbourhood exploring detector (NED). According to the maximum likelihood principle, the space time MIMO detection problem is equivalent to a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. The proposed detector is a sub-optimal maximum likelihood detector which eliminates exhaustive multidimensional searches. Secondly, we address the problem of signal synchronization for Global Positioning System (GPS) in a multipath environment. The problem of multipath mitigation constitutes a joint estimation of the unknown amplitudes, phases and time delays of the linearly combined signals. The complexity of the nonlinear joint estimation problem increases exponentially with the number of signals. We have proposed two robust GPS code acquisition systems with low complexities. Thirdly, we deal with the problem of multipath mitigation in the spatial domain. A GPS receiver integrated with the Inertial Navigation System (INS) and a multiple antenna array is considered. We have designed a software based GPS receiver which effectively estimates the directions of arrival and the time of arrival of the linearly combined signals. Finally, the problem of communications with unknown channel state information is investigated. Conventionally, the information theoretical communication problem and the channel estimation problem are decoupled. However the training sequence, which facilitates the estimation of the channel, reduces the throughput of the channel. We have analytically derived the optimal length of the training sequence which maximizes the mutual information in a block fading channel.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">signal processing -- digital techniques -- mathematics -- statistical methods; MIMO systems; global positon system; inertial navigation systems; mobile communication systems; antenna arrays.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of evaluation on organisational learning: a study of Taiwan's institute of technology libraries</field><field name="creator">Chen, Kuan-nien, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The research question of this thesis is ???what is the relationship between evaluation procedures and organisational learning in an academic library???? The study investigates the nature of organisational learning within Taiwanese institute of technology academic libraries, and in particular the nature of the relationship between the formal institutional evaluation (IE) of those libraries by the Ministry of Education (MoE) and the organisational responses of the libraries. A ???process, phase of organisational learning (PPOL)??? model guided the delineation of research variables and the collection and analysis of data. The subjects of the research were 67 academic libraries and their staff. Phase I of the study consisted pf a questionnaire survey of 312 staff. The results of the survey formed the basis of Phase II of the study, the semi-structured interviews with 24 library personnel, together with an examination of relevant documents of the particular libraries involved. The refinement of the PPOL model is an indication that generally the direction and the use of IE, while recognised by management and employees, do not in most cases translate into higher levels of organisational learning and change. The findings of this thesis apply to the particular types of libraries studied, and to the concept of evaluation and organisational learning. Libraries are automatically to some extent involved in self-evaluation because they must prepare for IE, with some assistance from their institution. However, this does not imply that if various changes occur in the libraries there must be a strong correlation with the existence of high organisational learning. The external nature of the evaluation and the lengthy time periods between evaluations are two factors which make the learning response of libraries more difficult to determine. Ideally, an IE will assist the library on a path of continuous organisational adaptation, which involves structural, communication and climate changes. These changes reflect the ongoing organisational learning activities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Academic libraries -- Taiwan; Organisational learning -- Taiwan</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection of deception in the confessional context</field><field name="creator">Bradford, Deborah, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The ability to successfully distinguish truthful and deceptive messages within forensic contexts is important to preserve the integrity of the legal system. Research has shown that confession evidence is highly persuasive at a trial level and that false confessions leading to wrongful convictions are problematic within the judicial system. Some recent research also suggests that that neither lay observers nor law enforcement professionals are able to successfully distinguish truths and lies in the context of confessions. Therefore, the present safeguards in the judicial system may be inadequate to detect a false confession and prevent subsequent wrongful convictions. The research presented in this thesis was designed to explore the effectiveness of methods of detecting deception within forensically relevant contexts, specifically confessions. Study One examined the impact of presentation modality and the effectiveness of indirect deception measures on credibility assessments of autobiographical accounts depicting truthful and deceptive confessions. The outcome of this study revealed that fact finders were unable to accurately classify truthful and deceptive confessions across presentation modalities and that indirect measures were unsuccessful in this context. In light of these findings, subsequent studies examined the validity of statement content analysis to discern truth from deception within the context of confessions. Study Two assessed evaluations of Criteria-based Content Analysis and the Aberdeen Report Judgment Scales, as applied by untrained observers to discriminate truthful and deceptive confessions. Findings revealed null effects and demonstrated that training in the application of content-based evaluations is an integral element of the valid application of such measures to detecting deception. Studies Three, Four and Five, therefore incorporated a comprehensive training program and focused on the application of a theoretically based method for detecting deception, the Aberdeen Report Judgement  Scales, to the analysis of forensically relevant statements describing confessions, alibis and victimisation accounts. Overall, findings revealed some modest evidence for the application of this framework within deceptive contexts, however, account differences as a function of truth status were often rather small and assessments on many dimensions produced null findings. These results are discussed in terms of theoretical and practical implications for discerning truths and lies within forensic contexts.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">forensic psychology</field><field name="subject">police questioning</field><field name="subject">deception</field><field name="subject">truthfulness and falsehood</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31160</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Slow art : meditative process in painting and drawing</field><field name="creator">Robins, Amanda, School of Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This exegesis is an exploration of meditative process in painting and drawing and accompanies an exhibition of paintings and large drawings called What Lies Beneath.

The methodology involves the examination of the evidence of the work produced by selected artists, looking at the words of artists in notebooks, diaries and interviews and surveying a small number of local contemporary artists. The text opens up the possibilities of drapery and garments and of still life as paths to meditative practice in painting and drawing. The qualities that characterize meditative process/practice, derived from my observations, are categorized. Some of the strengths of these processes are revealed through the examination of the work of artists, both contemporary and historical. The work of Vermeer, Sanchez Cotan, Francisco Zurbaran and contemporary artists Anne Judell, Simon Cooper, Jude Rae, Alison Watt and Eva Hesse highlight different aspects of the meditative process in painting and drawing.

This multi-homing at both ???user??? and ???device??? level presents new opportunities for mobility handling. Mobility may be handled by switching ongoing application data streams between devices, by utilising intermediary adaptation or connectivity enhancement services, or both. However this requires middleware support that is not provided by current systems. This thesis presents a set of integrated solutions to enable this kind of mobility handling, based on concept of Personal Networks (PN). Personal Networks (PN) consist of dynamic conglomerations of terminal and service devices tasked to facilitate the delivery of information to and from a single focal point, which may be a  human user or software agent. This concept creates the potential to view mobility handling as a path selection problem, since there may be multiple valid terminal device and service proxy configurations that can successfully carry a given communication session from one PN to another PN. Depending on context, it may be necessary to switch between paths. To this end, this thesis proposes and evaluates a set of inter-dependent mechanisms to facilitate the discovery and use of different candidate end-to-end paths. The proposal comprises mechanisms for secure inter-device mobility using delegated cryptographic identifiers, autonomous service proxy selection and composition, and distributed resolution of cryptographic identifiers to lower layer addresses.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile networks</field><field name="subject">nemo</field><field name="subject">host identity protocol</field><field name="subject">ipv6</field><field name="subject">mobility</field><field name="subject">security</field><field name="subject">personal networks</field><field name="subject">service composition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contact deformation of carbon coatings: mechanisms and coating design.</field><field name="creator">Singh, Rajnish Kumar, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of a study focussed on the elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for determining the structural integrity of carbon coatings on ductile substrates. Through elucidation of these mechanisms, two different coating systems are designed; a multilayered coating and a functionally graded coating. While concentrating upon carbon coatings, the findings of this study are applicable to a broad range of hard coatings on ductile substrates. The thesis concludes with a chapter outlining a brief study of the effects of gold coatings on silicon under contact load at moderate temperatures to complement the major part of the thesis. Carbon coatings with differing mechanical properties were deposited using plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), filtered assisted deposition (FAD) and magnetron sputtering deposition methods. Combinations of these techniques plus variation of deposition parameters enabled composite multilayered and functionally-graded coatings to also be deposited. Substrates were ductile metals; stainless steel and aluminium. Characterisation of the coating mechanical properties was undertaken using nanoindentation and nano-scratch tests. The same techniques were used to induce fracture within the coatings to allow subsequent analysis of the fracture mechanism. These were ascertained with the assistance of cross-sectional imaging of indents prepared using a focussed ion beam (FIB) mill and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using specimen preparation techniques also utilising the focussed ion beam mill. A two dimensional axisymmetric finite element model (FEM) was built of the coating systems using the commercial software package, ANSYS. Substrate elastic-plastic properties were ascertained by calibrating load-displacement curves on substrate materials with the finite element model results. Utilising the simulation of spherical indentation, the distribution of stresses and the locations for fracture initiation were ascertained using finite element models. This enabled determination of the influence such factors as substrate mechanical properties, residual stresses in the coatings and importantly the variation of elastic properties of the different coating materials. Based upon the studies of monolithic coatings, simulations were undertaken on multilayer and functionally-graded coatings to optimise design of these coating types. Based on the results of the modelling, multilayered and functionally graded coatings were then deposited and mechanical testing undertaken to confirm the models. Three major crack types were observed to occur as the result of the spherical nanoindentation on the coatings; ring, radial and lateral cracks. Ring cracks were found to initiate from the top surface of the film, usually at some distance from the edge of the spherical contact. Radial cracks usually initiated from the interface between the coating and the substrate directly under the symmetry axis of indentation and propagated outwards in a non symmetrical star-like fashion. Lateral cracks formed either between layers in the multilayer coatings or at the interface with substrate. Ring and radial cracks were found to form upon loading whereas lateral cracks formed upon both loading and unloading depending upon the crack driving mechanism. Pop-in events in the load displacement indentation curve were found to be indicative of the formation of ring cracks, while the formation of the other types of cracks was not signified by pop-ins but rather by variations in the slope of the curve. The substrate yield strength was found to influence the initiation of all crack systems while compressive stresses in the coating were seen to only influence the formation of ring and radial cracks. However, it was also noted that the initiation of one form of crack tended to then hinder the subsequent formation of others. In multilayer coatings, the lateral cracks were suppressed, as opposed to the monolayer coating system, but a ring crack was observed. This drawback in the multilayer system was successfully addressed by the design of a graded coating having the highest Young??s modulus at the middle of the film thickness. In this coating, due to the graded nature of the elastic modulus, the stresses at the deleterious locations (top surface and interface) were guided toward the middle of coating and hence increased the load bearing capabilities.  The effect of substrate roughness upon the subsequent surface roughness of the coating and also upon the fracture process of the coating during indentation was also investigated. For the coatings deposited on rough substrates, the radial cracks were observed to form initially and this eventfully delayed the initiation of ring cracks. Also the number of radial cracks observed at the interface was found to be proportional to the distribution of the interfacial asperities. In summary, the study elucidated the fracture mechanisms of monolayer, multilayer and graded carbon coatings on ductile substrates under uniaxial and sliding contact loading. The effects of the yield strength, surface roughness of the substrate, along with the residual stress and elastic modulus of the coatings on the fracture of coatings were investigated. The study utilised finite element modelling to explain the experiments observations and to design coating systems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Carbon</field><field name="subject">Nanoindentation</field><field name="subject">Coating</field><field name="subject">FIB</field><field name="subject">Fracture</field><field name="subject">Silicon</field><field name="subject">Finite element modelling</field><field name="subject">Simulation</field><field name="subject">Carbon composites</field><field name="subject">Protective coatings</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intensional infrastructure for collaborative mapping.</field><field name="creator">Mancilla, Blanca, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the Anita Conti Mapping Server, a Web interface and infrastructure for the creation and presentation of maps using an active, pervasive,multidimensional, global context. For each user, the context contains the parameterizations for every component of the system. In addition, parts of a user???s context may be shared with other users, so that the actions of one user directly affect the look, feel and content of another user???s system, thereby giving new meaning to the term collaborative computing. The mapping server consists of a Web interface, the GMT mapping tools, a database and the Omega typesetting system. Instead of the components being directly attached to each other through point-to-point communication, they are brought together by the context. This approach provides much more flexbility, since new components and new parameters can be more easily added to the overall system, with little or no change to the components already present. The whole infrastructure is built using intensional programming, a form of programming in which software entities are considered to be intensions (in the logical sense), i.e. mappings from contexts to ordinary entities, called extensions. The thesis presents a comprehensive overview of the development of intensional programming, and highlights its relevance for current work in the areas of electronic documents and distributed software configuration management. The mapping server is the most significant intensional application to date: it contains the most number of lines of intensional code ever written with the biggest context space implemented in a real, working system. The thesis focuses on the parameterization of the Web interface, the mapping engine and the generation of correctly typeset labels for maps to create a parameter space that accurately describes these components, and how this parameter space as a whole can be browsed by a user independently or as a member of a collaborative group. This thesis is just the beginning of a new way to look at mapping and proves that focusing on the context allows the creation of powerful extensible software.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Full bibliographic is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pre-coagulation of solid organs</field><field name="creator">Daniel, Steven A., School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Coagulation has and continues to be one of the most important elements in medicine.  Issues from a lack of hemostasis range from poorer clinical outcomes to sudden death.  The evolution of treatments for hemostasis have evolved from the use of Tamponade with direct pressure and bandages, the use of materials such as cobwebs and dust, the use of heat with hot oil or heated irons, to the use of suture, glues, plasmas, staplers, and electricity.  This evolution has continued to bring about the prophylactic use of technology in an effort to prevent blood loss.  This change from reactive treatments to proactive continue to be on a localized or superficial basis.  One of the largest opportunities to proactively reduce blood loss in surgical patients is during the resection of solid organs such as the liver, kidney, and spleen.  Few options have existed to help improve hemostasis short of the complete occlusion of blood supplying the tissue such as in the Pringle Maneuver.  Recent studies have begun to show that practices such as this may have a significant detrimental effect on morbidity.  It has been found that by applying radio frequency electrical energy in a particular way that large amounts of tissue can be pre-coagulated prior to resection.  A series of animal and human clinical work has been completed to help evolve and confirm the method and the device that was created and refined during this effort.  During the course of this work fifty-three patients were treated at four institutions on three continents.  Average blood loss for liver resections performed with this pre-coagulation technique using the developed device in a multicenter control trail was 3.35 ml/cm2 as compared to 6.09 ml/cm2 (p &lt; 0.05) for resections performed using standard surgical techniques alone.   Additionally, the transection time necessary was also reduced from mean value of 27 minutes (2 -- 219 minutes) to 35 minutes (5 -- 65 minutes).  Patients treated included those suffering from liver cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, and post chemotherapy fibrosis.      From this work the use of pre-coagulation with methods and device developed was shown to be safe and effective for reducing the amount of blood loss and transection time during liver resections.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coagulation.</field><field name="subject">Pre-coagulation.</field><field name="subject">Hemostasis.</field><field name="subject">Blood loss.</field><field name="subject">Blood coagulation tests.</field><field name="subject">Hemostasis, Surgical -- Methods.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Powerlines: alternative art and infrastructure in Indonesia in the 1990s.</field><field name="creator">Ingham, Susan Helen, School of Art History &amp; Theory, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates why an alternative visual art and arts infrastructure developed in Indonesia during the 1990s. Initially alternative exhibition spaces developed in response to a lack of outlets through the existing commercial galleries and in reaction to the cultural hegemony of Suharto???s regime, which failed to provide infrastructure for modern art. ???Alternative??? will be extended here to describe an art and an arts infrastructure that became an influential system of power, the gatekeeper for the Indonesian arts community to the international art forum. The background of Alternative art is considered, its sources being in the protest of the New Art Movement, Gerakan Seni Rupa Baru, in the 1970s and an on-going art student rebellion against the modern and decorative art taught in the art academies. Contemporary artists sought content that reflected the many issues confronting Indonesian society, and rejected that art focusing on formal properties particularly in painting, which, by avoiding contention, served the purposes of Suharto???s regime. Particular examples are explored to define the lines of power that evolved: firstly the alternative gallery, Cemeti, and secondly the curator, Jim Supangkat and his theoretical justification for Indonesian contemporary art for the international forum. Finally the career structure of Heri Dono is examined to identify the mechanisms for artistic success through international contacts. This investigation concludes that power and influence became dependent on recognition in the international forum. Western and later Asian institutions, in selecting work for the high profile survey exhibitions proliferating in the 1990s, worked almost exclusively with this network. Their preference was for installation art that reflected the socio-political context in which it was made, and the few artists who were selected developed careers very different from their colleagues in Indonesia, some becoming nomadic art stars. This relationship between the Indonesian and the international art network has gained recognition for Indonesian contemporary art and an outlet for suppressed issues and marginalised people, but did not provide a fully balanced representation of Indonesian culture and reiterated the systems and paradigms of the West in relation to Asian art.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dono, Heri, 1960-.</field><field name="subject">Supangkat, Jim.</field><field name="subject">Cemeti Art House.</field><field name="subject">Art -- Indonesia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sing at the Moon: the contextual narrative of isolation and grief in Australian women???s writing.</field><field name="creator">Hill, Barbara, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">???Sing at the Moon: the contextual narrative of isolation and grief in Australia women???s writing??? comprises two complementary elements of a single thesis: a novel and a critical essay. My novel takes as its starting point the impact of unsolved murders on small regional communities and uses this to explore the effects of isolation and grief on subjectivities, particularly women???s. The novel represents an original contribution to that strand of contemporary Australian fiction, especially as written by women, which deals with the Australian bush myth and the effects on women of the masculinism of Australian national identity. The critical component of my thesis examines Thea Astley???s Drylands and Dorothy Hewett???s Neap Tide in terms of how each novel engages with Australian literary traditions and offers an explicit critique of Australian masculinist culture. I focus on the ways the novels represent violence against women and show how this violence works to underpin the masculinist myth of mateship - to reveal a more sinister underbelly of Australian culture. Their critique of Australian masculinist culture also works at the level of form where both writers subvert a traditional ???realist??? form for political as well as aesthetic purposes. I see myself primarily as a writer and feminist who uses theory and criticism as a way of reflecting on my own creative practice in the light of writing as social responsibility. My approach both to my own novel and to Drylands and Neap Tide is shaped by Susan Lever???s proposal that ???writing and reading lie at the heart of feminism; they are the means by which women can explore and communicate the deepest aspects of their condition??? (2000,132). In my essay I am interested in providing a critical context for the novel by exploring feminist theories of subjectivity and the ways these can be represented in fiction. As a result I will analyse some of the narrative conventions employed in Hewett???s and Astley???s novels. I will show that the work of both writers operates in the context of an Australian literary tradition ??? both past and present ??? and informs and negotiates new ways that accommodate feminist concerns with fictional practice.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rethinking the politics of distribution: the geographies and governmentalities of housing assistance in rural New South Wales, Australia.</field><field name="creator">Dufty, Rae, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Housing, while a necessity of ???life???, goes beyond this definition in this research to also become a technology of government in the domestic distributional geopolitics of nation-states. Employing a Foucaultian approach to power and governance, this research examines how the provision of housing assistance was used in the government of rural public housing communities. Data for this research were collected through a series of archival resources that focused specifically on the transitional periods of 1935-1955 and 1985-2005. Data were also gathered through a questionnaire and interviews with public housing tenants and staff from four towns (Griffith, Cootamundra, Junee and Tumut) in the ???Riverina??? region of south-western New South Wales (NSW), Australia. This research makes five contributions to geographical understandings of distributional politics. First, the thesis contends that poststructuralist theoretical approaches to the analysis of power and governance enable innovative critical engagements with the distributional geopolitical agendas of governmental processes. The research also found that the distributional geopolitical agendas of Governments have been pursued through more than just the redistribution of fiscal resources, but also include the redistribution of human resources. In particular, housing assistance has been, and is used today, to perpetuate certain internal migration patterns to aid this human-distributional agenda. Third, the study argues that ??? while the broad shift to advanced liberal forms of government have resulted in changes to how distributional geopolitical agendas are pursued ??? ???distribution??? remains an integral feature of the geopolitical objectives of those who seek to govern in advanced liberal ways. This work also shows how these new advanced liberal distributional objectives remain open to being problematised and/or resisted at the local scale. However, while such governmental processes are always uncertain and open to contestation, these changes have brought about a new set of ethical and political consequences.

These putative ???vascular??? risk factors have increasingly been recognised to increase the risk of cognitive impairment in the absence of clinically manifest ischemic events. Their relationship to structural brain changes has received limited attention.  In this dissertation, I used high resolution magnetic resonance image (MRI) to examine two structural features of the brain, regional gray matter (GM) volumes and silent lacunar infarcts, and determined their association with vascular risk factors.  I related these to cognitive function in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The work was based on the data of three waves in two healthy cohorts drawn from the PATH Through Life Study, which is a population-based longitudinal study of ageing comprising 3 cohorts aged 20-24, 40-44, and 60-64 years, with about 2500 participants in each cohort. Random subsamples of Wave 1 of the cohort aged 60-64 years (N = 478) and Wave 2 of the 40+ cohort (aged 44-48 years) (N = 411) were examined cross-sectionally for the MRI sub-study. The MRI cohort aged 60-64 years was re-examined 4 years later in Wave 2. These studies showed that vascular risk factors are associated with lower regional GM volumes and this association varies at different ages. In adults aged 44-48 years, individual risk factors did not show a significant relationship with GM volumes, but the Framingham risk score was associated with less GM volumes in a number of brain regions, suggesting an additive effect of the risk factors. In the 60+ cohort, hypertension was independently associated with less regional GM volumes in bilateral medial frontal, right superior frontal, left superior temporal and precentral gyri. The same cohort, when examined in Wave 2, showed the negative association of hypertension with gray matter volumes to be more widespread. These associations were observed in men but not in women in either wave. Sex dimorphism was observed in the younger cohort as well, with greater GM volumes in temporal and occipital cortices, midbrain and cerebellum in men, while less GM volumes in cingulate and parietal cortices in comparison with women. Lacunar infarcts were present in 7.8 % of the 60+ cohort, and asymptomatic new lacunar lesions developed in 0.4 % per year in this group. The prevalence of lacunar infarcts was correlated with hypertension and a steeper decline in mental speed. These series of studies indicate the relationship of vascular risk factors with changes in brain structure and cognitive function in healthy middle-aged adults. It is suggested that modifying these vascular risk factors may protect the brain from silent lesions and cognitive impairment, and that intervention should begin early in life to have a major impact.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vascular risk factors.</field><field name="subject">Brain.</field><field name="subject">Magnetic resonance imaging.</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular diseases.</field><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease.</field><field name="subject">Middle aged persons.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of asymmetric signalling pathways on the mouse heart development.</field><field name="creator">Furtado, Milena Bastos, St. Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the major cause of death in the first year of life, the estimated incidence being 0.5-5% of live births; therefore it is important to understand the genetic causes underlying the complex process of heart formation to help prophylaxis, diagnosis and treatment of affected patients. CHD is the commonest phenotype associated with left-right (LR) disorders. LR asymmetry is determined during embryonic development. The three major body axes ? antero-posterior, dorso-ventral and left-right ? are patterned at gastrulation. LR asymmetry is established shortly after the two other major axes are patterned. The process of LR determination can be sub-divided into four integrated steps: 1. breaking of molecular symmetry in the gastrulation organizer; 2. transfer or relay of this asymmetric information to the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM), from which most internal organs will be formed; 3. reinforcement and propagation of asymmetric cues throughout the LPM and 4. conversion of asymmetric molecular information into proper organ morphogenesis.  The goal of this work is to investigate mechanisms involved at two specific points in the laterality pathway: the initial generation/maintenance of asymmetric gene expression in the LPM and the morphogenetic translation of these early events into correct heart formation in the mouse. My emphasis has been on the characterization of laterality targeted cells via careful analysis of Pitx2c expression using a Pitx2c-lacZ reporter transgene, the role of BMP signalling, via Smad1, in generation/maintenance of early asymmetric signalling in the LPM, and the later involvement of both Smad1 and Pitx2 in cardiac morphogenesis through analyses of knockout mice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">laterality</field><field name="subject">heart</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">Nodal</field><field name="subject">Pitx2</field><field name="subject">Congenital heart disease</field><field name="subject">Mice as laboratory animals</field><field name="subject">Morphogenesis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radiotherapy in cancer care: estimating the optimal utilization from a review of evidence-based clinical guidelines.</field><field name="creator">Delaney, Geoffrey, South-west Sydney Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction: Radiotherapy utilization rates for cancer vary widely internationally. It has previously been suggested that approximately 50% of all cancer patients should receive radiation. However, this estimate was not evidence-based. The aim of this study was to estimate the ideal proportion of new cases of cancer that should receive radiotherapy at least once during the course of their illness based on the best available evidence.  Materials and Methods: An optimal radiotherapy utilization tree was constructed for each cancer based upon indications for radiotherapy taken from evidence-based treatment guidelines. The proportion of patients with clinical attributes that indicated a possible benefit from radiotherapy was obtained by adding epidemiological data to the radiotherapy utilization tree. The optimal proportion of patients with cancer that should receive radiotherapy was then calculated using TreeAge software. Sensitivity analyses using univariate analysis and Monte Carlo simulations were performed.  Results: The proportion of patients with cancer in whom external beam radiotherapy is indicated according to the best available evidence was calculated to be 52%. Monte Carlo analysis indicated that the 95% confidence limits were from 51.7% to 53.1%. The tightness of the confidence interval suggests that the overall estimate is robust. Comparison with actual radiotherapy utilization data suggests a shortfall in actual radiotherapy delivery.  Conclusion: This methodology allows comparison of optimal rates with actual rates to identify areas where improvements in the evidence-based use of radiotherapy can be made. It provides valuable data for radiotherapy service planning.

I use my own experience of growing up in Italian and Anglo Australian cultures as a primary source to examine the changing nature of memory affects and to consider they ways in which events of the past have formed and transformed my cultural identity. I also explore the intermingling of personal and collective memory and how ethnic groups negotiate community identity within national identity formations. Concepts of Deleuze and Guattari, particularly those of the rhizome, the refrain and territorialisation, are keys to understanding practices associated with memory and identity and I apply them throughout the thesis. Nostalgia and loss are emotions often tangled up with memory and identity and I use the work of Barthes, Stewart and Woodward in discussing these. I use other diverse theories to look at the ways memory is embedded in the body ?? manifested in gestures, performance and everyday practices ?? and mediated in rituals, film, photographs, documents and objects. The style of writing does not adhere to the conventions of academic discourse and diverts intermittently from scholarly argumentation. It assembles disparate memory events ?? both personal and collective ?? along with factual information, fragments of biography and autobiography, and reflection and analysis. It is written this way in part to resemble the process of thinking and remembering which is never a smooth, logically flowing stream of intelligence.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41224</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polyurethane/carbon nanotube composites for biomedical applications.</field><field name="creator">Williams, Charles, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Carbon nanotube (CNT) polymer composites have attracted much attention since the extraordinary electrical and mechanical properties of CNTs were realised. However research into biomedical applications of CNT/polymer composites has received little attention. The aim of this thesis was to fabricate an electrically conductive, biocompatible polymer based on a poly(ether)urethane (PEU) with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) as the conductive filler. Paramount to achieving this was to obtain good dispersion and integration of MWNTs within the host polymer matrix. A number of different strategies were investigated including high energy mixing of MWNTs in PEU and covalent functionalisation of MWNTs with long chain hydrocarbons, poly(tetramethylene oxide) (PTMO) and poly(acrylic acid) (pAA) for enhanced miscibility with PEU. The impact of these strategies was assessed by testing the tensile properties, electrical conductivity as well as cytotoxicity of resulting MWNT/PEU composites. It was found that high energy mixing in the presence of MWNTs caused severe degradation of PEU, resulting in significant cytotoxicity and reductions in composite tensile strength. Covalent functionalisation of MWNTs was achieved by utilising defect group chemistry to attach a range of molecules. PTMO covalently attached to MWNTs was found to cause significant nanotube aggregation in PEU composites. Long chain hydrocarbons covalently attached to MWNTs exhibited enhanced dispersability in PEU with increasing molecular weight, attributed to disrupting intertube Van der Waals forces and providing favourable hydrophobic interactions with PEU. Additionally these composites exhibited increased conductivity and decreased cytotoxicity with increasing hydrocarbon length. However increasing long chain hydrocarbon molecular weight also caused significant reductions in MWNT conductivity. MWNTs surface modified with carboxylic acid groups exhibited favourable hydrophilic interactions with PEU but did not retain tensile properties at nanotube loadings where electrical conductivity was significant. Successful polymerisation of acrylic acid monomer initiated from MWNTs using a reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerisation was demonstrated. Resulting pAA-MWNTs exhibited enhanced dispersability in water but not in PEU composites, resulting in severe degradation in composite tensile properties. PAA-MWNTs also exhibited decreased conductivity with increasing pAA molecular weight. Incorporating MWNTs in PEU composites has been demonstrated to impart multi-functionality to existing biomaterials for potential uses in a range of biomedical applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41023</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cross-modal experience in music and visual art: their correspondences and a new perspective of appreciation in education.</field><field name="creator">Chu, Kalaly, School of English, Media &amp; Performing Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Abstract  The originality and significance of this research is to use a?cross-modal? perspective to experience the ?multi-dimensional? nature of the arts, specifically in the area of music and the visual arts. This research will focus on investigating common cross-disciplinary attributes and apply them in the realm of ?appreciation? in aesthetic education in music and visual art. 	The three major research problems and issues in this dissertation are as follows: (1) What are the common elements in music and the visual arts? (2) Do people make correspondences between music and painting by using the work of painters and musicians? (3) How do we define the role of music and its adaptability in linking with other expressive forms in contemporary education? Ultimately, the entire dissertation serves to redefine the ?value? and uniqueness of the arts (music and visual art) in the holistic development of an individual, in particularly in moulding and enhancing the skills of personal and cultural expression.  	The aims in this research are taken from various angles which correspond with the questions about ?interdisciplinary study? and the ideas of ?changing teaching and learning? in the 21st century. Interdisciplinary Studies has been a term which has provoked a great deal of controversy in current educational development, particularly in Asian countries, and especially in music education. The originality of this research lies in three areas. First, a cross-modal perspective is used to explore the common elements in music and visual art, especially in the dimensions of ?brightness?, ?intensity? and ?line?. Second, a cross-modal perspective in music will be adopted. Instead of focusing on the melody, harmony and form of music repertoire, sensory qualities, such as ?brightness?, ?intensity? and ?line? will be used as musical vocabulary to interpret cross-modal perception in experiencing the arts. Third, this dissertation will investigate the art experience, especially the thinking and cognitive appraisal in viewing the arts, of the creators and the spectators.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">visual arts</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">perception</field><field name="subject">aesthetics</field><field name="subject">art</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Employers and industrial relations in the Australian meat processing industry: An historical analysis.</field><field name="creator">O'Leary, Patrick John, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Some industrial relations researchers have considered the meat processing industry as one of the more strike-prone industries in Australia. Many researchers have analysed this industry from either a political economy perspective or a union industrial relations perspective. This thesis acknowledges this body of literature, but takes as its focus the ways that employers have shaped the industry?s industrial relations. Employers, far from being reactive or even passive actors in shaping the industry?s industrial relations, have taken a long-term active role in this area. This thesis, therefore, focuses on an historical analysis of the changing roles of employers and employer associations in the industry?s industrial relations. This thesis will identify and link the relevant theoretical literature to the historical narrative, and then link this to actual events through three case studies analysing three exemplar employers. The findings of this thesis are that employers have had and made strategic choices about the industry?s industrial relations, at the workplace, industry and national-levels. The rise of AMH, which forms much of the second half of the narrative and analysis, shaped the industry?s industrial relations in ways not seen before in the Australian meat processing industry. Thus, the strategic choices on by many medium and larger meat-industry employers at the time, proved ineffective in the face of AMH?s success in driving down the cost of the wage-effort bargain, rendering many uncompetitive on both the input and output sides of the product market.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">meat industry</field><field name="subject">employers</field><field name="subject">industrial relations</field><field name="subject">strategic choice</field><field name="subject">Meat industry and trade -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A domain-driven approach for detecting event patterns in e-markets: a case study in financial market surveillance.</field><field name="creator">Mangkorntong, Piyanath (Aim), Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this research, we look at the problem of detecting complex situations arising in Electronic Markets or e-markets. E-markets have been growing in size rapidly over the past few years. Large amounts of transactions are being generated from e-markets everyday so data analysis tools are required for several business processes such as market strategy evaluation or illegal trading activity detection. However, our literature review shows existing tools available today still cannot overcome all the main challenges such as dealing with a large amount of incoming real-time data from multiple market feeds and providing a user with no programming skills the ability to extract data efficiently. This thesis proposes to address this problem using the Event Processing concept. We model an e-market as a distributed event-driven system. Therefore, we can refer to e-market transactions as events and use an Event Processing System (EPS) as a data analysis tool. To implement our solution, we propose a new EPS architecture that allows the integration of several existing EPSs (called slave EPSs) under a unified domain-specific user interface and execution environment. Since different EPSs rely on different data models and event pattern models, our proposal also includes a unified e-market data model and event pattern framework for defining, composing and executing event patterns. Selected common event patterns used for financial market surveillance in several stock exchanges have been used to evaluate the proposed work. The proposed event pattern framework has proved that it has the capability of expressing event patterns of varying complexities. In terms of the proposed EPS architecture, a system prototype has been successfully developed using two sophisticated commercial systems, Coral8 and SMARTS, as slave EPSs. The experiments performed involve the execution of selected event patterns against real historical data from the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). Our solution is cost-efficient and provides a number of benefits that can be used in practice. The proposed data model and event pattern framework can be used during the requirement gathering phase. The proposed EPS architecture provides users a unified interface with no programming skills for application development and the ability to customise and execute event patterns for different existing EPSs. Moreover, it can be used to facilitate the suitable EPS selection to achieve a more efficient event pattern detection process.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monumental amnesia: reading the spatial narratives written by contemporary urban landscapes.</field><field name="creator">Rozentals, Darien Jane, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">Monumental Amnesia: Reading the Spatial Narratives Written by Contemporary Urban Landscapes This thesis analyses the spatial stories inscribed into urban landscapes by monuments. Differentiating between officially sanctioned, symbolic, and everyday monuments, this thesis theorises the narratological space composed by these objects: static, imagined and transitional, respectively. It argues that monumental sites are spaces of forgetting, rather than remembering, characterised through invisibility, opacity and mystification. Infused with paradox, monuments simultaneously reveal and conceal the histories and urban memories they are expected to commemorate. The discussion then turns to contemporary art, in particular memory installations, as a practice that counters the mystification inherent within urban space, actively exposing alternative pasts and memories. The thesis is divided into three chapters. The first analyses the contemporary, officially sanctioned monuments of Vilnius, Lithuania that celebrate an ancient nationalism, alongside two neighboring sculpture parks that display retired Soviet icons, with a particular focus on Gintaris Karosas?? sculpture Infotree LNK. The second chapter theorises symbolic monuments, and focuses on the Japanese theme park Tobu World Square as a curiosity cabinet where the contemporary spatial practice, identified by Anthony Giddens, of ??disembedding?? is performed in miniature. It concludes with a discussion of Susan Norrie??s DVD installation of the park ENOLA. The third chapter examines everyday monuments, focusing on the industrial ruins of Manchester to unravel the archival aspects of these monuments and their gentrification. It closes with a study of Cornelia Parker??s installation Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View. Through these urban case studies and accompanying memory installations, the thesis explores how urban monuments disguise certain histories and memories of a city, and how art can reclaim alternative stories and memories from urban amnesia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Packing of particles during softening and melting process.</field><field name="creator">Zheng, Xiao-Qin, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Softening deformation of iron ore in the form of sinter, pellet, and lump ore in the cohesive zone of an ironmaking blast furnace is an important phenomenon that has a significant effect on gas permeability and consequently blast furnace production efficiency. The macroscopic softening deformation behavior of the bed and the microscopic deformation behavior of the individual particles in the packed bed are investigated in this study using wax balls to simulate the fused layer behavior of the cohesive zone. The effects of softening temperature, load pressure, and bed composition (mono - single melting particles, including pure or blend particles vs binary ??? two different melting point particles) on softening deformation are examined. The principal findings of this study are: 1. At low softening temperatures, an increase in load pressure increases the deformation rate almost linearly. 2. At higher softening temperatures, an increase in load pressure dramatically increases the deformation rate, and after a certain time there is no more significant change in deformation rate. 3. The bed deformation rate of a mono bed is much greater than that of a binary one. 4. In a binary system, the softening deformation rate increases almost proportionally with the increase in the amount of lower melting point wax balls. 5. In a mono system with blend particles, the content of the lower melting point material has a more significant effect on overall bed deformation than the higher melting point one. 6. The macro softening deformation of the bed behaves the theory of creep deformation. 7. A mathematical model for predicting bed porosity change due to softening deformation based on creep deformation theory has been developed. 8. Increase in load pressure also reduces the peak contact face number of the distribution curves, and this is more prominent with higher porosity values. 9. The contribution of contact face number to bed porosity reduction is more pronounced in a mono system than in a binary system. 10. The porosity reduction in a binary bed is more due to the contact face area increase, presumably of the lower melting point particles. 11. The mono system has a single peak contact face number distribution pattern while the binary system exhibits a bimodal distribution pattern once the higher melting point material starts to deform. 12. In a binary system, an increase in deformation condition severity tends to reduce the contact face number of the higher melting point material without having to increase the contact face number of the lower melting point material accordingly to achieve a given porosity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Softening.</field><field name="subject">Creep mechanism.</field><field name="subject">Particle packing.</field><field name="subject">Particles.</field><field name="subject">Deformations (Mechanics) -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The functionalization of carbon nanotubes.</field><field name="creator">Liu, Rongmei, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this project was to investigate methods for purification and modification of Single Wall and Multi Wall Carbon Nanotubes. Covalent and noncovalent approaches to functionalization were studied. The dispersibility, structure and electronic properties of modified tubes were characterized by Raman, UV-vis-NIR and XPS. Fluorescence, NMR and TEM were further employed to characterize the interaction between nanotubes and non-covalent modifiers. The effects of five different purification methods on the dispersibility, and degree of carboxylic acid functionality of SWCNTs, along with the level of defects on the tube side walls, and the resulting electronic properties of SWCNTs have been investigated. It was found that all oxidation treatments successfully removed metallic oxides and amorphous carbon impurities, while different oxidation treatments introduced different levels of oxidized sites on the SWCNTs. Heat treatment after oxidation eliminated some of the carboxylic groups introduced by oxidation. SWCNTs covalently functionalized by aromatic diazonium salts containing nitro, carboxylate and fluoro groups on the aromatic ring were prepared. Heating of these tubes in vacuum at 350_C for 5 h partially reversed the effects of functionalization. However, due to the low degree of functionalization achieved in the preliminary studies, the dispersibility/solubility of functionalized tubes did not greatly improve. The interaction in stable suspensions of CNTs with positively or negatively charged pyrene derivatives via noncovalent functionalization, was extensively studied. 1-pyrene methylamine hydrochloride gave most stable dispersions. 1H and 2H NMR spectroscopy of MWCNTs/1-pyrene methylamine hydrochloride dispersion in DMF-d7 showed that the broadened signals are associated with weakly or unbound pyrene, while strongly bound pyrene is not observable in solution-state NMR. The strong pyrene attachment on MWCNTs by &#960;-&#960; stacking can be reversed by dialysis and/or extensive washing. Biological molecules such as polypeptides and amino acids also dispersed MWCNTs into solvents by noncovalent modification. It is found that polytryptophan demonstrated the greatest ability to disperse MWCNTs. Digestion with chymotrypsin enabled polytryptophan binding to be reversed. A combination of tube cutting and non-covalent functionalization by pyrenes or peptides enables tubes to be suspended/dissolved in solvents such as DMF and ethanol, and significantly allows tubes to be manipulated for practical device applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Carbon</field><field name="subject">Nanotubes</field><field name="subject">Nanostructure materials</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and modelling of membrane heat exchanger in HVAC energy recovery systems.</field><field name="creator">Nasif, Mohammad Shakir, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The performance of membrane heat exchangers for HVAC total energy recovery systems was evaluated through experimentation and detailed system modelling. The operating principle of the membrane heat exchanger (enthalpy heat exchanger) is based on passing ambient hot and humid supply air over one side of a porous membrane heat exchanger surface and cold and less humid room exhaust air on the other side of the transfer surface. Due to the gradient in temperature and vapour pressure, both heat and moisture are transferred across the membrane surface causing a decrease in temperature and humidity of the supply air before it enters the evaporator unit of the conventional air conditioner. Hence both sensible and latent energy are recovered. In this study, both experimental and numerical investigations were undertaken and mathematical models were developed to predict the performance of the latent heat recovery heat exchangers for use with conventional air conditioning systems. The membrane moisture transfer resistance was determined by a laboratory-scale permeability measurements. It was found that the membrane heat exchanger performance is significantly influenced by the heat exchanger flow profile and shape, heat and moisture transfer material characteristics, air velocity and air moisture content. Improvement of membrane heat exchanger performance requires an in depth study on flow, temperature and moisture distribution in the heat exchanger flow paths. Thus, a commercial CFD package FLUENT is used to model the membrane heat exchanger. However, software of this type cannot model moisture diffusion through the porous transfer boundary. Therefore, two user defined function codes have been introduced to model the moisture transfer in latent energy heat exchangers. The annual energy consumption of an air conditioner coupled with a membrane heat exchanger is also studied and compared with a conventional air conditioning cycle using the HPRate software. Energy analysis shows that in hot and humid climates where the latent load is high, an air conditioning system coupled with a membrane heat exchanger consumes less energy than a conventional air conditioning system. The membrane heat exchanger dehumidifies the air before it enters the air conditioning system, resulting in a decrease in energy consumption in comparison with conventional air conditioning system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heat exchangers</field><field name="subject">Heat recovery</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable natural resources policy and management in relation to water diversions with special reference to the south-to-north water transfer project in China.</field><field name="creator">Chen, Ji, Graduate Research Program in Environmental Policy &amp; Management, UNSW</field><field name="description">China has undertaken a vast engineering project: the large-scale transfer of water from the south of the country to the north, the intention being to alleviate flooding in the south and water shortages in the north. It may take up to fifty years to complete. This thesis examines the broad outline of the scheme, the planning that has gone into it, its historical and political background, and the political, social, and ecological problems that it has encountered and may be likely to cause in the future. The political context of a 'pro-technology' policy amongst today's Chinese leaders is highlighted. The Chinese study is made in the light of water-transfer schemes that have been implemented, or proposed, in other countries; and also ideas about sustainable development, policy processes, and natural resource management.  Five case studies are considered: the Aral Sea (Central Asia), the Snowy Mountain Scheme (Australia), the National Hydrological Plan (Spain), the Central Arizona Project (the United States) and the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (China). They are examined as a basis for understanding policy problems and processes in water resource management, and also to make some suggestions for their resolution in the Chinese case&#8213;though finding a permanent or definitive solution lies beyond the scope of the present inquiry.  The difficulties for traditional policy processes to manage uncertainty and complexity are particularly acute in the area of natural resource management. For example, climate change issues challenge present water management systems and diversion projects. Therefore, uncertainty and complexity issues, beyond the 'ideal' policy cycle, are considered, particularly in relation to climate change, but also the water diversion schemes themselves.

This thesis develops our understanding and investigates the benefits provided by external accountants, through auditing and business advisory services, to Australian SMEs. The relatively unregulated SME environment provides a unique opportunity to examine the market for professional services. SMEs, for example, can choose to be audited or not, and there is significant variation in the level of agency conflict they face. This thesis analyses data collected from two surveys of Australian SMEs. While theory suggests that auditing is a costeffective response to agency conflict, measures of this conflict are found to be associated with voluntary demand for external auditing, but not for internal auditing. Though the nature of the relationship between external and internal audit is unclear, a negative association is found between the two, suggesting substitution between these services. Whereas external audit is provided to reduce agency conflict, internal audit may be substituting for other services, unrelated to agency issues, such as providing useful information for decision making. I also investigate the economic benefit SMEs derive from auditing by measuring whether audited SMEs pay a lower interest rate on their major institutional borrowings compared with unaudited SMEs, or demonstrate superior performance. I find no evidence of a direct economic benefit on either of those measures. External accountants have responded to increasingly broad-ranging market information needs by providing an expanded range of business advisory services, and this thesis also investigates the relationship between external audit and business advice in the context of this changing market. Despite theory suggesting a complementary relationship, SMEs spend less on business advice when they also buy an audit, and this finding persists irrespective of agency considerations. The main purpose of business advice is to help improve firm performance, and SMEs buying business advice are found to perceive their business to be outperforming their competitors. This suggests a benefit associated with these services.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Small business.</field><field name="subject">Accountants</field><field name="subject">Auditing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The payout phase of a defined contribution retirement income arrangement: the role of annuities.</field><field name="creator">Doyle, Suzanne, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the economic issues associated with the payout phase where a defined contribution (DC) retirement arrangement is adopted. In particular, the role of annuities in providing a retirement income is examined as well as insurance they provide against retirement risks such as inflation, longevity and rate of return volatility.  A comprehensive money&#146;s worth calculation based on a Australian population cohort mortality table shows that overall, Australian nominal and inflation indexed life annuities provide relatively good value for money. Although relative to annuities sold in the US and the UK they do suffer from relatively high adverse selection costs, which could in turn reduce demand. In addition, the presence of a government provided safety net pension could also result in low demand for annuities.  These two issues suggest that government intervention may be warranted to ensure retirees have access to affordable private insurance to protect their retirement benefit. This could take the form of mandating an annuity purchase at retirement. However, which annuity should be mandated is not well understood. This is an important question as there are many alternative annuity designs, each providing different degrees of retirement risk protection to an individual.  This thesis uses numerical simulations to empirically analyse the costs and benefits of mandating alternative annuities from both an individual and government&#146;s perspectives to determine optimal annuity design.  A model is used to estimate the value of payouts over time from various types of annuities across a range of retirement benefits. A means tested safety net pension is assumed to exist. Two stochastic variables &#151; inflation and the risky rate of return, are simultaneously used to show how the annuity payouts react to theses changes, highlighting the insurance features of various annuities.  Consumer preferences for the various annuities are estimated based on tolerance to risk. The variable annuity dominates the utility rankings under two conditions: -- when the relative risk aversion is low and a safety net payment isn&#146;t available, and when the relative risk aversion is high and a safety net payment is made. Otherwise the CPI indexed annuity has the highest ranking. Sensitivity analysis shows that the results presented here are robust to a number of alternative assumptions about the key variables.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Annuities.</field><field name="subject">Retirement income -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computing order statistics over data streams.</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Ying, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Statistics computation over data streams is often required by many applications, including processing of relational type queries, data mining and high speed network management. Among various s tatistics, order statistics computation is one of the most challenging, and is employed in many real applications, such as web ranking aggregation and log mining, sensor data analysis, trends and fleeting opportunities detection in stock markets and load balanced data partitioning for distributed computation. In this thesis, we investige three important problems in computing order statistics over data streams: 1. Computing rank queries over data streams with relative error guarantee. 2. Computing rank queries over data streams with duplication. 3. Computing top-k ranked queries on the sliding window. We first consider the problem of continuously maintaining order sketches over data streams with a relative rank error guarantee &#949;. Two space-efficient and onescan randomised algorithms are developed. And they are immediately applicable to approximately compute quantiles over data stream with relative error guarantee &#949; and significantly improve the space bound of previous work. In many real applications including data streams, data elements may be observed and recorded multiple times. Without uniqueness assumption on observed data elements, many conventional statistics computation problems need to be reinvestigated. To address the problem of order statistics computation against data streams with duplicate, we develop a novel, space-efficient one scan theoretical framework, based on an existing technique for counting distinct elements, to continuously maintain sketches so that rank-based queries can be approximately processed with a relative error guarantee &#949;. Moreover, we also propose two timeefficient algorithms. Finally, we study the problem of computing top-k ranked queries over the sliding window. Based on the observation that the K-Skyband of the elements is the minimal candidate set for the top-k ranked queries with arbitrary monotone preference functions where k &#8804; K, we develop novel algorithms to continuously maintain the K-Skyband over the sliding window. Efficient query algorithm is presented to support the massive top-k ranked queries in real time.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improvement of bearing strength of laminated composites by nanoclay and Z-pin reinforcement.</field><field name="creator">Huong, Tran Phuong Nam, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The bearing behavior of bolted composite joints is significantly poorer than that of their metallic counterparts. The objective of the present study was to examine ways of improving the bearing performance of bolted joints in carbon fibre reinforced epoxy laminates. Two strategies were examined, namely stiffening of the matrix using nanofillers and through- thickness reinforcement of the laminates using z- pins. The development of a nanoparticle reinforced matrix resin, and its performance in a composite loaded in bearing, was the focus of the first part of the study. A commercial nanoclay, I30E from Nanocor, was chosen as the reinforcement since the nanoclay particles are modified with long alkyl chain amines which improves dispersion in the epoxy resin. The c onditions for preparing nanocomposites based on the nanoclay were examined for two epoxy resin systems , DGEBA and TGDDM. Significant improvements in the elastic modulus were obtained , with a 20% increase being recorded w ith 8.4 phr nanoclay content in the DGEBA resin and a 50% increase with 20 phr nanoclay content in the TGDDM system. Carbon fibre reinforced laminates w ere prepared from nanoclay reinforced TGGDM matrix resin, using a vacuum assisted prepregging process. The bearing strength and stiffness of the laminated composites was improved by 7% and 15% respectively but the strain to failure was reduced. The addition of nanoclay to the matrix resin was found to change the failure mode. Enhancement of the bearing performance of laminates by through-thickness reinforcement (z-pins) was examined as the second strategy trialed in this thesis. The bearing strength, stiffness and energy to failure of carbon fibre laminates was found to increase progressively with increasing volume content of z-pins , with increases of 10%, 10% and 16%, respectively , being achieved at a z-pin volume content of 4%. No significant change in strength, stiffness or failure energy was observed when the z-pin diameter was changed from 0.28 to 0.51 mm at the same volume content.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Touching at depth: intimate spaces in the Japanese family.</field><field name="creator">Tahhan, Diana Adis, Languages &amp; Linguistics, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Touch, as it is conventionally conceived, appears to be lacking in Japanese intimate relationships. Physical or visible forms of intimate touch are generally relegated to particular body practices or contexts such as co-bathing and co-sleeping, and are usually uncharacteristic of everyday experiences of intimacy. Instead, Japanese relationships are commonly defined in terms of subtle forms of communication, such as ishin denshin (heart-to-heart communication) and ittaikan (feelings of oneness), where feelings are expected to be inferred. However, it is unclear as to how such forms manifest feelings of closeness in the first place. This study opens up these feelings of closeness through exploring the embodied experience and tangible connection in the intimate spaces of the Japanese family. It describes a relational experience of space, depth and touch that is beyond the scope of conventional theories of the body. Drawing on Japanese sociologies of the body as well as other sociological tools that are relevant to everyday Japanese experiences, this study also offers universal contributions to the understandings of how touch can exist as a manifestation of intimacy. The first part of the thesis introduces the reader to the critical concepts and theories driving the study. The key ideas and understandings of Japanese relationships are also considered, leading to the suggestion that a conceptual understanding of embodiment will add to such literature. Part One concludes with a specific investigation of my field research on intimacy in Japan. The second part of the thesis explores how skinship (intimacy through touch) exists and feels in Japanese parent-child and marital relationships. A theory of touch is developed, via Japanese relationships, which is not restricted to physical or visible forms of touch. Described as touching at depth, this theory explores alternative ways of understanding experiences of intimacy that are not necessarily linked to tactile feeling or spatial closeness. Although bodily forms of touch exist in some relationships, other relational states become significant to feelings of connectedness, particularly as the child grows older. The third part of the thesis explores this shift, along with how the Japanese child adapts to the world, when their initial ways of touching no longer exist. Emphasis here is not just on primary 'home&#145; relationships, but also on teacher-child relationships, and the way familial relationships shift as the child moves back and forth between the home and world. It becomes clear in Part Three that touch becomes felt differently as the child grows older and feels their significance and connection with the world in more encompassing ways.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Subjects, objects, and the fetishisms of modernity in the works of Gertrude Stein</field><field name="creator">Livett, Kate, School of English, Media &amp; Performing Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reopens the question of subject/object relations in the works of Gertrude Stein, to argue that the fetishisms theorised by Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, and later Walter Benjamin and Michael Taussig, and problematised by feminist critics such as Elizabeth Grosz, are central to the structure of those relations. My contribution to Stein scholarship is twofold, and is reflected in the division of my thesis into Part One and Part Two.	Part One of this thesis establishes a model for reading the interconnections between subjects and objects in Stein???s work; it identifies a tension between two related yet different structures. The first is a fetishistic relation of subjects to objects, associated by Stein with materiality and nineteenth-century Europe, and the identity categories of the ???genius??? and the ???collector???. The second is a ???new??? figuration of late modernity in which the processual and tacility are central. This latter is associated by Stein with America and the twentieth century, and was a structure that she, along with other modernist artists, was developing. Further, Part One shows how these competing structures of subject/object relations hinge on Stein???s problematic formulations of self, nation, and artistic production.	Part Two uses the model established in Part One to examine the detailed playing-out of the tensions and dilemmas of subject/object relations within several major Stein texts. First considered is the category of the object as it is constructed in Tender Buttons, and second the category of the subject as it is represented in the nexus of those competing structures in The Making of Americans and ???Melanctha???. The readings of Part Two engage with the major strands of Stein criticism of materiality, sexuality, and language in Tender Buttons, Stein???s famous study of objects. The critical areas engaged with in her biggest and most controversial texts respectively ??? The Making of Americans and ???Melanctha??? ??? include typology, ???genius???, and Stein???s methodologies of writing such as repetition/iteration, intersubjectivity, and ???daily living???. This thesis contends that the dilemma of subject/object relations identified and examined in detail is never resolved, indeed, its ongoing reverberations are productive up until and including her final work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stein</field><field name="subject">modernism</field><field name="subject">fetishism</field><field name="subject">subjects</field><field name="subject">objects</field><field name="subject">nation</field><field name="subject">genius</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31931</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of neurotransmitter release mechanisms in dopamine neurons.</field><field name="creator">Daniel, James, St. Vincent Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Medications that treat diseases such as Parkinson???s disease work by regulating dopamine transmission at synapses. Surprisingly, little is known about the mechanisms regulating dopamine release at synapses. In this thesis, we study mechanisms that regulate vesicle recycling in axons and dendrites of dopamine neurons. Key questions we addressed were: (1) Are vesicles in axons and dendrites associated with the same regulatory proteins, and thus by implication the same regulatory mechanisms, as in excitatory neurons; (2) Do vesicles undergo recycling, and (3) if so, are they characterised by a distinct pool size and rate of recycling. To study this, we cultured dopamine neurons and used immunocytochemistry to detect vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) and identify axons, dendrites and synaptic proteins, combined with labelling of recycling vesicles using FM 1-43. Vesicles in axons, but not in dendrites, were associated with presynaptic proteins such as Synaptophysin and Bassoon. We identified two kinds of presynaptic sites in axons: ???synaptic??? (located close to soma and dendrites??? and ???orphan???. The recycling vesicle pool size was smaller at orphan sites than at synaptic sites, and the initial rate of vesicle pool release was also lower at orphan sites. Both synaptic and orphan sites exhibited lower rates of vesicle pool release compared to hippocampal synapses, suggesting functional differences in presynaptic physiology between dopamine neurons and hippocampal neurons. In somatodendritic regions, VMAT2 was localised to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, endosome, and large dense-core vesicles, suggesting that these vesicles might function as a part of the regulated secretory pathway in mediating dopamine release. None of the synaptic vesicle proteins we studied were detected in these regions, although some preliminary evidence of vesicle turnover was detected using FM 1-43 labelling. This thesis provides a detailed analysis of neurotransmitter release mechanisms in dopamine neurons. Our data suggests that presynaptic release of dopamine is mediated by mechanisms similar to those observed in excitatory neurons. In somatodendritic regions, our data suggests that VMAT2 is localised to organelles in secretory pathways, and that distinct mechanisms of release might be present at somatodendritic sites to those present in presynaptic sites. This thesis provides novel methods for analysing vesicle recycling in dopamine neurons, which provides the basis for further studies examining presynaptic function of dopamine neurons in normal brain function, disease, and therapeutic approaches.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neurotransmitters.</field><field name="subject">Dopaminergic neurons - Transplantation.</field><field name="subject">Parkinson???s disease.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31934</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of feedback about errors in learning a complex novel task.</field><field name="creator">Gardner, Dianne, University of New South Wales/Sydney University. AGSM, UNSW</field><field name="description">Two studies were undertaken in order to investigate the effect of different forms of error feedback  and error framing in learning a complex novel task. The experimental task in both studies was a computer-based simulation of a group management situation. After each of the 12 trials, all participants received feedback about their performance on that trial. Participants receiving signal error feedback were also advised as to where they had made errors. Participants receiving diagnostic feedback were told how they could have achieved optimum performance on the previous trial. Learning, performance, strategy, exploration and depth of processing were measured during the task. Self-report measures of self-efficacy, self-set goals, satisfaction and intrinsic motivation were taken after the first six trials and again after all 12 trials were completed. In study 1, detailed diagnostic feedback was associated with better performance than feedback which simply signaled where an error had been made, or feedback that did not identify errors. Diagnostic feedback facilitated the development and use of effective problem-solving strategies and discouraged trial-and-error exploration of the problem space. In this research, exploration was found to be negatively associated with learning and performance. Learners??? self-efficacy moderated the effects of error feedback: learners with high self-efficacy showed high levels of performance regardless of the level of information that the feedback provided but for those with low self-efficacy, detailed diagnostic feedback was essential for the learning process. In the second study, positive error framing (error management) was investigated as a possible means of making signal error feedback more valuable in learning. However while positive error framing was associated with more exploration as expected, it also produced poorer strategies and worse performance than negative error framing (error avoidance instructions). Participants who used good learning strategies instead of exploration performed well despite impoverished feedback. Self-efficacy moderated the impact of error framing: positive error framing helped those with low self-efficacy, but for those with higher self-efficacy it was of more value to encourage error avoidance than error tolerance. The findings show important interactions between error framing, error feedback and learner characteristics.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Feedback (Psychology) .

Firstly, we demonstrate a novel semiconductor-insulator-semiconductor field effect transistor (SISFET), designed specifically to induced 2D hole systems at a ????normal???? AlGaAs-on-GaAs heterojunction. The novel SISFETs feature in our studies of the metallic behavior in 2D systems in which we examine temperature corrections to  ????xx(T) and ????xy(T) in short- and long-range disorder potentials. Next, we shift focus to bilayer hole systems and the many body quantum Hall states that form a nu = 1 in the presence of strong interlayer interactions. We explore the evolution of this quantum Hall state as the relative densities in the layers is imbalanced while the total density is kept constant.  Finally, we demonstrate a novel p-type quantum point contact device that produce the most stable and robust current quantization in a p-type 1D systems to date, allowing us to observed for the first time the 0.7 structure in a p-type device.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Metal insulator transition</field><field name="subject">spontaneous interlayer coherence</field><field name="subject">conductance quantization</field><field name="subject">p-type GaAs</field><field name="subject">microelectronic devices</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bayesian analysis of rainfall-runoff models: insights to parameter estimation, model comparison and hierarchical model development</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Lucy Amanda, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">One challenge that faces hydrologists in water resources planning is to predict the catchment???s response to a given rainfall. Estimation of parameter uncertainty (and model uncertainty) allows assessment of the risk in likely applications of hydrological models. Bayesian statistical inference, with computations carried out via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, offers an attractive approach to model specification, allowing for the combination of any pre-existing knowledge about individual models and their respective parameters with the available catchment data to assess both parameter and model uncertainty. This thesis develops and applies Bayesian statistical tools for parameter estimation, comparison of model performance and hierarchical model aggregation. The work presented has three main sections. The first area of research compares four MCMC algorithms for simplicity, ease of use, efficiency and speed of implementation in the context of conceptual rainfall-runoff modelling. Included is an adaptive Metropolis algorithm that has characteristics that are well suited to hydrological applications. The utility of the proposed adaptive algorithm is further expanded by the second area of research in which a probabilistic regime for comparing selected models is developed and applied. The final area of research introduces a methodology for hydrologic model aggregation that is flexible and dynamic. Rigidity in the model structure limits representation of the variability in the flow generation mechanism, which becomes a limitation when the flow processes are not clearly understood. The proposed Hierarchical Mixtures of Experts (HME) model architecture is designed to do away with this limitation by selecting individual models probabilistically based on predefined catchment indicators. In addition, the approach allows a more flexible specification of the model error to better assess the risk of likely outcomes based on the model simulations. Application of the approach to lumped and distributed rainfall runoff models for a variety of catchments shows that by assessing different catchment predictors the method can be a useful tool for prediction of catchment response.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrology</field><field name="subject">rainfall runoff model</field><field name="subject">Bayesian</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electron correlations in mesoscopic systems.</field><field name="creator">Sloggett, Clare, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with electron correlation effects within low-dimensional, mesoscopic systems. We study phenomena within two different types of system in which correlations play an important role. The first involves the spectra and spin structure of small symmetric quantum dots, or &amp;quoteartificial atoms&amp;quote. The second is the &amp;quote0.7 structure&amp;quote, a well-known but mysterious anomalous conductance plateau which occurs in the conductance profile of a quantum point contact.  Artificial atoms are manufactured mesoscopic devices: quantum dots which resemble real atoms in that their symmetry gives them a &amp;quoteshell structure&amp;quote. We examine two-dimensional circular artificial atoms numerically, using restricted and unrestricted Hartree-Fock simulation. We go beyond the mean-field approximation by direct calculation of second-order correlation terms; a method which works well for real atoms but to our knowledge has not been used before for quantum dots. We examine the spectra and spin structure of such dots and find, contrary to previous theoretical mean-field studies, that Hund's rule is not followed. We also find, in agreement with previous numerical studies, that the shell structure is fragile with respect to a simple elliptical deformation.  The 0.7 structure appears in the conductance of a quantum point contact. The conductance through a ballistic quantum point contact is quantised in units of 2e^2/h. On the lowest conductance step, an anomalous narrow conductance plateau at about G = 0.7 x 2e^2/h is known to exist, which cannot be explained in the non-interacting picture. Based on suggestive numerical results, we model conductance through the lowest channel of a quantum point contact analytically. The model is based on the screening of the electron-electron interaction outside the QPC, and our observation that the wavefunctions at the Fermi level are peaked within the QPC. We use a kinetic equation approach, with perturbative account of electron-electron backscattering, to demonstrate that these simple features lead to the existence of a 0.7-like structure in the conductance. The behaviour of this structure reproduces experimentally observed features of the 0.7 structure, including the temperature dependence and the behaviour under applied in-plane magnetic fields.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quantum dots.</field><field name="subject">Quantum point contacts.</field><field name="subject">Mesoscopics.</field><field name="subject">Conductance.</field><field name="subject">Correlations.</field><field name="subject">Electron configuration.</field><field name="subject">Mesoscopic phenomena (Physics)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31875</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitric oxide and tendon healing</field><field name="creator">Murrell, George Anthony Calvert, St George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Nitric oxide is a small free radical generated by family of enzymes, the nitric oxide synthases. In a series of experiments performed over the last 15 years we showed that nitric oxide is induced by all three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase during tendon healing and that it plays a crucial beneficial role in restoring tendon function.  In normal tendon we found very little nitric oxide synthase activity while in injured rat and human tendons nitric oxide synthase activity was expressed in healing fibroblasts in a temporal fashion. In healing rat Achilles tendon fibroblasts the first isoform to be expressed was endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), followed by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and then brain or neuronal nitric oxide synthase (bNOS).  Systemic inhibition of nitric oxide synthase activity decreased the cross sectional area and mechanical properties of the healing rodent Achilles tendons. Addition of nitric oxide via NO-flurbiprofen or NO-paracetamol enhanced rat Achilles tendon healing. Addition of nitric oxide to cultured human tendon cells via chemical means and via adenoviral transfection enhanced collagen synthesis, suggesting that one mechanism for the beneficial of nitric oxide on tendon healing might be via matrix synthesis. The final part of the work involved three randomized, double-blind clinical trials which evaluated the efficacy of nitric oxide donation via a patch in the management of the tendinopathy. In all three clinical trials there was a significant positive beneficial effect of nitric oxide donation to the clinical symptoms and function of patients with Achilles tendinopathy, tennis elbow and Achilles tendonitis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nitric oxide</field><field name="subject">tendon healing</field><field name="subject">free radical</field><field name="subject">sports injuries</field><field name="subject">orthopaedic surgery</field><field name="subject">tendons -- wounds and injuries -- treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31887</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inscribing the architect :the depiction of the attributes of the architect in frontispieces to sixteenth century Italian architectural treatises</field><field name="creator">Luscombe, Desley, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study investigates the changing understanding of the role of the ???architect??? in Italy during the sixteenth century by examining frontispieces to published architectural treatises.  From analysis of these illustrations four attributes emerge as important to new societal understandings of the role of ???architect.???  The first attribute is the desire to delineate the boundaries of knowledge for architecture as a discipline, relevant to sixteenth-century society.  The second is the depiction of the ???architect,??? as an intellectual engaged in the resolution of practical, political, economic and philosophical considerations of his practice.  The third represents the ???architect??? having a specific domain of activity in the design of civic spaces of magnificence not only for patrons but also for the city per se.  The fourth represents the ???architect??? and society as perceiving a commonality of an architectural role beyond the boundary of individual locations and patrons.  Five treatises meet the criteria set for this study: Sebastiano Serlio???s Regole generali di architetura sopra le Cinque maniere de gli edifici cio??, Toscano, Dorico, Ionico, Corinthio, et Composito, con gli essempi dell???antiquita, che, per la magior parte concordano con la dottrina di Vitruvio, 1537, his, Il Terzo libro nel qual si figurano, e descrivono le antichita di Roma, 1540, Cosimo Bartoli???s translation of Alberti???s De re aedificatoria titled L???architettura di Leonbattista Alberti, tradotta in lingua fiorentina da Cossimo Bartoli, Gentilhuomo, &amp; Academico Fiorentino, 1550; Daniele Barbaro???s translation and commentary on Vitruvius???

A second aim for the study was to review the usefulness of frontispieces as an historical archive.  It was found that frontispieces visually structure important ideas by providing a narrative with meaning as an integral part of the illustration.

Treatment options include surgery and highly focused radiation (stereotactic radiosurgery).  For large and deep seated lesions, the risks of surgery may be prohibitively high, while radiosurgery has a disappointingly low efficacy and long latency.  Radiosurgery carries the most promise for significant advances, however the process by which radiosurgery achieves obliteration is incompletely understood.  Inflammation and thrombosis are likely to be important in the radiation response and may be amenable to pharmacological manipulation to improve radiosurgical efficacy. Materials and methods Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy were used to study normal cerebral vessels, cavernous malformations and AVMs, some of which had previously been irradiated.  An attempt was made to culture AVM endothelial cells to study the immediate response of AVM endothelium to radiosurgery.  The effects of radiosurgery in a rat model of AVM were studied using immunohistochemistry and the results used to determine the choice of a pharmacological strategy to enhance the thrombotic effects of radiosurgery. Results Vascular malformations have a different endothelial inflammatory phenotype than normal cerebral vessels.  Radiosurgery may cause long term changes in inflammatory molecule expression and leads to endothelial loss with exposure of pro-thrombotic molecules.  Ultrastructural effects of irradiation include widespread cell loss, smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and thrombosis.  Endothelial culture from AVMs proved difficult due to SMC predominance in initial cultures. Radiosurgery upregulated several endothelial inflammatory molecules in the animal model and may induce pro-thrombotic cell membrane alterations.  The administration of lipopolysaccharide and soluble tissue factor to rats following radiosurgery led to selective thrombosis of irradiated vessels. Conclusions Inflammation and thrombosis are important in the radiosurgical response of AVMs.  Lumen obliteration appears to be mediated by proliferation of cells within the vessel wall and thrombosis. Upregulation of inflammatory molecules and perhaps disruption of the normal phospholipid asymmetry of the endothelial and SMC membranes are some of the earliest responses to radiosurgery.  The alterations induced by radiation may be harnessed to selectively initiate thrombus formation.  Stimulation of thrombosis may improve the efficacy of radiosurgery, increasing treatable lesion size and reducing latency.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cerebral arteriovenous malformations.

In keeping with a cultural studies approach, and a commitment to social action, emphasis is placed upon enhancing the ability of State museums to fulfil obligations and expectations imposed upon them as modern collecting institutions in a culturally diverse nation. By relating the desirability and ability of State museums to attaining social justice in a multicultural Australia through broadening the concept of Australia???s heritage, the thesis is firmly situated within post-colonial discourse.  The thesis analyses State multicultural, heritage, and museum legislation, in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, with regard to State museums as agents of cultural policy. Results from a survey, Greeks and Museums, conducted amongst Australia???s Greeks in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, reveal an anomaly between their museum-going habits and the perception of those habits as expressed by government policies promoting the inclusion of Australians of a non-English speaking background in the nation???s cultural programmes. In exploring the issue of inclusiveness, the thesis highlights the need for cultural institutions to shift the emphasis away from audience development, towards greater audience participation. The thesis outlines an initiative-derived Queensland Model for establishing an inclusive relationship between museums and communities, resulting in permanent, affordable, and authoritative collections, while simultaneously improving the museums??? international reputation and networking capabilities.  By using the example of one of the nation???s non-indigenous communities, and drawing upon material obtained through the survey, and a catalogue containing photographs and lists of Greek textile collections found in the Powerhouse Museum (MAAS), Sydney, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Immigration Museum, Melbourne, the Queensland Art Gallery and the Queensland Museum, Brisbane, as well as collections owned by private individuals, the thesis focuses on the role played by museums in constructing social cohesion and inclusiveness.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">museums</field><field name="subject">cultural diversity</field><field name="subject">multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">heritage</field><field name="subject">Greek textiles</field><field name="subject">cultural policy.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling dependent risks for insurer risk management: experimental studies with copulas</field><field name="creator">Wu, Mei Lan, Actuarial Studies, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The increase in the use of copulas has introduced implementation issues for both practitioners and researchers. One of the issues is to obtain a copula function for a given set of data. The most common approaches for the estimation of the parameters of the copula functions have been the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and the Inference Functions for Margins (IFM) methods. Archimedean copulas are one of the most important classes of copulas that are widely used in both finance and insurance for modelling dependent risks. However, simulating multivariate Archimedean copulas has always been a difficult task as the number of dimensions increases. The assessment of capital requirements has always been an important application of stochastic modelling. Capital requirements can vary significantly depending on the model adopted. Several professional bodies have recently discussed the concept of dependencies between insurance risks. They suggest that insurers should use a technique based on copulas to describe the dependence of risks within an insurance company in the context of solvency assessment. The first contribution of this thesis is to provide an insight into the efficiency of parameter estimation methods. This thesis uses numerical experiments to assess the performance of the two common approaches. The second contribution of this thesis is to present a new algorithm to simulate multivariate Exchangeable Archimedean copulas. This algorithm provides a practical solution for simulating one-parameter multivariate Archimedean copulas. Numerical experiments are used to apply this algorithm to determine the "additional" economic capital for an insurance company with multiple lines of business that wants to expand its business by adding another line of business and where the businesses are dependent. The third contribution of this thesis is to quantify the impact of the choice of copulas on the solvency measure of a general insurer within a Dynamic Financial Analysis modelling framework. The results of our experiments provide important guidance for the capital assessment for general insurers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dependence modelling.</field><field name="subject">Copulas.</field><field name="subject">Risk (Insurance)</field><field name="subject">Insurance -- Mathematics.</field><field name="subject">Risk management.</field><field name="subject">Risk (Insurance) -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wettability of solid metals by low melting non-metallic inclusions</field><field name="creator">Parry, Gavin Wayne, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A project studied wetting of iron, nickel and platinum by molten MnO-SiO2 (MS) and CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 (CAS) slags of eutectic composition to contribute to understanding of wetting behaviour of solid metal-molten oxide systems relevant to steelmaking.  Novel results of dynamic wetting behaviour by the sessile drop method were obtained under strongly reducing atmosphere (oxygen partial pressure 10-20 -- 10-18 atm).  Terminal contact angles (after 240 min) for MS slag were: for iron substrates -5??2??(1350??C), 9+-2??

Values for interfacial tension, work of adhesion, spreading parameter (S) and interaction coefficient (&#1060;) were also determined. Work of adhesion for all three substrates with MS slag changed in a very narrow range 910 - 930 mJ/m2. Interfacial tension with this slag was 1,480 mN/m for Ni at 1350-1390??C, and 1,880-1,890 mN/m for Pt in the temperature range 1,350-1,450??C. For iron, interfacial tension was 1,720 mN/m at 1350??C (&#947;-Fe); it decreased to 1590-1580 mN/m with increasing temperature to 1390 and 1450??C (&#61540;-Fe).  Lower work of adhesion and higher interfacial tension was found for metals with CAS slag.  Wetting properties of Pt substrate with MS slag were close to that with CAS slag, while Fe and Ni substrates showed better wetting by MS slag in comparison with CAS slag. This was attributed to higher reactivity of Fe and Ni with MS slag, particularly reduction of MnO. Although MnO was also reduced in reaction with Pt, oxygen adsorption in contact with both slags was a major factor governing wettability of Pt.  Dissolution of manganese in nickel and platinum substrates at elevated temperatures modified the interface chemistry, causing formation of a liquid alloy phase. Degree of silica reduction from MS slag was much smaller in comparison with MnO reduction (negligible for Pt); it was very minor from CAS slag. Concentration profiles of Mn and Si across the interface and along the metal surface were used to estimate diffusion coefficients. Diffusion along metal surfaces was generally higher by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude than across the interface.  Reduction of oxides and adsorption of oxygen modify the metal-oxide interface, making wetting dynamic. They have a profound on interfacial properties.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wettability.</field><field name="subject">Wetting.</field><field name="subject">Nickel.</field><field name="subject">Platinum.</field><field name="subject">Manganese silicate.</field><field name="subject">Calcium aluminosilicate.</field><field name="subject">Surface tension.</field><field name="subject">Surface chemistry.</field><field name="subject">Adhesion.</field><field name="subject">Contact angle.</field><field name="subject">Steel -- Inclusions.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40891</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Object validity and effects</field><field name="creator">Lu, Yi, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The object-oriented community is paying increasing attention to techniques for object instance encapsulation and alias protection. Formal techniques for modular verification of programs at the level of objects are being developed hand in hand with type systems and static analysis techniques for restricting the structure of runtime object graphs. Ownership type systems have provided a sound basis for such structural restrictions by being able to statically represent an extensible object ownership hierarchy. However, such structural restrictions may potentially have limitations on cases when more flexible reference structures are desired.  In this thesis, we present a different encapsulation technique, called Effect Encapsulation, which confines side effects rather than object references. With relaxed restriction on reference structure, it is able to express certain common object-oriented patterns which cannot be expressed in Ownership Types. From this basis, we also describe a model of Object Validity --- a framework for reasoning about object invariants. Such a framework can track the effect and dependency of method calls on object invariants within an ownership-based type system, even in the presence of re-entrant calls. Moreover, we present an access control technique for protecting object instances. Combined with context variance, the resulting type system allows for a more flexible and useful access control policy, hence is capable of expressing more object-oriented patterns.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Programming languages</field><field name="subject">Object-oriented</field><field name="subject">Object invariants</field><field name="subject">Type and effect systems</field><field name="subject">Object-oriented programming (Computer science)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Caching dynamic data for web applications</field><field name="creator">Mahdavi, Mehregan, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Web portals are one of the rapidly growing applications, providing a single interface to access different sources (providers). The results from the providers are typically obtained by each provider querying a database and returning an HTML or XML document. Performance and in particular providing fast response time is one of the critical issues in such applications. Dissatisfaction of users dramatically increases with increasing response time, resulting in abandonment of Web sites, which in turn could result in loss of revenue by the providers and the portal. Caching is one of the key techniques that address the performance of such applications. In this work we focus on improving the performance of portal applications via caching. We discuss the limitations of existing caching solutions in such applications and introduce a caching strategy based on collaboration between the portal and its providers. Providers trace their logs, extract information to identify good candidates for caching and notify the portal. Caching at the portal is decided based on scores calculated by providers and associated with objects. We evaluate the performance of the collaborative caching strategy using simulation data. We show how providers can trace their logs and calculate cache-worthiness scores for their objects and notify the portal. We also address the issue of heterogeneous scoring policies by different providers and introduce mechanisms to regulate caching scores. We also show how portal and providers can synchronize their meta-data in order to minimize the overhead associated with collaboration for caching.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Web Caching</field><field name="subject">Caching Dynamic Data</field><field name="subject">Web Portal</field><field name="subject">Dynamic Content</field><field name="subject">Collaborative Caching</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the early interactions between vaccinia virus and dendritic cells - towards an enhanced vaccine vector.</field><field name="creator">Dunstan, Kerrie, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the post smallpox era, vaccinia virus (VACV) has emerged as an important candidate vaccine vector. As yet, the binding receptors and entry mechanisms utilised by the two infectious forms, IMV and EEV, in dendritic cells (DCs) are unknown. We have investigated the interactions between VACV and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) that are known to be utilised by many other viruses for binding and entry in DCs. Using a variety of CLR ligands and inhibitors we were unable to inhibit IMV or EEV binding to MDDCs and we conclude that they do not bind to CLRs. We have also investigated VACV entry in MDDCs and show that both IMV and EEV enter MDDCs via an endocytic pathway. Using a variety of drugs that inhibit cellular processes we found IMV and EEV entry to be actin- and calcium-dependent. EEV entry was also cholesterol- and energy-dependent, whereas IMV entry was only partially dependent on these factors. Both IMV and EEV colocalised with endolysosomal markers. This data suggests that EEV may enter DCs via caveolin-mediated endocytosis whereas IMV entry can occur via multiple complementary mechanisms, including endocytosis and fusion. Macropinocytosis may also constitute a minor route of entry for IMV as entry was partially inhibited by dimethyl amiloride and the virus colocalised with dextran. Finally we have provided a comprehensive flow cytometric analysis of Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression at the protein level in MDDCs and monocyte-derived Langerhans cells (MDLCs) as models for different myeloid DC subsets. We found TLR expression to be cell type-specific and MDDCs expressed the full repertoire of TLRs 1-9, including small amounts of TLR8 and TLR9 on the cell surface. The expression of these TLRs that recognise nucleic acids on the surface of cells may constitute an early warning system for signalling the presence of viral invaders that would normally subvert the function of DCs. We also found TLR expression in mature cells to be dependent on the nature of the maturation stimulus (lipopolysaccharide versus cytokine/prostaglandin cocktail) and VACV infection induced profound down-regulation of all TLRs. These findings will have important implications for the rational design of VACV-vectored vaccines.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vaccinia virus.</field><field name="subject">Dendritic cells.</field><field name="subject">C-type lectin receptors.</field><field name="subject">Endocytosis.</field><field name="subject">Toll-like receptors.</field><field name="subject">Vaccines.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving broadcast performance in multi-radio multi-channel multi-rate wireless mesh networks.</field><field name="creator">Qadir, Junaid, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the problem of `efficient' broadcast in a multi-radio multi-channel multi-rate wireless mesh network (MR$^2$-MC WMN). In such a MR$^2$-MC WMN, nodes are equipped with multiple radio network interface cards, each tuned to an orthogonal channel, that can dynamically adjust transmission rate by choosing a modulation scheme appropriate for the channel conditions. We choose `broadcast latency', defined as the maximum delay between a packet's network-wide broadcast at the source and its eventual reception at all network nodes, as the `efficiency' metric of broadcast performance. The problem of constructing a broadcast forwarding structure having minimal broadcast latency is referred to as the `minimum-latency-broadcasting' (MLB) problem.  While previous research for broadcast in single-radio single-rate wireless networks has highlighted the wireless medium's `\emph{wireless broadcast advantage}' (WBA); little is known regarding how the new features of MR$^2$-MC WMN may be exploited. We study in this thesis how the availability of multiple radio interfaces (tuned to orthogonal channels) at WMN nodes, and WMN's multi-rate transmission capability and WBA, might be exploited to improve the `broadcast latency' performance. We show the MLB problem for MR$^2$-MC WMN to be NP-hard, and resort to heuristics for its solution. We divide the overall problem into two sub-problems, which we address in two separate parts of this thesis. \emph{In the first part of this thesis}, the MLB problem is defined for the case of single-radio single-channel multi-rate WMNs  where WMN nodes are equipped with a single radio tuned to a common channel. \emph{In the second part of this thesis}, the MLB problem is defined for MR$^2$-MC WMNs where WMN nodes are equipped with multiple radios tuned to multiple orthogonal channels. We demonstrate that broadcasting in multi-rate WMNs is significantly different to broadcasting in single-rate WMNs, and that broadcast performance in multi-rate WMNs can be significantly improved by exploiting the availability of multi-rate feature and multiple interfaces. We also present two alternative MLB broadcast frameworks and specific algorithms, centralized and distributed, for each framework that can exploit multiple interfaces at a WMN node, and the multi-rate feature and WBA of MR$^2$-MC WMN to return improved `broadcast latency' performance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">broadcasting</field><field name="subject">routing</field><field name="subject">multi-radio</field><field name="subject">multi-channel</field><field name="subject">multi-rate</field><field name="subject">wireless mesh networks</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41214</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Audio compression and speech enhancement using temporal masking models</field><field name="creator">Gunawan, Teddy Surya, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Of the few existing models of temporal masking applicable to problems such as compression and enhancement, none are based on empirical data from the psychoacoustic literature, presumably because the multidimensional nature of the data makes the derivation of tractable functional models difficult. This thesis presents two new functional models of the temporal masking effect of the human auditory system, and their exploitation in audio compression and speech enhancement applications. Traditional audio compression algorithms do not completely utilise the temporal masking properties of the human auditory system, relying solely on simultaneous masking models. A perceptual wavelet packet-based audio coder has been devised that incorporates the first developed temporal masking model and combined with simultaneous masking models in a novel manner. An evaluation of the coder using both objective (PEAQ, ITU-R BS.1387) and extensive subjective tests (ITU-R BS.1116) revealed a bitrate reduction of more than 17% compared with existing simultaneous masking-based audio coders, while preserving transparent quality. In addition, the oversampled wavelet packet transform (ODWT) has been newly applied to obtain alias-free coefficients for more accurate masking threshold calculation. Finally, a low-complexity scalable audio coding algorithm using the ODWT-based thresholds and temporal masking has been investigated. Currently, there is a strong need for innovative speech enhancement algorithms exploiting the auditory masking effects of human auditory system that perform well at very low signal-to-noise ratio. Existing competitive noise suppression algorithms and those that incorporate simultaneous masking were examined and evaluated for their suitability as baseline algorithms. Objective measures using PESQ (ITU-T P.862) and subjective measures (ITU-T P.835) demonstrate that the proposed enhancement scheme, based on a second new masking model, outperformed the seven baseline speech enhancement methods by at least 6- 20% depending on the SNR. Hence, the proposed speech enhancement scheme exploiting temporal masking effects has good potential across many types and intensities of environmental noise.

He has received lots of criticism both during his lifetime and ever since. Even nowadays, though many of his piano exercises are popular items for many teachers and pupils ranging from beginners to virtuosi, Czerny is still rated as a master of mechanical works that focus mainly on the right hand. This study will argue that Czerny is much underrated, particularly as a pedagogue, and aims to find out what are the underlying principles that Czerny embedded in his piano pedagogical works, what made them indispensable in the teaching of piano playing and to what degree they present other musical elements which are not purely mechanical in order to reassess Czerny?s achievements in the field of piano pedagogy. The discussion is based on the original English edition of Czerny?s Opus 500 Complete Theoretical and Practical Piano Forte School (1839), its Supplement, as well as Czerny?s other pedagogical works, such as Op. 139, Op. 299, Op. 365, Op. 755 and Op. 821. In addition, other selected pedagogical works and representative keyboard method books and exercises (excluding works for the organ) by other authors up to Czerny?s time are discussed for enriching the discussion. Through a detailed analysis of Czerny?s Opus 500, this study identifies fifteen parameters in his teaching sequences that range from beginner to virtuoso and the findings are clarified and contextualized within the field of 19th century piano pedagogy. These fifteen parameters are also exemplified in four selected opuses of Czerny, and through the ?Exam Pieces? of The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. These are used to justify the applicability of the parameters in the learning sequences intrinsic to the graded piano qualifying examinations nowadays. It is argued that in view of the rich pedagogical content of Czerny?s work both technically and stylistically, together with the systematic teaching sequences that he presented in his piano pedagogical works, Czerny?s contribution to the art of keyboard playing should be well acknowledged.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Czerny, Carl, 1791-1857</field><field name="subject">Piano -- Instruction and study -- History and criticism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology and extinction of Southeast Asia&#146;s Megafauna</field><field name="creator">Louys, Julien, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Quaternary megafauna of Southeast Asia are among the world&#146;s poorest known. Throughout the Pleistocene, continental collisions, active volcanic systems and fluctuations in sea level have had dramatic effects on the region's geography, from southern China to Indonesia. Many Southeast Asian megafauna experienced geographical range reduction or complete extinction during that interval. This thesis explores the relative influence of environmental change and human interaction in these extinctions. There is currently no direct evidence to suggest that humans had a negative impact on Southeast Asian megafauna until the Holocene. Rather, extinctions and geographical range reduction experienced by megafauna are likely to have resulted from of loss of suitable habitats, in particular the loss of more open habitats. Environmental change throughout the Pleistocene of Southeast Asia is reconstructed on the basis of discriminant functions analysis of megafauna from twenty-seven Southeast Asian Quaternary sites, as well as Gongwangling, an early Pleistocene hominin site previously interpreted as paleoarctic. The discriminant functions were defined on the basis of species lists drawn from modern Asian nature reserves and national parks, and were analysed using both taxonomic and phylogeny-free variables. Biases present in these species lists were mitigated against using a range of multivariate techniques. The reconstructions show that Pleistocene environments in Southeast Asia varied from open (e.g. savannah), mixed (woodland) and closed (e.g. rainforest) habitats. Changes in habitats through time are likely to have been driven, at least in part, by changes in sea-level, in turn related to oscillations between glacial and interglacial conditions. The environmental changes associated with these oscillations are likely to have adversely affected many of Southeast Asia&#146;s megafauna. The Toba super-eruption (~74kya) is unlikely to have been responsible for any of the megafauna extinctions of the Late Pleistocene.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">There's always more: the art of David McDiarmid</field><field name="creator">Gray, Sally Suzette Clelland, School of Art History &amp; Theory, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that the work of the artist David McDiarmid is to be read as an enactment of late twentieth century gay male and queer politics.

An attempt has been made to address some issues of the laser scan matching for global self-localization and map building. Different methods for the interpretation of sensor information have been investigated. Mobile robots have many applications in transportation, surveillance, health care and mining etc. For a successful navigation, the representation of the environment is crucial. The robot environment interaction is very complex in practice. Many factors contribute to this complexity, such as the electromechanical hardware structure and complex controlling and navigational programming modules. Above all however, it is the environment itself which is usually very complex. The perception model is the most important component of the navigation system of a mobile robot, at the core of which is the representation of the environment. Environment parameters are difficult to model and simplistic models are used in various position estimation techniques. However, for true autonomous navigation, the environment should be represented in a more dense fashion and the interpretation should be straightforward. The robot interacts with its environment using sensors. The sensory information provides clues about the location of the robot but the interpretion of this information is very challenging. Some type of model or a mathematical description of the environment is required for any meaningful interpretation and for making critical navigational decisions when a new observation arrives. The second key component of a navigation system is a motion model. Due to structural and software complexity the behaviour of a robot is rarely repeatable under the same motion commands. This can be attributed to many factors such as slippage, wear and tear of wheels at different rates, floor conditions or obstacle negotiation strategies. This means that motion commands have an associated uncertainty and need statistical treatment. Similarly the processing of raw laser data, although highly desirable, is computationally very expensive and therefore we usually need to make a trade off and extract some features from this data, despite losing some of the information. In this thesis we investigated three core issues of motion modelling, perception (or observation) modelling and scan correlation. Some auxiliary issues have also been addressed, such as the extraction of features from laser data and a broader classification of the environment suitable for certain situations. In regard to environment representation, we used the geometrical form of representation and tried to extract some statistical formulation. This method suggests to capture the environment model in a statistical form before the start of navigation when the map is known. The detailed parametric representation of the environment is obtained along with a proposal for a laser scan matching method based on geometrical line and corner features. The geometrical representation is based on some features extracted from raw laser data. This is considered a compact and easily implementable form, which was one of the objectives of our research, however utilisation of all the sensory information is still desirable and we have also investigated this issue. The models have been tested thoroughly on simulations and with real data in laboratory and office-like indoor environments. Laser scan matching is a technique of position estimation based on matching two laser scans taken at the initial and final positions of the robot. We also presented a method to find out the degree of match between two laser scans. At the end of the thesis, the scan correlation has been used to find the most reliable landmarks in the environment. This approach filters out the nuisance landmarks which increase the size of matrices in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping algorithms. An improved computational efficiency was of primary concern and a main focus of this research. All the methods proposed in this thesis, such as feature extraction, broader classification, parametric formulation, line segment based scan matching and the scan matching for measurement updates address the computational issues in a fundamental way by using an appropriate formulation of the problem.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance and safety of centrifugal chillers using hydrocarbons.</field><field name="creator">Tadros, Amir, The University of New South Wales. School of Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The high ozone depletion and global warming potentials of fluorocarbon refrigerants have resulted in prohibitions and restrictions in many markets. Hydrocarbon refrigerants have low environmental impacts and are successfully used in domestic refrigerators and car air conditioners but replacing fluorocarbons in centrifugal chillers for air conditioning applications is unknown. Hydrocarbon replacements need a heat transfer correlation for refrigerant in flooded evaporators and predictions for operating conditions, capacity and performance. Safety precautions for large quantities of hydrocarbon refrigerants are needed and control of overpressure in plantrooms requires accurate prediction.  Reliable correlations exist for forced convection in a single phase flow, condensation outside tubes and evaporation off sprayed tubes. For flooded evaporators this thesis proposes a new correlation for forced convection boiling of any refrigerant. An enhancement factor is combined with a modified Chen coefficient using recent pool boiling and forced convection correlations outside tubes. This correlates within typically a factor of two to known boiling literature measurements for CFC-113, CFC-11, HCFC-123, HFC-134a and HC-601.  The operating conditions, capacity and performance of replacement hydrocarbons in centrifugal chillers were predicted using fluorocarbon performance as a model. With the new heat transfer correlation hydrocarbon predictions for flooded evaporators were made. For any fluorocarbon refrigerant there exists a replacement mixture of hydrocarbons which with a rotor speed increase about 40% gives the same cooling capacity in the same centrifugal chiller under the same operating conditions. For example replacing HCFC-123 in a flooded evaporator with HC-601/602 [90.4/9.6] and increasing the rotor speed by 43% will increase the coefficient of performance by 4.5% at the same cooling capacity.  The maximum plantroom overpressure considered was from leakage and ignition of a uniform air/refrigerant mixture with maximum laminar burning velocity. Flow was modelled using a turbulence viscosity due to Launder and Spalding and turbulent deflagration using a reaction progress variable after Zimont. These partial differential equations were solved approximately for two and three dimensional geometries using finite volume methods from the Fluent program suite. Simple overpressure predictions from maximum flame area approximations agreed with Fluent results within 13.7% promising safe plantroom design without months of computer calculation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">refrigeration</field><field name="subject">refrigerant replacements</field><field name="subject">hydrocarbons</field><field name="subject">centrifugal chiller</field><field name="subject">flooded evaporator</field><field name="subject">forced convection boiling</field><field name="subject">safety</field><field name="subject">overpressure in plantrooms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Environmental Challenge to the Overloaded State: The Politics of Toxic Chemicals in NSW since the late 1970s</field><field name="creator">Benn, Suzanne Harriette, Science &amp; Technology Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a regional interdisciplinary analysis of the environmental challenge to the liberal democratic state.  It situates these new problems of governance in one of the dominating political conflicts of our time, the battle between market and state for the 'commanding heights'.  By the end of the 1970s, environmental concerns had added to the social crises associated with the overloaded, welfare state.  The study sets the political context through an exposition of the perceived problems of the overloaded state, analysed by neo-Marxist theorists in terms of rationality and legitimacy deficits and by public choice theorists in terms of the incentives and calculations confronting rational individuals.  It draws out the association between these alternative perspectives on 'state overload'  and the political philosophies of corporatism and neo-liberalism, showing that, on the neo-Marxist understanding, corporatism addresses the functional requirements of late capitalism, while public choice precepts are strongly influential on leading elements of neo-liberalism.  This political analysis is developed through the history of a landmark piece of legislation, the Environmentally Hazardous Chemicals Act (NSW) 1985, in toxic chemicals policymaking from the late 1970s to the end of 1997.  The interpretation of the case material shows that the response in NSW to the environmental problematic has been driven by the reform agenda of the successive political programs of corporatism and neo-liberalism for the state, the bureaucracy and the democratic process. Neither the corporatist nor the neo-liberal programs succeeded in meeting environmental criteria.  Examination of the inadequate responses of both corporatism and neo-liberalism, when measured against sustainability criteria, leads to a deeper understanding of the institutional reforms required if these criteria are to be addressed.  The thesis concludes that the failure to effect successful reform of toxic chemicals policy in NSW reflects the failure of leading political theorems of the liberal democratic state to incorporate sustainability criteria successfully into their reform agenda for the state, the bureaucracy and the democratic process.  These regional issues are shown to be thematic for the nation-state when raised in the context of the globalisation of the environmental challenge and the inter  nationalisation of market forces.  The thesis concludes with a brief review of some recent political theory in relation to the programmatic issues of sustainability and democracy which it has pursued.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hazardous chemicals</field><field name="subject">environmental challenge</field><field name="subject">politics of toxic chemicals</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors Affecting Faculty Morale in Seventh-day Adventist Tertiary Institutions</field><field name="creator">Tagai, Kuresa, School of Education Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">Using a multimethod approach, this study set out to examine the concept of faculty morale - what it is, what affects it, and how to improve it - in the setting of the four South Pacific tertiary institutions owned and run by the Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) Church. Based on three research questions and three major expectations, the study, done between October 1997 and March 1998, was carried out in two stages representing the two models of research - quantitative and qualitative. The study confirmed the multi-faceted and complex nature of morale as well as the close relationship between this concept and that of job satisfaction. While faculty morale appeared better in some institutions than others, the data reported in this study indicate that faculty morale overall seemed to have suffered due to a variety of factors. Most notable among these was the perceived leadership style of senior administrators as manifested through a range of activities and attitudes comprising their willingness or otherwise to share power with the faculty, to follow a satisfactory process of consultation, to allow adequate academic freedom, to promote faculty participation and representation in institutional policy- and decision-making, and to communicate openly with academic staff. Faculty satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the above and other aspects of their senior administrators' leadership style, along with their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with other aspects of their work, were the principal factors linked to faculty morale. The surprising absence of a significant relationship between faculty morale and a religious-oriented commitment among SDA faculty members suggests that religious commitment and morale may, to a large extent, operate independently of each other. Although religious commitment was shown to be very solid among SDA faculty members, the study indicates that this type of commitment has its limits and may be unrelated to commitment to a particular institution. Implications of these findings were drawn out for administrators of the SDA Church in the South Pacific and the on-site administrators and faculty at each of the four institutions studied. The study also contributed to the theoretical understanding of the concept of morale and proposed areas for further research.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Seventh day Adventist universities and colleges Oceania</field><field name="subject">Seventh Day Adventists Education Oceania</field><field name="subject">Teacher morale Oceania</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32663</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MECHANISMS OF STEROID-INDUCED HYPERTENSION IN MAN AND RAT</field><field name="creator">Mangos, George Jack, St. George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Models of steroid-induced hypertension in man and rat have been well characterized but the mechanisms by which ACTH and glucocorticoids raise blood pressure are not fully understood. Recently described paracrine (eg endothelial nitric oxide) and humoral (eg PHF) factors may be important in human essential hypertension. These factors were examined in cortisol-induced hypertension in man and ACTH-induced hypertension in the rat respectively. In man, the haemodynamic effects of ACTH can be attributed to the adrenal production of cortisol, but whether the major rodent glucocorticoid corticosterone is responsible for ACTH-induced hypertension in the rat has not been resolved. This question was examined in these studies.  In male volunteers, exogenous cortisol raised blood pressure and suppressed endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, by a mechanism which may be nitric oxide synthase dependent. Although dexamethasone and fludrocortisone also raised blood pressure, attenuation of cholinergic vasodilatation was not observed. From these studies, the data suggest that the effect of cortisol on endothelium-dependent vasodilatation is unique to the endogenous hormone and not reproduced by synthetic agonists of GR or MR. Impaired endothelial vasodilator function may contribute to cortisol-induced hypertension in man.  In the rat, exogenous corticosterone, administered in doses to achieve circulating concentrations similar to those observed in the experimental model of ACTH excess, reproduced the haemodynamic and some of the metabolic changes which characterize ACTH-induced hypertension. Further, like ACTH-induced hypertension, corticosterone-induced hypertension was prevented by L- but not D-arginine, and this effect was completely prevented by NOLA. It is likely that adrenal corticosterone mediates the hypertensive effects of ACTH excess.  Parathyroidectomy had no significant effect on the rise in blood pressure secondary to ACTH excess. It is unlikely that PHF contributes to the model of ACTH-induced hypertension in the rat. The bioassay for the measurement of PHF could not be reproduced in our laboratory, leaving a question mark about the relevance of this putative factor in hypertension research.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">STEROID-INDUCED HYPERTENSION</field><field name="subject">HYPERTENTION</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantum Phenomena in Strongly Correlated Electrons Systems</field><field name="creator">Shevchenko, Pavel, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Quantum phenomena in high-Tc superconductors and dimerized quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnets  are studied analytically in this thesis. The implications of the Fermi surface consisting of the disjoint pieces, observed  in cuprate superconductors,  are considered. It is demonstrated that in this case the g-wave superconducting pairing is closely related to  d-wave pairing. The superconductivity in this system can be described in terms of two almost degenerate superconducting condensates. As a result a new spatial scale lg, much larger than the superconducting correlation length x, arises and a new collective excitation corresponding to the relative phase oscillation between condensates, the phason, should exist. The Josephson tunneling for such a two-component system has very special properties. It is shown that the presence of  g-wave pairing does not contradict the existing SQUID experimental data on tunneling in the ab-plane. Possible ways to experimentally reveal the g-wave component and the phason in a single tunnel junction, as well as in SQUID experiments, are discussed. The dimerized quantum spin models studied in this thesis include double-layer and alternating chain Heisenberg antiferromagnets. To account for strong correlations between the S=1 elementary excitations (triplets) in the dimerized phase; the analytic Brueckner diagram approach based on a description of the excitations as triplets above a strong-coupling singlet ground state; has been applied. The quasiparticle spectrum is calculated by treating the excitations as a dilute Bose gas with infinite on-site repulsion. Analytical calculations of physical observables are in excellent agreement with numerical data.Results obtained for double layer antiferromagnet near the  (zero temperature)  quantum  critical  point  coincide  with those previously obtained within the nonlinear s model approach Additional singlet (S=0) and triplet (S=1) modes are found as two-particle bound states of the elementary triplets in the Heisenberg chain with frustration.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">superconductivity</field><field name="subject">magnetism</field><field name="subject">quantum spin models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32669</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Schubert's early progress: on the internal evidence of his compositions up to Gretchen am Spinnrade</field><field name="creator">Nettheim, Nigel, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">Franz Schubert (1797-1828) left many musical scores containing his earliest compositional efforts. Here 'earliest' is taken, for convenience, to refer to the works from the first extant (1810) up to and including the lied Gretchen am Spinnrade (1814), his first generally recognized masterpiece.  This dissertation tells the story tracing those efforts in a chronological series of analytical essays. The essays mention only incidentally the external evidence of the home environment, lessons received, concerts attended, and so on, but refer instead primarily to the internal evidence of the compositions themselves, that is, the notes on the page. That story has not previously been told in these terms. The dissertation is thus a contribution to musical analysis applied to a quite important and certainly instructive but very little-known repertoire. 	An essential feature is that the story proceeds chronologically, to the (fairly large) extent that the exact chronology is known. Over a hundred works are involved, some containing several movements, so the story is necessarily long. Further, music is by no means a simple phenomenon, so the story is necessarily detailed. Another feature contributes to the tracing of the skein of anticipations of resources used in Schubert's later and more famous works, as well as to the evidence of derivation from models of other composers' works.	Each work studied is provided with identifying information; musical incipits are also provided in view of the unfamiliarity of the repertoire. This identifying information, though necessary, is merely auxiliary to the story being told, and is accordingly set off from the latter.	After the chronological story has been completed, a series of summaries is presented under the various categories of musical analysis; these summaries naturally refer back to the individual works. The ferreting out and telling of the story is itself the aim; no hypothesis is entertained.	A review of the story yields several main results concerning the various elements of musical composition. (1) Schubert's attitude to the important matter of sonata form ranged from initial rather extreme experimentation possibly combined with some degree of misunderstanding to a clearly demonstrated ability to handle it convincingly first shown perhaps in his First Symphony D082 (October 1813). (2) Melody and text setting also showed early extremes as in the long and wild ballad Der Taucher D077 (first version September 1813 - April 1814), subsequently settling down, from about his first Opera D084 (first version October 1813 - May 1814), to a more suitable range of expression which was to serve him so well. (3) Counterpoint remained something of a weakness throughout, being used often but only in simple manifestations. (4) Harmony and orchestration were in general well handled throughout and many experiments were noted in methods of modulation. (5) An important factor to be found not in the notes but in the text of the score contributed to the mastery shown in Gretchen am Spinnrade (among other factors which are explored): Schubert's coming into contact with the inspiring poetry of Goethe.	Three conclusions are offered on the broadest level. (1) The extent of Schubert's progress as a composer over the period studied was on the whole slight, because of the wealth of resources already at his disposal at the starting point at age 13. (2) The time at which Schubert wrote his first Symphony and first Opera - about October 1813 - is proposed as marking a settling down from earlier extravagance to more acceptably controlled writing. That applies to the two genres, instrumental and vocal music, on the one hand, as well as to the techniques of form and expression, on the other. It thus divides the period studied into two stages. (I naturally hope here to avoid oversimplification and acknowledge that the division is by no means watertight.) (3) By October 1814, the end of the present investigation, it was only in vocal music and specifically the lied, thus not also in instrumental or stage music, that real mastery can be recognized.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Schubert</field><field name="subject">Gretchen Am Spinnrade</field><field name="subject">Music</field><field name="subject">Compositions</field><field name="subject">Musical analysis</field><field name="subject">Music theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32816</field></doc><doc><field name="title">???Menschenleer.??? The Aesthetics of Humanity in the Novels of Christoph Ransmayr: Die Schrecken des Eises und der Finsternis, Die letzte Welt and Morbus Kitahara</field><field name="creator">Cook, Lynne Patricia, School of German &amp; Russian Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation is a comparative study which traces the development of a distinctive aesthetics in the late twentieth century novels of the Austrian writer, Christoph Ransmayr. The three novels, Die Schrecken des Eises und der Finsternis, Die letzte Welt and Morbus Kitahara, while quite different in terms of spatial and temporal orientation, share several key features which contribute to the operation of what I define and examine as the aesthetics of humility in the texts. These recurrent thematic, structural and symbolic elements in the three novels relate to the texts??? critique of scientific modernity, their privileging of myth (both thematically and stylistically), the representation of nature and the texts??? readings of apocalypse and transformation. The theory of myth developed by Hans Blumenberg in Arbeit am Mythos provides an interpretative framework to explain the re-emergence of myth as a contemporary response to the ???absolutism of reality??? which the systems and technologies of scientific modernity have produced in the twentieth century. The first part of this thesis examines the representation in individual novels of the collapse and breakdown of selected metanarratives of modernity. The second part consists of an examination of three core myths which function to restructure the narrative of human existence in each novel. This thesis determines that the development of the aesthetics of humility in Ransmayr???s novels is dependent on the reader???s recognition of the changed perspective and the changed perception which characters in each novel experience. To different extents the characters in each novel abandon a rational perception of reality. The aesthetics of reality acknowledges a textual consciousness and privileging of the projected Other of reason; nature, myth, fantasy, irrationality and barbarity. The human subject no longer occupies the privileged central position in humanist cosmology. Displaced from the centre to the periphery of civilization, the human subject is also represented as having lost control of its physical and psychical environment. Human pretensions to power and influence over itself and its environment are negated in the texts??? revelation of the transience of life. This loss of status and place is related on a seemingly moral level to the novels??? representation of the human potential for brutality and cruelty. The ultimate disappearance of the human subject in each novel is related to the subject???s gradual objectification in the text and the final dissolution of its identity.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ransmayr Christoph 1954</field><field name="subject">Schrecken des Eises und der Finsternis</field><field name="subject">Letzte Welt</field><field name="subject">Morbus Kitahara</field><field name="subject">Humility in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32898</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of traditional versus group extension approaches on farmer behavioural change in an extensive grazing environment in the Bathurst District of New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Ajili, Abdulazim, School of Fibre Science &amp; Technology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The study on different extension approaches was undertaken in the Bathurst area of New South Wales, Australia. One hundred farmers were surveyed in random pairs according to those who belong to the formal group, ???Landcare???, and those who did not. The survey included questions on personal, physical resources, ecological and economic factors, farm practices and management (including actual practice, use of extension methods and information sources) Focussing on behavioural change over time, attitudes, perceptions and intentions.  The impact of extension approach on different levels of innovation was considered: simple (e.g. tree planting), medium (e.g. pasture development) and complex (soil erosion control) on behavioural change. It was hypothesised that the ???group??? extension approach should be more effective with complex innovations, but the main significant differences found were in level of tree planting (higher in government funded Landcare), money spent on erosion control (including tree planting) and attitudes to the severity of local erosion (all higher in Landcare members). There were no other differences in attitudes, intentions or change in farming practice except that non-Landcare farmers planted more pasture and applied more lime. The outcomes did not support the hypothesis, and it was not possible to distinguish the differences that did occur in performance from extension approach versus access to funds.  Field days are an important extension method for the adoption of cropping by landholders. Among the different extension methods, those who conducted erosion control through pastures, preferred government officers and meetings. Those who adopted tree planting and were in Landcare preferred magazines as the extension method. This added further weight to the argument that the formal group extension approach may not be perceived by its members to have any influence on adoption at this level.  Generally, mass media was more important in the early stages of adoption and personal influence more important in the evaluation stage. This also applied to simple versus complex innovations. Surprisingly all farmers placed a very high reliance on government officers for information and decision-making, particularly those in Landcare, compared to neighbours or family.  Formal group extension still needs assessing but using models other than Landcare.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural extension work</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Bathurst</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natural folates ?? method development, analysis andbioavailability of the most predominant 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in mixed diets in humans.</field><field name="creator">Vishnumohan, Shyamala, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Folate is an important B vitamin in the daily diet. It is not known to what extent naturally occurring folates in the mixed diet is bioavailable. Knowledge on to what extent the natural folates are absorbed would be best studied in a population that is not exposed to any folate fortificant. The aim of the present study was to study the bioavailability of dietary 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) in a whole day??s mixed diet relative to supplemental 5-MTHF in a selected Indian population. A dietary survey (n=200) conducted in South India, revealed a mean total intake of folate of 277+ 92.3 &#956;g/day (which is nearly 3 times higher than the current Indian Recommended Dietary Intake set to 100 &#956;g/day) based on the actual analysis of foods collected from a typical diet using a trienzyme technique followed by the microbiological assay. Further, the individual folate forms present in the foods were also analysed using a newly developed Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry LC-MS/MS). Quantification of folates was performed using internal standards. Good linearity was observed between 2-100 ng/Injection (Injection volume-100 &#956;L, R2: 0.98) that was suitable for analysis of foods (cereal, pulse, vegetables, milk based preparations and fruit) and blood samples (serum folate and erythrocyte folate) for use in bioavailability study. The folate intakes were reported to be higher (429+ 68.7 &#956;g/day) when the individual foods from the diet were analysed using the LC-MS/MS technique when compared to the values generated using microbiological assay. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that the Indian diets were predominant in 5-MTHF and the important sources being cereals, pulses and vegetables. 22 human volunteers, aged 18-25 years were recruited in India to study the bioavailability of 5-MTHF. A randomized trial (12 weeks) was designed, where the subjects consumed 400 g 5-MTHF/day in the form of as supplemental drink or an experimental diet (400 g/day) consisting predominantly 5-MTHF (90%). Relative bioavailability of 5-MTHF was calculated by comparing the responses to food folate in relation to supplemental 5-MTHF, as indicated by the biomarkers. The relative bioavailability of food folate predominant in 5-MTHF was 41% based on serum folate indicator and 47% based on erythrocyte folate status. A mean increase of 60% was observed in the erythrocyte folate levels of the subjects consuming diets predominant in 5-MTHF in 12 weeks. Diets predominant in 5-MTHF have a good potential in improving the folate status of the population.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41265</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dilemma of health reform : managing the limits of policymaking, managerialism and professionalism in health care reform</field><field name="creator">Sorensen, Ros, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hospitals worldwide are under pressure to perform and models abound to remedy poor performance.  Reform, however, is contested, uneven and slow.  One reason is that few models address a core issue in reform: the management of clinical work.  A further reason is that stakeholder groups, specifically policymakers, managers and clinicians, limit opportunities for collaborative problem solving as they seek to impose their own frame of reference in the struggle for control. I hypothesise that performance will be relatively better in hospitals that have in place strategies of agreement to set the objectives of reform, such as participative problem identification, problem solving and decision making, together with a method to manage clinical work.  This hypothesis was tested in twelve public hospitals in three Australian states between 1999 and 2001 using both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Government and hospital policy documents were assessed and semi-structured interviews were conducted to gauge the attitudes and practices of managers and clinicians regarding health care reform.  The results of the research show that hospitals with inclusive strategies for change, principally strategies of agreement, joint education and skills development, team-based incentives to direct and reward effort and a method of clinical work management, performed better than those without.  Findings indicate that policy was developed and communicated as a rational top-down process that tended to exclude diverse views.  Although the effect of different jurisdictional policy processes on hospital performance was not clear, they had considerable impact on the environment of reform.    Cost containment and patient safety dominated as policy objectives.  These alone did not engage clinician interest or address service quality.  The connection between the quality of care and its cost did not appear to be understood.  Organisational structures and processes necessary to support reform, that is communication forums for objective setting and performance review, integrated clinical and corporate accountability systems and organisational capacity building were not in place in the majority of hospitals studied.  An organisational model of clinical work management was developed to improve cost-effectiveness by balancing clinical autonomy and clinical accountability based on the research results.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health care reform</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Medical policy</field><field name="subject">Public health administration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dual coding model of processing Chinese as a second language : a cognitive-load approach</field><field name="creator">Sham, Diana Po Lan, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The research was conducted in Sydney and Hong Kong using students, from grades 5 to 9, whose first language or teaching medium was English, learning to read Chinese as second language.  According to cognitive load theory, the processing of single Chinese characters accompanied by pictures should impose extraneous cognitive load and thus hinders learning.  In Experiments 1a and 1b, simple Chinese characters appeared to be processed likes pictures.  Reading Chinese characters without pictures produced significantly better learning outcomes than reading them with pictures, suggesting that subjects processed Chinese characters and their English translations according to the Dual Coding model.  In Experiment 2, grade 6 students learned to read two-character compound words in word-and-word and picture-and-word conditions.  As expected, phonetic compounds were learned more effectively when presented along with the same word written in English than when accompanied by a picture of the object represented.   In Experiment 3, grade 6 students were used in an investigation of the differential learning effects of two-character-compound and two-single-characters formats.  The two-single-characters format, being of low element interactivity, resulted in better learning outcomes than the compound format, in which the two components were necessarily of higher element interactivity. In Experiment 4, six concrete sentences and six abstract sentences were used to investigate the learning strategies used by grade 9 students in processing second-language Chinese sentences.  In a &amp;quotno-picture &amp;quot condition, a Chinese sentence was printed on each learning card underneath the English translation; and in a &amp;quotwith-picture &amp;quot condition, a picture was positioned above the condition pair of sentences.  As expected, the mean learning outcomes were greater for the no-picture s than for the with-picture conditions, and the difference between the no-picture and with-picture means was greater for concrete sentences than for abstract sentences.  A logographic visual processing strategy was probably employed in reading concrete sentences but an analytic strategy used in reading abstract sentences.  A new dual-coding model, based on the bilingual dual coding theory for different patterns in reading Chinese as a second language at various structural levels of processing was proposed.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese language</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">Cognitive learning theory</field><field name="subject">Dual-coding hypothesis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The integration of geographical information systems and multicriteria decision making models for the analysis of branch bank closures</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Lihua, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">The research presented in this Thesis is primarily concerned with the field of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) - specifically, the business applications of the technology. The empirical problem addressed is the selection of branch banks as candidates for closure using the network of branch banks of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in the Sydney metropolitan region as the case study. Decisions to close branches are made by the Bank on the basis of performance indicators that are essentially financial. In this research, however, an alternative approach is adopted: the problem is addressed using a set of spatial criteria. Following the deregulation of the finance industry in the 1980's and the rapid introduction of new electronic channels for delivering financial services, the major banking institutions have been engaged in a process of reorganising their networks of branch banks. The most visible manifestation of this has been the ongoing and widespread closure of branches. Selecting branch banks for closure is a typical example of a complex semi-structured multi-dimensional, multi-criteria, decision-making problem. It has been well documented in previous research that Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) models are the most appropriate ones for solving problems in this particular domain. The identification of branches for closure is also characterised by a significant spatial dimension. Decisions are based on a consideration of a number of geographical criteria and various forms of spatial analysis may be involved. An appropriate technology to assist with solving decision-making problems with a significant spatial dimension is a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS). Most SDSS have been based on the integration of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technology with analytical models that are proven to be best suited to specific decision-making problems and this is the approach adopted in this research. The prototype MCBC-SDSS (Multi-Criteria Branch Closure SDSS) developed here is based on the integration through the loose coupling of the ArcView GIS software with the Criterium DecisionPlus (CDP) software, which contains the suite of non-spatial analytical models that provide the analytical capability for solving multi-criteria problems. ArcView GIS is used as the engine that drives the system and to provide the analytical and display facilities to support the spatial data involved. Two MCDM models from the CDP software are used to support the decision-making analysis - the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique (SMART). The integration of GIS with the MCDM models is based on a considerable amount of software enhancement, interface development, and computer programming. The development of the integrated system is designed to create an intelligent and user-friendly SDSS, the application of which, from the user's perspective, is a seamless operation. The success of the MCBC-SDSS is demonstrated by its application to identify candidates for closure among the 197 branches of the CBA in the Sydney metropolitan area in 2000 - the year when the building of the database for the research had been completed. The analysis is based purely on spatial considerations that have been gleaned from a major review of the literature that previous researchers have identified as affecting branch viability and performance. A set of 17 spatial variables was used as the criteria in the MCDM models. The criteria are organised in two blocks: the first includes 9 criteria relating to the characteristics of demand for branch service in the branch trade areas ('catchment area' specific criteria) while the second includes 8 criteria relating to aspects of supply provided by the existing branches in their location ('location specific' criteria). Using the developed approach, the MCBC-SDSS has been used directly to compare alternatives against criteria, not only spatial based but also financial ones, thus providing a basis for identifying the best choices regarding branch closure. The steps in the preparation of the data and the iterative procedure for implementing the MCDM models are explained and illustrated. This involves building the initial evaluation matrix, normalising the raw criteria scores, assigning weights to the criteria, and calculating priorities. Based on these, the AHP and SMART models then calculate a decision score for each branch that is used as the basis for creating the preference ranking of the branches. In this, branches with a high rank score based on the combined weighted contribution of the 17 criteria are considered to be operationally viable. On the other hand, branches with the lowest rank scores are considered as potential candidates for closure. The preference rankings generated by the models have been tested to examine their robustness in terms of the validity of criteria and their weights used in the decision analysis. Sensitivity analysis has been conducted, the results of which show that the preference rankings are stable. Different approaches have been used to validate the initial criteria, and analyse their contribution to the ranking of branch banks for closure. These help identify critical spatial variables among the 17 initial criteria selected, and suggest that some of the criteria initially selected could be deleted from the criteria list used to generate the preference rankings without substantially affecting the results. The reasonableness of the resulting preference ranking has been further demonstrated from analyses based on changing criteria weights and alternatives. The research successfully demonstrates one of the ways of enhancing the functionality of a GIS through its integration with non-spatial analytical models to develop a SDSS to aid solving decision-making problems in the selected domain. Given that to date there has been relatively few applications of SDSS similar to that developed in this research to real world decision-making problems, the procedure adopted makes it suitable for decision-making in a range of other service business applications characterised by a significant spatial dimension and multiple outlets including shopping centres, motor car dealerships, restaurant and supermarket chains. Instead of just providing solutions, however, the SDSS-based analysis in this research can better be thought of as adding value to spatial data that forms an important source of information required by decision-makers, providing insight about the situation, uncertainty, objectives, and trade-offs involved in reaching decisions, and being capable of generating alternative scenarios based on different inputs to the models that may be used to identify recommended courses of action. It can lead to better and more effective decision-making in institutions involving multi-outlet retail and service businesses and hence enables both integrated data analysis and modelling while taking multiple criteria and decision-makers' preferences into consideration.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Branch banks</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">Bank buildings</field><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Geographical information systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mesoporous, microporous and nanocrystalline materials as lithium battery electrodes.</field><field name="creator">Milne, Nicholas A, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this study it was proposed to investigate the use of 3D metal oxides (specifically titanium oxides) as potential electrode materials for lithium ion batteries. Three different approaches were taken: mesoporous materials to increase the surface area and improve the capacity; nanocrystalline materials to increase the surface area and to investigate any changes that may occur using nanocrystals; and microporous materials that are more open, allowing rapid diffusion of lithium and higher capacities.  Of the three categories of materials studies, mesoporous TiO2 was the least promising with low reversible capacities (20 mAh??g-1) due to densification resulting in a loss of surface area.  In nanocrystalline rutile an irreversible phase change occurred upon initial intercalation, however after this intercalation occurred reversibly in a single phase mechanism giving capacities of 100 mAh??g-1. A trend in intercalation potential was observed with crystallite size that was related to the ability of the structure to relax and accept lithium. Doping of rutile yielded no real improvement. Brookite gave only low capacities from a single phase intercalation mechanism. TiO2 films produced by a novel electrochemical technique showed that while amorphous films give greater capacities, more crystalline (anatase) films give greater reversibility.  Overall, microporous titanosilicates showed the most promise with sitinakite giving a reversible capacity of 80 mAh??g-1 after twenty cycles or double this when dried. The intercalation was found to occur by two steps that generate large changes in crystallite size explaining the capacity fade witnessed. While doping did not improve the performance, cation exchange has proven beneficial.  The remaining titanosilicates did not perform as well as sitinakite, however a trend was observed in the intercalation potentials with the wavenumber of the Ti-O Raman stretch. This was due to the covalent nature of the bonding. Upon reduction an electron is added to the bond meaning the energy of the bond determines intercalation potential.  Overall, most promise was shown by the microporous titanosilicates. The capacities of sitinakite after drying, are comparable to those of the "zero strain" material Li4Ti5O12. Investigation of the titanosilicates and their ion-exchanged derivatives is a promising path for new lithium-ion battery electrode materials.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrodes, Oxide.</field><field name="subject">Lithium cells.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of a New Measure of Linear Accelerator Throughput in Radiation Oncology Treatment Delivery - The Basic Treatment Equivalent (B.T.E.).</field><field name="creator">Delaney, Geoffrey Paul, SWSAHS Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">The measurement of productivity in health care is difficult. Studies in various specialty disciplines of medicine have identified that the variation in complexities (casemix) between departments or hospitals will vary and therefore will affect any basic productivity statistics that are produced. Radiation oncology is a discipline of medicine where no such studies into radiotherapy casemix variations and the effect that these may have on productivity measures have been performed, despite the high capital expenditure involved in the delivery of radiotherapy.  Radiation oncology productivity on linear accelerators is currently measured by the number of patients treated or number of treatment fields treated per unit time (usually per hour). These statistics have been collected for many years and productivity assessments were made on the variations in these statistics that exist between departments. However, these statistics do not consider the variations in casemix that occur between departments. These complexity differences may be quite marked and therefore may strongly influence the ability of a department to achieve a high patient or treatment field throughput. This may be seen as 'reduced productivity' with no consideration of the complexity of the caseload seen in the department. In addition, future technological changes that improve patient outcome may be introduced. These changes may make treatment more complex. Using older measures of productivity such as fields per hour or patients per hour will not consider these technological changes and the subsequent changes in complexity and hence departments may be seen as less productive in the future using current methods of analysis unless a more valid measure of productivity that considers complexity variations is introduced.  There have only been 3 previous attempts at developing measures of linear accelerator productivity. Each of these models have been developed empirically and have not been clinically validated. No previous attempts have been made in determining a scientifically-derived complexity model that considers the variations in treatment technique.  This thesis describes research performed between 1995 and 2001. This research study???s primary aims were to study the factors that affect radiotherapy treatment time and treatment complexity and to develop a model of linear accelerator productivity that does consider complexity variations in radiotherapy treatment delivery. This model is called the Basic Treatment Equivalent (B.T.E.). This series of trials examines the old models of linear accelerator productivity, describes the derivation and validation of the BTE model both in Australasia and the United Kingdom, identifies the factors that contribute to treatment time and treatment complexity, describes the development of a pilot model of productivity of gynaecological brachytherapy and outpatient chemotherapy using similar BTE methodology, discusses the potential uses of the BTE model, recent independent reviews of BTE by other groups, and the advantages and disadvantages of using such a model.  This research has shown that it is possible to identify the various factors that contribute to treatment time and treatment complexity and to derive a model of linear accelerator productivity that considers the variations in complexity. The BTE model has been clinically validated in Australia, New Zealand and a couple of departments in the United Kingdom and Canada and has been adopted as a new measure by various groups.

A multilevel approach was used to posit hypotheses and research questions relating individual and shared beliefs of collective efficacy to collective cognition activities, task interdependence, self-efficacy for group work, and collective orientation. A two-phase longitudinal design was employed. The sample comprised 270 university students, enrolled in seven courses and involved in 86 work groups in both phases of the study. All groups were required to perform interdependent academic tasks. The results of multiple regression analysis of aggregated variables provided some evidence that the more group members perceived themselves to be interdependent in the early stages of group work and assigned their tasks interdependently during group processes, the more likely they developed high collective efficacy in the final stages of group work. Collective efficacy was also related to the group average of self-efficacy for group work when task interdependence was high. Multilevel analysis was also used. These results showed that variation at the individual level was considerable, and there was significant but relatively little variation at the group level, with small effect sizes, for a few variables including collective efficacy. Structural equation modelling was used to confirm the theoretical framework at the individual level after accounting for group level variation. The results suggested that integration and constructive evaluation of ideas during group processes and self-efficacy for group work may have been determinants of collective efficacy at the individual level. Moreover, collective efficacy at the individual level was related to an interdependent perception of self in relation to other group members. The results suggest that helping group members learn how to evaluate and integrate each other???s ideas during group activities, and perceive themselves to be interdependent may enhance group capabilities for performing tasks. In addition, improving students??? self-efficacy for group work was identified as a key factor, as it may enhance a sense of interdependence among group members, improve the extent to which group members participate in integrating and evaluating ideas, and increase the whole group???s capabilities for performing tasks.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">collective efficacy</field><field name="subject">self-efficacy for group work</field><field name="subject">multilevel analysis</field><field name="subject">collective cognition</field><field name="subject">mental model</field><field name="subject">shared mental model</field><field name="subject">shared cognition</field><field name="subject">collective orientation</field><field name="subject">allocentrism</field><field name="subject">idiocentrism</field><field name="subject">individualism</field><field name="subject">collectivism</field><field name="subject">team</field><field name="subject">group</field><field name="subject">small group research</field><field name="subject">small group</field><field name="subject">Cognition</field><field name="subject">Group work in education</field><field name="subject">College students.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catalysed activation of cyanobacterial biosynthetic pathways by phosphopantetheinyl transferases</field><field name="creator">Copp, Janine Naomi, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cyanobacteria produce a diverse array of natural products with significant potential in many biotechnological, clinical and commercial applications. These include pharmaceuticals, such as antitumour products, antibiotics, immunosuppressants, anticholesterolemics and anti-parasitic agents, as well as veterinary therapies and agrochemicals. These compounds are synthesised by complex secondary metabolism pathways involving polyketide synthases (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), both of which require an essential phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPT) for their activity. PPTs activate the acyl, aryl and peptidyl carrier proteins within various biosynthetic pathways by the transfer of a phosphopantetheinyl moiety to an invariant serine residue. Phylogenetic analysis of the large superfamily of PPTs has revealed two separate families based on substrate specificity, which have been designated AcpS and Sfp-like. The AcpS PPT family activate acyl carrier proteins of fatty acid synthesis, while the Sfp-like PPT family, typified by the Bacillus subtilis PPT Sfp, has diverse roles in primary and secondary metabolism. The majority of cyanobacterial PPTs are of the Sfp-like PPT family and occur in genomes lacking an AcpS PPT. Phylogenetic analysis uncovered a distinct clade of cyanobacterial PPTs involved in heterocyst differentiation. Heterologous expression and functional analysis of NsPPT, the heterocyst-associated PPT in Nodularia spumigena NSOR10, represented the first characterisation of a cyanobacterial PPT. PCR-based screening was utilised to identify NsPPT and Southern hybridisation suggested this was the only PPT encoded by the N.spumigena NSOR10 genome.  Enzymatic analyses demonstrated the ability of NsPPT to phosphopantetheinylate PKS and NRPS carrier proteins from a range of metabolism pathways and cyanobacterial species. Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 encodes three PPTs. One of these PPTs, NgcS, is also a heterocyst-associated PPT and is homologous to NsPPT of N.spumigena NSOR10. Expression and enzymatic analysis of NgcS from N. punctiforme ATCC 29133, revealed contrasting phosphopantetheinylation activity to that seen for NsPPT, and indicated that NgcS may have evolved to have a strict specificity for the glycolipid biosynthesis pathway. Although the Sfp-like family of PPTs are normally associated with secondary metabolite biosynthesis, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 harbours a unique Sfp-like PPT (Sppt) but does not produce NRPS or PKS compounds. Genetic disruption of Sppt was attempted and expression of Sppt allowed the characterisation of its enzyme kinetics. Sppt displayed the ability to activate non-cognate cyanobacterial carrier proteins from NRPS and PKS biosynthetic pathways, although only at a low level of activity. This suggested that wild-type Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 would not be suitable for heterologous expression of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites. These results have important implications regarding the expression and manipulation of cyanobacterial bioactive compounds in heterologous hosts. Applications of this research may provide a biotechnological platform for the sustainable production of cyanobacterial natural products.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cyanobacteria</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">transferases.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Plurality of Identities: Ulster Protestantism in Contemporary Northern Irish Drama</field><field name="creator">Macbeth, Georgia, School of Theatre, Film &amp; Dance, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the ways in which Ulster Protestant identity has been explored in contemporary Northern Irish drama. The insecurity of the political and cultural status of Ulster Protestants from the Home Rule Crises up until Partition led to the construction and maintenance of a distinct and unified Ulster Protestant identity.  This identity was defined by concepts such as loyalty, industriousness and ???Britishness???.  It was also defined by a perceived opposite ??? the Catholicism, disloyalty and ???Irishness??? of the Republic.  When the Orange State began to fragment in the late 1960s and early 1970s, so did notions of this singular Ulster Protestant identity.  With the onset of the Troubles in 1969 came a parallel questioning and subversion of this identity in Northern Irish drama.  This was a process which started with Sam Thompson???s Over the Bridge in 1960, but which began in earnest with Stewart Parker???s Spokesong in 1975.  This thesis examines Parker???s approach and subsequent approaches by other dramatists to the question of Ulster Protestant identity.  It begins with the antithetical pronouncements of Field Day Theatre Company, which were based in an inherently Northern Nationalist ideology.  Here, the Ulster Protestant community was largely ignored or essentialised.  Against this Northern Nationalist ideology represented by Field Day have come broadly revisionist approaches, reflecting the broader cultural context of this thesis.  Ulster Protestant identity has been explored through issues of history and myth, ethnicity, class, gender and sexuality.  More recent explorations of Ulster Protestantism have also added to this diversity by presenting the little acknowledged viewpoint of extreme loyalism.  Dramatists examined in this thesis include Stewart Parker, Christina Reid, Frank McGuinness, Bill Morrison, Ron Hutchinson, Marie Jones, Graham Reid, Robin Glendinning and Gary Mitchell.  The work of Charabanc Theatre Company is also discussed.  What results from their efforts is a diverse and complex Ulster Protestant community.  This thesis argues that the concept of a singular Ulster Protestant identity, defined by its loyalty and Britishness, is fragmented, leading to a plurality of Ulster Protestant identities.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English drama</field><field name="subject">Northern Irish authors</field><field name="subject">History and criticism</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="subject">Protestantism and literature</field><field name="subject">Ulster</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pyrolysis of Fine Coal Particles at High Heating Rate and Pressure</field><field name="creator">Mill, Christopher John, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">High-intensity pyrolysis, rapid heating in an inert gas atmosphere at up to 20 atm pressure, of 6 Australian coals was examined to gain further insight into high-intensity processes such as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycles (IGCC). Experiments focussed on pyrolysis in a specially developed Wire Mesh Reactor (WMR). The particle temperature lagged that of the mesh by 0.2 seconds at a heating rate of 100??~C s -1 and was predicted by modelling. This is part of the reason the volatile yield (VY) results for 10 s hold-time at ???b1.7 wt% daf of coal, is much more reproducible than 1 s hold-time experiments at ???b4.2 wt% daf of coal. Four coals of the same rank did not behave identically when heated. Three of the coals had a pyrolysis VY the same as the proximate VM when heated to 100??~C at 1 atm but the fourth, higher inertinite coal had a 1 atm pyrolysis VY 90% of its proximate VM. All four coals of similar rank had a significant decrease in VY, between 10 and 20 wt% daf of coal, with pressure increasing from 1 to 20 atm. The two lower rank coals showed less decrease in VY with increasing pressure than the higher rank and higher inertinite coals. The lower decrease in VY with increased pressure was mostly attributed to the lower inertinite levels for both the coals of similar rank and VM, and the coals of lower rank. Char characteristics examined focussed on pore Surface Area (SA). For high intensity WMR and Drop Tube Furnace (DTF) pyrolysis experiments CO2 SA for char from a particular coal was similar but the BET   SA different. This was due to the char in the WMR experiments having longer to form larger pores determined by BET N2 SA. Both the N2 and CO2 SA was more than an order of magnitude greater than for low intensity pyrolysis char. This highlights that the WMR can be used to attain char with similar CO2 SA characteristics as other high intensity pyrolysis experiments and to provide a more meaningful insight into char reactivity than low intensity chars do.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coal Combustion</field><field name="subject">Pyrolysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface grafting of polymers via living radical polymerization techniques; polymeric supports for combinatorial chemistry</field><field name="creator">Zwaneveld, Nikolas Anton Amadeus, Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of living radical polymerization methods has shown significant potential to control grafting of polymers from inert polymeric substrates. The objective of this thesis is to create advanced substrates for use in  combinatorial chemistry applications through the use of g-radiation as a radical source, and the use of RAFT, ATRP and RATRP living radical techniques to control grafting polymerization. The substrates grafted were polypropylene SynPhase lanterns from Mimotopes and are intended to be used as supports for combinatorial chemistry. ATRP was used to graft polymers to SynPhase lanterns using a technique where the lantern was functionalized by exposing the lanterns to gamma-radiation from a 60Co radiation source in the presence of carbon tetra-bromide, producing short chain polystyrene tethered bromine atoms, and also with CBr4 directly functionalizing the surface. Styrene was then grafted off these lanterns using ATRP.  MMA was graft to the surface of SynPhase lanterns, using g-radiation initiated RATRP at room temperature. It was found that the addition of the thermal initiator, AIBN, successfully increased the concentration of radicals to a level where we could achieve proper control of the polymerization.  RAFT was used to successfully control the grafting of styrene, acrylic acid and N,N???-dimethylacrylamide to polypropylene SynPhase Lanterns via a -initiated RAFT agent mediated free radical polymerization process using cumyl phenyldithioacetate and cumyl dithiobenzoate RAFT agents.  Amphiphilic brush copolymers were produced with a novel combined RAFT and ATRP system. Polystyrene-co-poly(vinylbenzyl chloride) created using gamma-radiation and controlled with the RAFT agent PEPDA was used as a backbone. The VBC moieties were then used as initiator sites for the ATRP grafting of t-BA to give a P(t-BA) brush that was then hydrolyzed to produce a PAA brush polymer.  FMOC loading tests were conducted on all these lanterns to assess their effectiveness as combinatorial chemistry supports. It was found that the loading could be controlled by adjusting the graft ratio of the lanterns and had a comparable loading to those commercially produced by Mimotopes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ATRP</field><field name="subject">RAFT</field><field name="subject">Radiation</field><field name="subject">polymerization</field><field name="subject">grafting</field><field name="subject">living radical polymerization</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A FRAMEWORK FOR CONCEPTUAL INTEGRATION OF HETEROGENEOUS DATABASES</field><field name="creator">Srinivasan, Uma, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Autonomy of operations combined with decentralised management of data has given rise to a number of heterogeneous databases or information systems within an enterprise.  These systems are often incompatible in structure as well as content and hence difficult to integrate.  This thesis investigates the problem of heterogeneous database integration, in order to meet the increasing demand for obtaining meaningful information from multiple databases without disturbing local autonomy.  In spite of heterogeneity, the unity of overall purpose within a common application domain, nevertheless, provides a degree of semantic similarity which manifests itself in the form of similar data structures and common usage patterns of existing information systems.  This work introduces a conceptual integration approach that exploits the similarity in meta level information in existing systems and performs metadata mining on database objects to discover a set of concepts common to heterogeneous databases within the same application domain.  The conceptual integration approach proposed here utilises the background knowledge available in database structures and usage patterns and generates a set of concepts that serve as a domain abstraction and provide a conceptual layer above existing legacy systems.   This conceptual layer is further utilised by an information re-engineering framework that customises and packages information to reflect the unique needs of different user groups within the application domain.  The architecture of the information re-engineering framework is based on an object-oriented model that represents the discovered concepts as customised application objects for each distinct user group.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heterogeneous databases</field><field name="subject">metadata mining</field><field name="subject">conceptual integration</field><field name="subject">intelligent integration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33463</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluid dynamical investigation of a ventricular assist device</field><field name="creator">Nugent, Allen Harold, Biomedical Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Spiral Vortex (SV) ventricular assist device (VAD) was investigated by 2-component laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) while pumping a refractive index-matched blood analogue fluid. The VAD was operated under physiological conditions corresponding to 75% assist (4 litres/minute) or weaning from assist (2 litres/minute). Data were sampled on a 5-mm grid throughout most of the interior of the blood chamber, using two orthogonal LDA configurations from which 3D velocity data were synthesised.  Data were subjected to statistical analysis of quasistatic time intervals and approximation by Fourier series. The velocity vector fields were explored statically (via 2D plots) and dynamically (using 3D animations of the reduced data). Reynolds stresses were computed and visualised in 2D. Fluid pathlines were simulated and plotted in 3D.  The flow was found to be dominated by an irrotational vortex that accelerated and precessed in phase with the pumping diaphragm. Two unexpected flow structures, a rising, swirling near-wall layer in diastole and a reflection of the outflow vortex upon valve closure, enhanced washing of the walls. The thickness of the boundary layer was estimated to be 2 mm. Fluid velocities were generally lower than those reported in steady-flow studies on the SV VAD, although turbulence was comparable.  Under the weaning mode, the coherence of the main vortex was degraded and flow recirculation was observed distal to the inflow port; this operating mode must be regarded as an indication for anticoagulation. In both pumping modes, turbulence was elevated in association with asymmetric buckling of the pneumatically driven diaphragm.  Suboptimal orientation of the tilting-disc inlet valve gave rise to augmented turbulence production and skewing of the main vortex; similar results were obtained for an axisymmetric polymer (Jellyfish) valve, despite its advantageous haemodynamics. Flow stagnation was apparent where the inflow stream impinged on the wall, opposite the inflow port. The overall design of the SV VAD appears to almost ideal, in the context of current technology. However, elimination of recirculation/stagnation zones, especially in the weaning mode, remains a priority for the ultimate optimisation of haemocompatibility. Pulsatile VADs will probably never be entirely free of flow recirculation or stagnation, and published claims to the contrary probably reflect study limitations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blood flow</field><field name="subject">Measurement</field><field name="subject">Heart Artificial</field><field name="subject">Artificial heart</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metal dusting on heat-resistant alloys under thermal cyclic conditions</field><field name="creator">Toh, Chin Hock, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Solid oxide fuel cells operate at elevated temperature, oxidising fuel gases to generate electricity. The fuel gas streams in the fuel cell systems are rich in carbon and have very low oxygen potential. Under these conditions, alloys can undergo metal dusting, which causes pitting or general thinning of the alloys. This process is not yet fully understood. It is, hence, not possible to accurately predict the susceptibility of a particular alloy in the atmospheres relevant to SOFC. Model Fe-Cr and Fe-Ni-Cr alloys were exposed to test the hypothesis that cementite formation and its decomposition is necessary for metal dusting to occur. A series of ferritic and austenitic engineering alloys were also exposed to compare their dusting rates. Two specimens of each alloy were studied, one was etched in a H3PO4-15%H2SO4-21%H2O solution and the other was ground to a 600-grit finish. The alloys were exposed to a CO-26%H2-6%H2O gas mixture at 680oC under thermal cyclic conditions. The hot gas composition corresponded to ac = 2.9 and an oxygen potential high enough to oxidise chromium, but not iron or nickel.  All the alloys were shown to undergo internal carburisation, metal dusting and coking once the protective chromium oxide scale was damaged. Fe-25Cr was less resistant than Fe-60Cr because of its lower chromium content. However, ferritic Fe-25Cr-based steels are more resistant to dusting than austenitic Fe-25Cr-25Ni. The present findings are consistent with the earlier conclusions that cementite formation is essential for dusting on ferritic steels and that dusting of austenitic alloys does not involve the prior formation of cementite and its decomposition. The onset of metal dusting was more accelerated for most austenitic engineering alloys (Alloy 800, Inconel 601, 690, 693 and Alloy 602CA) than for engineering ferritic steels (Fe-27Cr-0.001Y). However, the alloy with the best performance was austenitic Inconel 625, which was still protected by its Cr2O3 scale after 500 one-hour cycles. In both ferritic and austenitic chromia-formers alloys, the surface ground specimens were more resistant to metal dusting than the electropolished specimens. In contrast, ferritic alumina-formers with electropolished surfaces did not dust during the entire experimental periods of 1200 one-hour cycle, but the alloys with ground surfaces slowly underwent dusting attack. The coke deposits formed consisted largely of graphite nanotubes, containing small particles at the tube tips. These particles were identified as single crystal cementite, in the case of ferritic steels, and austenite, for the austenitic alloys. This is not in agreement with the currently accepted dusting model for ferritic steels that cementite decomposition yields iron particles, which catalyse coke deposition. EDX analysis of the cementite particles, showed that the only metal detected was iron, thus differing in chemistry from the (Fe,Cr)3C surface layer. Similarly, the austenite particles contained only nickel and iron, differing in chemistry from the disintegrated alloy surfaces. These results suggested that the particles were formed in the coke in the carbon-supersaturated gas, rather than disintegration of the alloy surface layer. Strong orientation relationships were determined between the graphite and cementite particles; however, no clear crystallographic relationship was deduced between the graphite and austenite. Relative alloy performance appears consistent using the present multiple one-hour cycle and the results of others using a smaller number of lengthy cycles. Hourly thermal cycling was shown to accelerate the dusting onset for both electropolished chromia-formers and surface ground alumina-formers. Protective oxide scales spall at a critical thickness and carbon attack results when the alloy surfaces are depleted of scale-forming elements and healing becomes impossible. On this basis, analytical models were developed and used to predict the incubation periods for oxide failure and the subsequent carbon attack. Upon testing, these models were, however, found to be not qualitatively meaningful in predicting the onset of dusting observed in the present study. Gross oversimplifications involved in the model and the absence of reliable data for many parameters required for the computations prevented even an approximate quantitative prediction.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heat resistant alloys</field><field name="subject">Corrosion</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The aetiology and mechanisms of serious injury in restrained child occupants</field><field name="creator">Brown, Julie, Prince of Wales Hospital Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">The primary intervention for injury in children traveling in cars in Australia has involved the mandatory use of a restraint while traveling in a vehicle. This intervention has been successful as evidenced by high restraint usage rates by Australian children and substantial casualty reductions since the 1970&#146;s. However casualty rates have been relatively stagnant over the last couple of decades. Currently more than 3,000 child occupants are seriously injured in Australia every year. There is a need to examine the scope for further preventing injury among restrained child occupants. This thesis presents four interrelated studies examining the factors and mechanisms involved when Australian children are seriously injured while using some form of restraint in a crash. Methods used include retrospective medical record review, in-depth crash investigation and analysis of mass in-depth crash data. Both descriptive and nonparametric statistical analysis techniques, including those that allow for the control of potential confounders, were used. Observations and results indicate there is substantial scope for further reducing serious injury in children traveling in cars in Australia. To realize this reduction there is a need to address the quality of restraint use by children through the development of strategies that not only encourage restraint use, but encourage the correct use of the most appropriate forms of restraint. There is also a need to address the protection provided by restraint systems and vehicles to child occupants in high severity crashes, and in crashes that involve impacts with fixed roadside objects such as trees and poles.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Injuries</field><field name="subject">Causes and Theories of Causation</field><field name="subject">Child restraint systems in automobiles</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The transplanted bush: dislocation, desire and the domestic</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Sally, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Transplanted Bush: Dislocation, Desire and the Domestic takes as its theme the idea of the Australian bush and seeks new ways to represent it within the traditions of Australian figurative landscape painting. The research identifies ways to disrupt the bush brand, a paradigm that has played a significant and romantic role in the construction of Australian national identity, as a rallying point for nationalist sentiment and to sell Australia to the world as a unique tourist destination. The bush, as a space that is anti-city, an idea that generally relies on a British genealogy, and one that is constructed according to hetero-normative strategies, is significant in the creation of Australian identity because it is widely regarded as the real Australia. Real in this context has somehow become distorted to mean those parts of our nation that make us distinct from the rest of the world, while continuing to reflect the values and aspirations of a dominant culture and its heroic history of colonising and domesticating a strange land. The overriding focus of this investigation has been to determine to what extent it is possible to reconceptualize the bush brand so that it can accommodate new themes of identity, particularly in relation to gender and sexuality. This research adopts the position that the bush is an idea that has relied heavily upon myths, legends and mono-cultural perspectives for its construction and, as a result, is open to negotiation. Consequently, this investigation takes place at the very heart of the bush paradigm, within its grand master narratives, by engaging with its symbols and signifiers. It reviews the ideological and representational role played by the traditional model of Australian figurative landscape painting, and considered how it can be reinvested with new signs, symbols, motifs, colours and ideas. By developing and introducing a new vocabulary of signs and symbols that erodes the distinctions between the bush, the urban and the domestic, this research disrupts the internal logic and coherence of the bush brand.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rainbow holograms</field><field name="creator">Rush, Amy, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Rainbow holography is the medium I have chosen to specialize in. Holography itself uses light as a sculptural element. In regards to my work, rainbow holography stresses the field of experimentation with the light spectrum until a certain point that I define as travelling the superhighway from reality to virtual worlds. My work appears then as the documentation, in the form of rainbow holograms, of this travel. It depicts narrative imagery while capturing the moments I existed in this virtual world set behind the rainbow.  This project aims to present through still, 3D and filmic imagery the co ??? existence of the physical body and its psychological realm. The psychological reality is articulated as a fictional landscape and the rainbow is used as a metaphor for travel between real and virtual worlds. More importantly, I see holography or rainbow holography as a means of crystallising the vision of the unreachable world behind the rainbow. I see my practice as a new way of using this medium by using this rainbow world as subject matter within the rainbow hologram.  By experimenting with combined image processing techniques within rainbow holography, such as analogue white light transmission holograms, full colour digital stereograms, and dot matrix holograms, it becomes possible to generate a synthetic new world. Here each pixel can have the potential to be every color of the rainbow spectrum simultaneously, depending on the angle of the eye of the perceiver. It is here that my investigation through holographic representation has led me to explore and create other worldly landscapes and to extend reality.  Our longing to travel over the rainbow into our imagination is with us from a very young age. For me this desire has lasted well into adulthood and has somehow found itself at the centre of my creations over the last few years. The childlike and na??ve appearance of my imagery has the ability to evoke the feeling in the viewers of the nostalgia they may have felt as a child, when confronted with the intense experience and wonder of the imaginings of the rainbow. My work trades on a misunderstanding that the medium of holography is taken as a direct representation of an existing reality.  My first hologram I???m a rainbow depicts an alter-egotistical projection of myself as a rainbow princess living in a far away fairytale rainbow galaxy, and communicating with earth beings via the technology of the message contained within the hologram. The hologram has often been associated in science fiction with a message to save the planet. This body of work invites viewers to delve into the depths of their imagination, to save this place where I have travelled by believing in it. As in the story of peter pan where the children are asked to clap their hands if they believe in fairies, by others believing in my imagination they are able to save it.  The world within the imagination holds no fixed place; it is a shifting and dynamic space. This quality is shared with the rainbow, which is similarly ephemeral, vanishing and appearing within the eye of the beholder according to weather patterns. The rainbow hologram is a fixed rainbow. When replayed through the eyes of the viewer, the interaction with the real rainbow is recalled, and the viewer enters into the imagination to perceive the work.  Throughout this paper I have referred to concepts and techniques in other fields such as physics, anthropology, art history and theory. My research is by no means intended as primarily a technical examination of the medium of rainbow holography. The holographic environments I have made rearrange elements from the real world with fictitious realities. They make people feel as if they are viewing a world that is real, but which imitates unreal ideas. These holographic environments enable viewers to experience ideas as a real place.  As Rainbow holography is a relatively new medium, and as my own work uses the rainbow as a multi-layered tool I feel it necessary to investigate the appearance of the rainbow in nature and the reaction of humans to the rainbow as a mythical component in ancient cultures. I am interested in investigating how the rainbow has been used a metaphor for travelling from a material world to ???other worlds??? through its presence in various imaging processes through specific art works. The different ways the rainbow has been used have enabled me to more accurately understand my own work as being a nexus between depicting and generating rainbows. Furthermore, in the discussion of the application of rainbow holography I can show that my own work is necessarily different because of the way I am depicting a rainbow to explore undiscovered territory in which I am the author. Finally I look at how holography is perceived by the public, which helps me to explain the way in which my own work is perceived. Deliberately using the idea of an image in its surrounding context has helped to achieve my desired outcome: to make people believe that the world behind the rainbow really does exist and that I have travelled there, and that they too can do so via viewing my work.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rainbow.</field><field name="subject">Art and holography.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reuse of industrial products - a technical and economic model for decision support</field><field name="creator">Anityasari, Maria, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the field of sustainable manufacturing, a wide range of research has been carried out to attain the more effective use of natural resources and the reduction of environmental impacts during the whole product life cycle.

The objective of this research has been to develop a comprehensive assessment model, integrating technical, environmental, social, and economic aspects to evaluate the reusability of industrial products. The assessment model consists of four sub-models, which are a methodology to assess the quality and reliability of products, a model to translate the social responsibility aspect into warranty cost, a methodology to integrate environmental costs, and an economic model to accumulate total life cycle cost as the basis of the evaluation. The model also facilitates trade-offs between the factors to investigate the possibility to improve the reusability of a product. To apply the assessment model in the real business environment, a set of decisionmaking methodologies under different take-back scenarios has been developed as a guideline for manufacturers. Furthermore, as the existence of uncertainty in the reuse strategy is undeniable, a methodology to integrate uncertainties into the assessment model is also developed. The model validation, using three real cases collected from industrial partners on consumer and commercial products, has confirmed the applicability of the model to provide a useful tool to evaluate products at the end of their life cycle. The model also enables decision makers to disclose the risk associated with the decision, thus improving the quality of the decision. The results are in good agreement with the basic theory that the reuse and remanufacturing strategy is highly recommended from both environmental and economic reasons.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making -- Methodology</field><field name="subject">Remanufacturing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factor analysis of high dimensional time series</field><field name="creator">Heaton, Chris, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of research into the use of factor models for stationary economic time series. Two basic scenarios are considered. The first is a situation where a large number of observations are available on a relatively small number variables, and a dynamic factor model is specified. It is shown that a dynamic factor model may be derived as a representation of a VARMA model of reduced spectral rank observed subject to measurement error. In some cases the resulting factor model corresponds to a minimal state-space representation of the VARMA plus noise model. Identification is discussed and proved for a fairly general class of dynamic factor model, and a frequency domain estimation procedure is proposed which has the advantage of generalising easily to models with rich dynamic structures. The second scenario is one where both the number of variables and the number of observations jointly diverge to infinity. The principal components estimator is considered in this case, and consistency is proved under assumptions which allow for much more error cross-correlation than the previously published theorems. Ancillary results include finite sample/variables bounds linking population principal components to population factors, and consistency results for principal components in a dual limit framework under a `gap' condition on the eigenvalues. A new factor model, named the Grouped Variable Approximate Factor Model, is introduced. This factor model allows for arbitrarily strong correlation between some of the errors, provided that the variables corresponding to the strongly correlated errors may be arranged into groups. An approximate instrumental variables estimator is proposed for the model and consistency is proved.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">time series</field><field name="subject">factor analysis</field><field name="subject">principal components</field><field name="subject">Time-series analysis -- Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40946</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sir Philip Baxter, Engineer: The Fabric of a Conservative Style of Thought</field><field name="creator">Gissing, Philip, School of Science &amp; Technology Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the life and career of Sir Philip Baxter (1905-1989), particularly during the period following his arrival in Australia from England in 1950. But the thesis is not a conventional biographical study in terms of either the sources used or its guiding themes. Instead, my subject's values and attitudes are portrayed as reflections of a 'conservative style of thought', a concept developed by Karl Mannheim. This approach, centred on close readings of key texts, permits a deeper understanding of a figure who polarised opinion over a long career as Chairman of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, and as Vice-Chancellor of the University of NSW. My picture of Baxter draws significantly on the Archives of the University of NSW, which provided the bulk of my primary sources, such as correspondence files, typescripts of articles and talks, newspaper clippings, official documents and personal memorabilia. This material is a substantial but curiously unrevealing source for Baxter's life. Although I rely largely on written material, on several important occasions I refer to discussions I had with Baxter's children, colleagues and students. Insights thereby gained into Baxter's childhood reading, and the circumstances of the composition of his play, The Day the Sun Rose in the West, profoundly influenced my portrayal of Baxter. Throughout, I argue for an appreciation of the significance of such material, even though in a more conventional study of an engineer/administrator it would be thought of only marginal interest. In Baxter's case, certainly, careful interpretation of such material enables the construction of a compelling portrait of the man despite the unrevealing primary records and the still often fervently partisan personal recollections of those who knew him. My major conclusion is that previous characterisations of Baxter as a cold war warrior of the post-war period in Australia have failed to appreciate the complexity and coherence of his attitudes and philosophy. Secondly, I demonstrate that the notion of a 'conservative style of thought' captures that complexity as evidenced in the many facets of Baxter's career and interests.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philip Baxter</field><field name="subject">chemical engineers</field><field name="subject">college administrators</field><field name="subject">biography</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17017</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catalysts, Continuity and Change: Workplace Restructuring in the Chemical Industry</field><field name="creator">Mealor, Tony, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis describes and analyses a long-term transformative change program conducted at ICI (Australia) Botany Site between the years 1987 - 1997.

Change interventions developed in the program have diffused through Australian industry over the decade. The program is analysed within the framework of a theoretical model which describes a path taken towards achieving a capable organisation which can sustain productive performance. The thesis uses evidence from the case to investigate issues of management style, governance, flexibility, 'bundled interventions', productivity, work organisation, downsizing, reward systems, skills acquisition and self-managed teams.

Early diagnosis of HIT is important to reduce morbidity and mortality. I developed an enzyme immunoassay that detects the binding of HIT IgG to PF4-heparin in the fluid phase. This required techniques to purify and biotinylate PF4. The fluid phase assay produces consistently low background and can detect low levels of anti-PF4-heparin. It is suited to testing alternative anticoagulants because, unlike in an ELISA, a clearly defined amount of antigen is available for antibody binding. I was able to detect anti-PF4-heparin IgG in 93% of HIT patients. I also investigated cross-reactivity of anti-PF4-heparin antibodies with PF4 complexed to alternative heparin-like anticoagulants. Low molecular weight heparins cross-reacted with 88% of the sera from HIT patients while half of the HIT sera weakly cross-reacted with PF4-danaparoid (Orgaran). The thrombocytopenia and thrombosis of most of these patients resolved during danaparoid therapy, indicating that detection of low affinity antibodies to PF4-danaparoid by immunoassay may not be an absolute contraindication for danaparoid administration. While HIT patients possess antibodies to PF4-heparin, I observed that HIT antibodies will also bind to PF4 alone adsorbed on polystyrene ELISA wells but not to soluble PF4 in the absence of heparin. Having developed a technique to affinity-purify anti-PF4-heparin HIT IgG, I provide the first estimates of the avidity of HIT IgG. HIT IgG displayed relatively high functional affinity for both PF4-heparin (Kd=7-30nM) and polystyrene adsorbed PF4 alone (Kd=20-70nM). Furthermore, agarose beads coated with PF4 alone were almost as effective as beads coated with PF4 plus heparin in depleting HIT plasmas of anti-PF4-heparin antibodies. I conclude that the HIT antibodies which bind to polystyrene adsorbed PF4 without heparin are largely the same IgG molecules that bind PF4-heparin and thus most HIT antibodies bind epitope(s) on PF4 and not epitope(s) formed by part of a PF4 molecule and part of a heparin molecule. Binding of PF4 to heparin (optimal) or polystyrene/agarose (sub-optimal) promotes recognition of this epitope. Under conditions that are more physiological and sensitive than previous studies, I observed that affinity-purified HIT IgG will cause platelet aggregation upon the addition of heparin. Platelets activated with HIT IgG increased their release and surface expression of PF4. I quantitated the binding of affinity-purified HIT 125I-IgG to platelets as they activate in a plasma milieu. Binding of the HIT IgG was dependent upon heparin and some degree of platelet activation. Blocking the platelet Fc??? receptor-II with the monoclonal antibody IV.3 did not prevent HIT IgG binding to activated platelets. I conclude that anti-PF4-heparin IgG is the only component specific to HIT plasma that is required to induce platelet aggregation. The Fab region of HIT IgG binds to PF4-heparin that is on the surface of activated platelets. I propose that only then does the Fc portion of the bound IgG activate other platelets via the Fc receptor. My data support a dynamic model of platelet activation where released PF4 enhances further antibody binding and more release.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">heparin</field><field name="subject">thrombocytopenia</field><field name="subject">platelet factor 4</field><field name="subject">PF4</field><field name="subject">platelets</field><field name="subject">antibody avidity</field><field name="subject">antibody affinity</field><field name="subject">epitope</field><field name="subject">heparinoid</field><field name="subject">low molecular weight heparin</field><field name="subject">HIT</field><field name="subject">HITS</field><field name="subject">HITT</field><field name="subject">HAT</field><field name="subject">white clot syndrome</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Retirement in Mobile and Manufactured Housing on the North Coast of New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Secomb, Dorothy Margaret, School of Social Science &amp; Policy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study considers relocatable homes as an alternative housing choice for male and female retirees fifty years of age and over. Homogeneous parks and estates planned for a specific type of relocatable home are compared with those which evolved from tourist parks and retain sites for both permanent and short-term occupancy.  Four relocatable home  environments are considered: caravan parks, mobile homes in mixed parks, manufactured homes in mixed parks and manufactured housing estates.  The differential effects of 'age', 'house type' and 'housing environment' upon 'residential satisfaction', 'sense of community within the neighbourhood', 'social integration in the community' and 'psychological adjustment' form the analytical framework of the study.  Residents of 34 parks/ estates on the North Coast of New South Wales completed 778 questionnaires.  Case studies, interviews, letters and written  comments provided data for qualitative analysis.  Approximately 94% of respondents are satisfied with their homes and housing environments.  Residential satisfaction is most influenced by the interactions and perceptions of residents; psychological adjustment is influenced by a positive attitudes towards self and one's neighbours;  integration in the community is affected by levels of network.  Each of these relate strongly with having a sense of community in the neighbourhood.  Space internal to the dwelling relates to satisfaction, adjustment and community integration.  External space relates to the need for a well planned neighbourhood which affords privacy, safety and amenities.  The need for meeting places for small and large groups was recurrent.  The results suggest that residents of relocatable homes tend to retain affiliation with organisations joined prior to relocation.  They are not reliant on their new neighbours to integrate in their community.  This result is contrary to prior research which studied site built homes and traditional neighbourhoods. The present high levels of residential satisfaction would rise if it were not for the overwhelming uncertainty of tenure and unjustifiable rises in site rent.  The study reviews government policy especially in relation to tenure.        A relocatable home offers no more affordability than a site-built home in the same area in the long-term but it  does offer a preferred retirement lifestyle.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile homes New South Wales North Coast</field><field name="subject">Retirement communities New South Wales North Coast</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Application of Molecular Genetics to the Conservation Management of Quolls, Dasyurus Species (Dasyuridae:Marsupialia)</field><field name="creator">Firestone, Karen Beth, School of Biological Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The quolls are among the largest of the remaining carnivorous marsupials in the Australasian region, and thus occupy an important ecological niche as top predators and scavengers.  All quolls are currently in decline and threatened to some degree yet the application of molecular information to the conservation and management of quolls has been unexplored until now.  In this thesis I use two independent and highly variable genetic marker systems, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region and nuclear microsatellites, to explore various aspects of conservation genetics relevant to the management of quolls.  These aspects include an examination of the phylogenetic or evolutionary relationships among all six species of quolls, an examination of the genetic diversity within populations and the degree of differentiation between populations of the four Australian species of quolls, and the definition of units for conservation within these species.  The development of suitable nuclear markers was a vital first step in defining levels of genetic variability and differentiation within and between the different populations and species.  These markers proved to be highly variable and provided a wealth of information of relevance to the conservation of these species, and will be extremely useful in further studies.  The use of the mtDNA control region for phylogenetic analyses was a novel approach to examining this question in quolls and also proved to be highly informative.  Results from these phylogenetic analyses highlight the necessity of 1) examining more than one exemplar of each species, as well as 2) finally bringing some consensus to the question of the evolutionary relationships among quolls.  Results show that northern quolls form the earliest split from all other quolls and that western quolls are closely related to the two New Guinean species.  Furthermore, there is evidence for distinct lineages within species, corresponding to geographically separate or isolated populations.  Levels of genetic variability within populations were examined using the microsatellites developed previously.  Genetic variation was significantly higher in western quolls than in any other species.  This was surprising given the long term and widespread decline of this species.  There were also significant differences between populations within species in the level of genetic variability.  Low levels of variability were usually found in small or captive bred populations or populations in severe decline.  Genetic differentiation between populations was also explored using microsatellites.  Significant differentiation in allele frequency distributions was found between most pairwise population comparisons, indicating that each of these populations forms a separate management unit (MU) for conservation purposes.  One notable exception was found among populations of tiger quolls from a highly localized area in the Barrington Tops region of New South Wales.  Using microsatellites, these populations were not significantly subdivided and thus appeared to be one MU.  Using mtDNA, however, these populations were significantly subdivided and thus should be considered separate MUs.  Differences in the way these two genetic markers are inherited (mtDNA is maternally inherited, microsatellites are biparentally inherited) provides a clue as to the social structure and organization of these cryptic nocturnal species.  Consequently, the use of different genetic marker systems shows that there is sex-biased migration within this species.  Finally, the degree of genetic differentiation observed within tiger quolls does not conform to the currently recognized subspecific categories within this species.  The major genetic split occurs between the Tasmanian and mainland populations of tiger quolls, not between Dasyurus maculatus maculatus and D. m. gracilis.  Thus, the Tasmanian and mainland populations form two distinct evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) for conservation purposes, and I propose that the Tasmanian populations should be elevated to the subspecific status to account for this.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dasyurus viverrinus</field><field name="subject">Marsupials Molecular genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17491</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coupled Solitary Waves in Optical Waveguides</field><field name="creator">Mak, William Chi Keung, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Soliton states in three coupled optical waveguide systems were studied: two linearly coupled waveguides with quadratic nonlinearity, two linearly coupled waveguides with cubic nonlinearity and Bragg gratings, and a quadratic nonlinear waveguide with resonant gratings, which enable three-wave interaction.  The methods adopted to tackle the problems were both analytical and numerical.  The analytical method mainly made use of the variational approximation.  Since no exact analytical method is available to find solutions for the waveguide systems under study, the variational approach was proved to be very useful to find accurate approximations. Numerically, the shooting method and the relaxation method were used. The numerical results verified the results obtained analytically.  New asymmetric soliton states were discovered for the coupled quadratically nonlinear waveguides, and for the coupled waveguides with both cubic nonlinearity and Bragg gratings. Stability of the soliton states was studied numerically, using the Beam Propagation Method.  Asymmetric couplers with quadratic nonlinearity were also studied. The bifurcation diagrams for the asymmetric couplers were those unfolded from the corresponding diagrams of the symmetric couplers. Novel stable two-soliton bound states due to three-wave interaction were discovered for a quadratically nonlinear waveguide equipped with resonant gratings.  Since the coupled optical waveguide systems are controlled by a larger number of parameters than in the corresponding single waveguide, the coupled systems can find a much broader field of applications.

The key outcome targetted by this reform is increased efficiency, measured by a range of factors, including cost reduction, increased savings, and a more facilitative environment for business activity. These benefits are sought by the proponents of reform as part of a push to increase national prosperity, but concerns that social equity is undermined by it are expressed by opponents of that reform. The debate between efficiency and equity is raging in current Australian tax policy, a key site for micro-economic reform.  As Government Budget restructuring occurs in Australia, demographic change (eg, the ageing population) undermines the ability of public funded welfare to provide retirement benefits. Responsibility for self-funded retirement is an important contributor to increasing private savings. Investment in growth assets such as corporate stock is increasing in Australia, however concerns about volatility of asset values and yield stimulate the importance of investment risk management techniques. Financial contract innovation utilising financial derivatives is a dominant mechanism for that risk management. Synthetic equity products which are characterised by capital protection and enhanced yield are popular and efficient equity risk management vehicles, and are observed globally, particularly in the North American market. Financial contract innovation, risk management using financial derivatives, and synthetic equity products suffer from an adverse tax regulatory response in Australia, which deprives Australian investors from access to important savings vehicles.  The negative Australian tax response stems from anachronistic legislation and jurisprudence, which emphasises tax outcomes based on legal form. The pinnacle of this approach is the tax law insistence on characterisation of financial contracts as either debt or equity, despite some important financial similarities between these two asset types. Since derivatives produce transactions with novel legal forms this approach is unresponsive to innovation. The negative tax result also stems from a perception that the new products are tax arbitrage vehicles, offering tax benefits properly available to investment in stocks, which is thought to be inappropriate when the new products resemble debt positions (particularly when they are capital protected and yield enhanced). The negative tax response reflects administrative concerns about taxpayer equity and revenue leakage. This approach seeks to impose tax linearity by proxy: rather than utilising systemic reform to align the tax treatment of debt and equity, the current strategy simply denies the equity tax benefits to a variety of innovative financial contracts. It deprives Australians of efficiency enhancing savings products, which because of an adverse tax result are unattractive to investors.  The weakness of the current approach is illustrated by critical analysis of three key current and proposed tax laws: the ???debt dividend??? rules in sec. 46D Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (the ???Tax Act???); the 1997 Budget measures (which seek to integrate related stock and derivative positions); and the proposals in the Taxation of Financial Arrangements Issues Paper (which include a market value tax accounting treatment for ???traded equity,??? and propose a denial of the tax benefits for risk managed equity investments).  The thesis develops a model for financial analysis of synthetic equity products to verify the efficiency claims made for them. The approach is described as the ???Tax ReValue??? model. The Tax ReValue approach isolates the enhanced investment returns possible for synthetic equity, and the model is tested by application to the leading Australian synthetic equity product, the converting preference share. The conclusions reached are that the converting preference share provides the key benefits of enhanced investment return and lower capital costs to its corporate issuer. This financial efficiency analysis is relied upon to support the assertion that a facilitative tax response to such products is appropriate. The facilitative response can be delivered by a reformulation of the existing tax rules, or by systemic reform.  The reformulation of the existing tax rules is articulated by a Rule of Reason, which is proposed in the thesis as the basis for the allocation and retention of the equity tax benefits. To avoid concerns about taxpayer equity and revenue leakage the Rule of Reason proposes a Two Step approach to the allocation of the equity tax benefits to synthetics. The financial analysis is used to quantify non-tax benefits of synthetic equity products, and to predict whether and to what extent the security performs financially like debt or equity. This financial analysis is overlayed by a refined technical legal appraisal of whether the security contains the essential legal ???Badges of Equity.??? The resulting form and substance approach provides a fair and equitable control mechanism for perceived tax arbitrage, whilst facilitating efficient financial contract innovation.  The ultimate source of non-linearity in the taxation of investment capital is the differential tax benefits provided to equity and debt. To promote tax linearity the differentiation needs to be removed, and the thesis makes recommendations for systemic reform, particularly concerning the introduction of a system of ???Franked Debt.??? The proposed system of ???Franked Debt??? would align the tax treatment of debt and equity by replacing the corporate interest deduction tax benefit with a lender credit in respect of corporate tax paid. This credit would operate mechanically like the existing shareholder imputation credit. The interface of this domestic tax credit scheme with the taxation of International investment capital, and the problems occasioned by constructive delivery of franking credits to Australian taxpayers via synthetics, are resolved by the design and costings of the new system, which has the potential to be revenue positive.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Derivative securities  Taxation  Law and legislation  Australia</field><field name="subject">Dividends  Taxation  Law and legislation  Australia</field><field name="subject">Stocks  Taxation  Law and legislation  Australia</field><field name="subject">Investments  Taxation  Law and legislation  Australia</field><field name="subject">Corporations  Taxation  Law and legislation  Australia</field><field name="subject">Taxation  Law and legislation  Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17591</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pharmacokinetics, Cerebrovascular Permeability &amp; Biotransformation of the Neurotoxic Plasticiser N-butylbenzenesulfonamide (NBBS)</field><field name="creator">Samiayah, Ganesh Kumar, School of Physiology &amp; Pharmacology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The pharmacokinetics, oral bioavailability, cerebrovascular permeability and biotransformation of the neurotoxic plasticiser n-butylbenzenesulfonamide (NBBS) were studied in order that the human health risk due to environmental exposure to NBBS could be evaluated. The pharmacokinetics of NBBS was determined in Wistar rats, following intravenous administration of the isotopomer [13C6] NBBS (1 mg/kg in 0.9% saline).  [13C6] NBBS is cleared from plasma at a rate of 5 ml/min by the liver.  The plasticiser has a short distribution phase (t1/2 of 47 seconds) and a long terminal phase (t1/2 of 17 hours).  Plasma [13C6] NBBS concentrations, 24 hours after administration, represented 0.04% of the administered dose.  These data indicated rapid uptake into tissue, which was subsequently confirmed by monitoring tissue concentrations of [13C6] NBBS for upto 8 hours following administration.  [13C6] NBBS was not accumulated by any of the tissues studied (brain, liver, kidney, muscle and adipose tissue). Oral bioavailability was determined by simultaneously administering native NBBS orally and [13C6] NBBS intravenously to Wistar rats.  The plasticiser was found to be absorbed erratically and subject to first pass metabolism.  Plasma concentrations of orally administered NBBS fluctuated over the duration of the experiment.  Furthermore, limitations posed by the assay resulted in truncated oral curves.  These factors precluded estimation of areas under the oral NBBS curves to infinity and partial area ratios were instead used to calculate absolute bioavailability (mean of 19%). Cerebrovascular permeability of NBBS was determined with [13C6] NBBS, in Sprague-Dawley rats, using the in-situ brain perfusion technique of Takasato et al. (1984).  The uptake of [13C6] NBBS into brain was very rapid and flow limited.  Assuming an average cerebral perfusion fluid flow rate of 0.11 ml/s/g, the calculated single pass extraction value for [13C6] NBBS is 99.9% with a Kin of 0.11 ml/s/g.  This is in close agreement with experimental values for the 15 second saline perfusions (extraction = 98% - 125% and Kin = 0.108 - 0.137).  Differences in regional brain distribution of the plasticiser were not found. In-vitro biotransformation studies revealed one phase I metabolite in incubates of NBBS containing human, rabbit and rat post-mitochondrial supernatant (S9 fraction).

The study details the methods infection control practitioners use to co-ordinate and measure nosocomial infections as clinical outcomes of Australian infection surveillance and control programs. Administrators' and clinicians' perceptions of the elements and infrastructure of infection surveillance and control programs and the role of the infection control were measured in 316 hospitals in New South Wales, Australia.  A literature review found that the development of Australian infection surveillance and control programs is behind that of U.S.A and the United Kingdom. The survey of the infection control practitioners identified that their role and duties varied between facilities as did the time allocated to infection control tasks. The survey of infection control practitioners demonstrated variation in their levels of skill, education and experience. Infection control practitioners' use and application of evidence and associated skills was examined and found to be limited in relation to clinical decision making and policy development. The survey also examined the methods infection control practitioners use to undertake surveillance of nosocomial infections. The methods reported indicated non-standard approaches to surveillance activity.  A survey of administrators and clinicians in NSW hospitals was undertaken to identify variation in administrator and clinician perceptions and to describe their level of support for recommended essential infrastructure and criteria for infection surveillance and control programs and the role of the infection control practitioner in accordance with Scheckler's model. The survey indicated divergent views regarding the role of the infection control practitioner and the essential elements of infection surveillance and control programs.  The study identified that education of infection control practitioners is necessary to facilitate standard approaches to co-ordinating infection surveillance and control activity. The development of Australian infection surveillance and control programs require a strategic alliance between stakeholders. to define essential elements of infection surveillance and control programs. In addition, the role of the infection control practitioner must be defined before key stakeholders can agree on the minimum skills, qualifications and experience required by an infection control practitioner.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public health</field><field name="subject">Medical care</field><field name="subject">Communicable diseases</field><field name="subject">Disease prevention</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A SIMULTANEOUS MEASUREMENT OF THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION, MASS AND KINETIC ENERGY OF 235U   AND   232Th FISSION FRAGMENTS</field><field name="creator">EL-HAJJE, REFAAT, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Simultaneous measurements of the angular distribution, mass distribution and average total kinetic energy of fission fragments produced by the neutron-induced fission of 235U and 232Th have been made using a gridded ionisation chamber.

The results indicate that there is no interdependence between the angular and mass distributions of fragments for 235U(n,f) and for 232Th(n,f). The angular distribution of 235U fission fragments showed an anisotropy of less than one for En below 150 keV. For 232Th, the expected minimum in the anisotropy near En = 1.6 MeV was confirmed.  No evidence for a third peak in the mass symmetry region of 232Th(n,f) was observed, within the yield sensitivity limitation of the chamber. Fine structure was observed in the mass yield distributions for 235U(n,f) and 232Th(n,f) at mass locations predicted by theory. The fission fragment average total kinetic energy for 235U(n,f) and 232Th(n,f) showed no significant dependence on the excitation energy of the fissioning nucleus. Possible reasons for some of these results are advanced.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fission products Analysis</field><field name="subject">Nuclear fission</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality of life of adults with spina bifida: an issue of equality</field><field name="creator">Bowles, Wendy Lyn, School of Social Work, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the quality of life of the first generation of people with spina bifida to reach adulthood.  The inquiry was conducted from the social/political approach to disability.  From this perspective, disability is viewed as a matter of equality because the problems associated with having a disability are caused by barriers within the social environment.  This human rights-based approach underlies much current Australian legislation and government disability policy.  The research question was: do adults with spina bifida in New South Wales have the same quality of life as other adults in New South Wales?  Quality of life was examined using a framework incorporating objective and subjective measures of quality of life, and the relationship between them, in thirteen domains of life.  The role played by values was also explored.  Qualitative and quantitative data were collected.  Results from structured interviews with a stratified random sample of 117 adults with spina bifida were compared with the results of postal surveys from 180 Technical and Further Education students.  1991 Census data was also used for comparison.  People with spina bifida were found to be disadvantaged in every area of life studied, being in the lowest categories of quality of life:  'adaptation' or 'reluctant adaptation' for nearly all domains.  In this situation the spina bifida group had significantly lower objective life conditions than the comparison group, yet were as satisfied or more so, with these circumstances, having adapted their expectations downwards.  Qualitative results revealed that people with spina bifida suffered high levels of discrimination, social exclusion and isolation.  They wanted jobs, leisure opportunities, relationships and to form their own families.  Having little hope of attaining these, however, they had become resigned to their disadvantaged situations. It is concluded that there is a large gap between current Australian disability policy rhetoric about rights and equity, and the reality for people with disabilities.  It is also demonstrated that measurements of quality of life which take into account both objective and subjective indicators and the relationship between them, are vital for service planning and evaluation.  Implications for future research, policy and practice conclude the thesis.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spina bifida</field><field name="subject">quality of life</field><field name="subject">adult</field><field name="subject">social work</field><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MANAGEMENT DISCOURSE AND PRACTICE IN AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, James Ian, School of Sociology, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis sought to place the development of managers, management theory, practice and discourse within its general historical context. The emergence and growth of a body of managers in Australia was examined utilising Historical Sociology, Survey, Content Analysis and Theory of Practices methods. Australian managers, management practice and discourse were influenced by British, American and, more recently, Japanese management theories and practices. Theories and practices from Classical Management and subsequent theories were evidenced as trends which dominated for periods, changing the practices and discourses of managers. Based on a survey of Australian managers, the interaction between management theories and practices was examined and interpreted. Counter trends existed in periods that were dominated by particular theoretical models. These counter trends provided the links to newer practices and theories. The results indicated the continued importance of all theoretical models and the practices they describe. In Australia, the theoretical perspectives did not fit the trends of broad cycles of economic activity but overlapped, having been introduced in differing time frames. Management discourse was evaluated through content analysis of the editorials of Rydge's (a local management magazine) from 1945 to 1987 to ascertain any changes in management discourse as the result of the introduction of new management theories. Other themes and trends were identified and examined to provide insights into managers' values. The production and reproduction of practices were considered utilising a Theory of Practice. In the field of management, practices are produced and reproduced by managers influenced by their habitus, the division of labour and the exercise of power. The survey and content analysis results were examined to profile the habitus through the impact of managers' backgrounds on their behaviour, practice and discourse. These constituted forms of cultural capital which mediated managers' beliefs through symbolic instruments embedded in its structuring structures. Overall, the research highlighted relationships between typologies of management theories, discourses and practices and provided a profile of the production and reproduction of practices in a contemporary Australian setting.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Management Australia</field><field name="subject">Executives Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Study of Biomarkers of Protein Oxidative Damage and Aging by Mass Spectrometry</field><field name="creator">Yi, Dong-Hui, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The physiologically important free radicals, nitrogen monoxide and superoxide, can combine to form the reactive intermediate peroxynitrite.  Peroxynitrite can react with proteins and their constituent amino acids, such as tyrosine, resulting in protein peroxidation, oxidation and nitration.  The nitration of proteins, assessed by the analysis of 3-nitrotyrosine, is a proposed index of pathophysiological activity of peroxynitrite. The aim of the work was to investigate the reaction products between peroxynitrite and protein, develop an assay for 3-nitrotyrosine and measure its levels in biological samples. To study the amino acid products arising from the reaction of peroxynitrite and protein, both liquid chromatography (LC) and gas chromatography (GC) combined with mass spectrometry (MS) were adopted.  Approaches to 3-nitrotyrosine assay development were first, to take advantage of the intrinsic sensitivity of electron capture negative ionization GC-MS.  Secondly, to avoid possible artefactual problems associated with the derivatisation step in GC-MS, an assay for 3-nitrotyrosine based on combined LC-MS-MS was developed.  When a selection of peptides was exposed to peroxynitrite under physiological conditions in vitro, the hydrolysis products showed that 3-nitrotyrosine was the major product.  Detectable minor products were 3,5-dinitrotyrosine and DOPA.  The GC-MS assay was found to be fraught with difficulty due to artefactual formation of 3-nitrotyrosine.  In order to quantify and correct for artefact formation, this complication was approached by incorporating a second isotopomer. This method, however, was confounded by large errors that reduced the overall sensitivity.  Either negative or zero levels of endogenous 3-nitrotyrosine were found in tested samples after correction for artefact formation.  The LC-MS-MS assay was then used to analyse 3-nitrotyrosine levels in a range of biological samples, including human plasma from healthy volunteers, synovial fluid samples from arthritis patients and tissue extracts from a mouse model of amyotropic lateral sclerosis.  In contrast to published data, 3-nitrotyrosine levels were found to be below the limit of detection (1 pg/????L, 10 pg o/c) for all samples - a result somewhat consistent with the negative GC-MS data.  It is suggested that the high 3-nitrotyrosine levels previously reported in the literature might reflect artefactual generation of 3-nitrotyrosine and that other approaches to assessing pathophysiological nitration should be sought in future.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proteins Oxidation</field><field name="subject">Mass spectrometry</field><field name="subject">Physiological oxidation</field><field name="subject">Biochemical markers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Compact Group Actions and Harmonic Analysis</field><field name="creator">Chung, Kin Hoong, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">A large part of the structure of the objects in the theory of Dooley and Wildberger [Funktsional.

It briefly traces the origins of the term in the mediaeval liturgical drama and the history of its critical usage. Contemporary criticism of the genre rests upon the common, though ill-defined, understanding that farce is a specific form of comedy and that certain distinguishing characteristics are associated with plays which may be described as farces; although farcical techniques and scenes of farce may also be utilized by other comic forms for their own dramatic purposes. Some of those characteristics are examined in detail -- farce's exclusive concern with laughter and its lack, as a genre, of any more serious dramatic purpose; its spirit of festive liberation; its obscenity and its essential conservatism; its irregularity and improbability in plot structure; its dependence upon predictable co-incidence and other mechanical patterns of events; its use of stock, or 'type' characters and its association with masks; its exploitation of visual comedy and its relationship to the actor's art. Brief historical outlines are given of the chief period of farce in the European theatre, between the development of the Graeco-Roman stages and the close of the nineteenth century. These range from the crude and traditional folk-performances and the buffooneries of the fairground and the boulevarde to the sophisticated 'manners-farce', the vaudeville and the 'naturalistic' farces constructed in the style of the 'well-made play'. From the most popular and best-known pieces of these different periods a total of twenty-four plays is taken for detailed discussion. The analysis of each deals firstly with the broad structure of the plot, with the targets of the aggression in the play and with the pattern of resolution of the conflict. Secondly, it examines within that structure the use of recurring mechanical devices or motifs, such as those identified by Bergson, Hughes, Bentley and others: repetition, reversals, disguise and trickery, physical violence, mental and physical 'fixations' in the characters and so forth. Given this approach, which sets aside particular concern with wit and verbal comedy, some of the plays are studied in English translation after careful comparison with the original text.  From these analyses it is apparent that the mechanical devices invest both the broad structure of the plot and the individual farce-scenes with a fundamental balance between the opposing forces in the farcical conflict. This balance is achieved in different ways for different structures depending upon the complexity of the conflict. In the plays in which a single rebellious impulse carries the conflict forward, the rigidity of the victim restores him a the resolution to his position of authority. In others, the aggressors suffer a specific reversal and the action is resolved in a draw between the two sides.  In others, the victims directly earn their humiliation by their own repressive action and the aggressions are equally balanced from the outset. In still others, the mechanical devices are applied so minutely that they remind the audience at all times that aggressors victims alike are puppets reacting to interventions beyond their control. A pattern of co-incidence visible only to the audience may be invoked to overwhelm all the characters with a mutual humiliation.  Farce proclaims its own characters; but when such a rule is allied to sympathetic and human characterization and to a serious social concern, the result may be that farcical techniques powerfully serve some other dramatic purpose.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">farce</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">European theatre</field><field name="subject">vaudeville</field><field name="subject">comedy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17783</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Saturation-Dependent Dissipation Source Function for Wind-Wave Modelling Applications</field><field name="creator">Alves, Jose Henrique Gomes de Mattos, Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study reports on a new formulation of the spectral dissipation source term Sds for wind-wave modelling applications. This new form of Sds features a nonlinear dependence on the local wave spectrum, expressed in terms of the azimuthally integrated saturation parameter B(k)=k^4 F(k). The basic form of this saturation-dependent Sds is based on a new framework for the onset of deep-water wave breaking due to the nonlinear modulation of wave groups. The new form of Sds is succesfully validated through numerical experiments that include exact nonlinear computations of fetch-limited wind-wave evolution and hindcasts of two-dimensional wave fields made with an operational wind-wave model. The newly-proposed form of Sds generates integral spectral parameters that agree more closely with observations when compared to other dissipation source terms used in state-of-the-art wind-wave models. It also provides more flexibility in controlling properties of the wave spectrum within the high wavenumber range. Tests using a variety of wind speeds, three commonly-used wind input source functions and two alternative full-development evolution limits further demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of the new saturation-dependent dissipation source term. Finally, improved wave hindcasts obtained with an implementation of the new form of Sds in a version of the WAM model demonstrate its potential usefulness in operational wind-wave forecasting applications.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wind-waves</field><field name="subject">wave forecasting</field><field name="subject">wave models</field><field name="subject">air-sea interactions</field><field name="subject">wave breaking</field><field name="subject">physical oceanography</field><field name="subject">ocean waves</field><field name="subject">ocean-atmosphere interaction</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring spirituality in feminist practices - emerging knowledge for social work</field><field name="creator">Coholic, Diana, School of Social Work, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research study investigates self-identified feminist social workers??? conceptualizations of spirituality, how spirituality influences their practices, and their ideas about the effects of spiritually influenced practice. There is increasing interest in exploring and considering spirituality across social work approaches, accompanied by a strong demand for empirical research and the development of knowledge in this area. The past few years in particular have witnessed an expanding social work literature that discusses the incorporation of spirituality into practice. In this thesis spirituality refers to a complex construct that can be deeply personal and/or communal, and that can encompass a sense of connection with something bigger that transcends ordinary life experience. In order to examine spirituality in the context of feminist social work practice, the goals of this study needed to be exploratory and demanded the use of a qualitative methodology. In-depth individual interviews were conducted with twenty experienced direct practice social workers. Grounded theory analysis of the interview data uncovered surprising and significant convergences amongst research participants??? beliefs, values and practices. These unexpected commonalities invited a further analysis of the data that produced a set of practice principles. These practice principles reflected the participants??? understandings of spirituality and basic values, their ideas about processes of spiritual development and beliefs about the spiritual essence of human life, and their spiritually influenced practice methods and relationships. The process of developing practice principles included further data collection through the written feedback of participants and the use of three focus groups. This second round of data collection and analysis extended and refined the practice principles. The practice principles are particularly relevant for social work because they are based in the participants??? collective practice wisdom and represent an important step towards helping to legitimize spiritual knowledge. The practice principles also have important implications for social work practice, education and research in that they can promote discussions about spirituality, guide practice, provide a base for the future development of spiritually influenced models and frameworks, and direct curriculum development.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spirituality</field><field name="subject">feminist practices</field><field name="subject">feminists</field><field name="subject">religious life</field><field name="subject">social service</field><field name="subject">religious aspects</field><field name="subject">social workers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17873</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis, purification and micronisation of copper indomethacin using dense gas technology</field><field name="creator">Warwick, Barry, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this work was to provide an alternative method of synthesis of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug copper indomethacin (Cu-Indo) and to produce alternative forms of the drug to increase its marketability. Dense gases as anti-solvents were used to achieve these aims. The study involved the synthesis, purification, micronisation and co-precipitation of Cu-Indo with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) using dense carbon dioxide as an anti-solvent. Initially the volumetric and solubility behaviours of the solvent???anti-solvent systems were investigated to determine the optimum processing conditions. The solubility of Cu-Indo in an expanded solution was found to be a complex function of the solvent and other solutes. Copper indomethacin was successfully synthesised and purified in a single vessel using dense carbon dioxide as an anti-solvent. Drug yields of 98 % and purities near 100 % were achieved at optimum conditions with the advantages of less residual solvent in the drug, less solvent waste, reduced processing time and increased yields over the conventional synthesis process. Copper indomethacin was produced in a variety of morphologies and particle sizes using dense carbon dioxide as an anti-solvent. An investigation of the effect of process parameters on the particle characteristics showed that solute concentration was the dominant variable. Spherical particles with diameters less than 8 mm were obtained at optimum conditions. The immediate benefit of micronising Cu-Indo was demonstrated with an eight fold increase in dissolution rate when compared to the conventionally produced drug. Polyvinylpyrrolidone was successfully co-precipitated with Cu-Indo using dense carbon dioxide as an anti-solvent. The PVP???Cu-Indo co-precipitates were found to increase the solubility of the drug in ethanol with a 36 fold solubility enhancement at optimum conditions.  The use of dense carbon dioxide as anti-solvent in this work demonstrates the potential of the GAS and ASES processes in the pharmaceutical industry. Copper indomethacin was synthesised, purified and micronised in a single vessel at a substantial saving in terms of time and solvent usage. The micronisation of Cu-Indo and the formation of the PVP???Cu-Indo co-precipitate provided alternative forms of the drug substantially increasing its marketability.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indomethacin</field><field name="subject">Copper</field><field name="subject">Therapeutic use</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17876</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of deregulation on financial market efficiency in Sri Lanka</field><field name="creator">Cooray, Arusha, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of  deregulation on financial market   efficiency in Sri Lanka.  The concept of efficiency used here is due to Fama (1970) who defines an efficient market  as one in which prices fully reflect all available information.  Given the significant expansion of Sri Lanka???s financial markets in the post deregulation period,   efficiency is investigated in the context of these  markets.  To this end,  the study employs a  number of standard tests for market efficiency including; the expectations hypothesis of the term structure, the Fisher hypothesis, uncovered interest parity, speculative efficiency,   real interest rate equalization and tests of capital mobility.  Although the overall results presented in this study  suggest  that Sri Lanka???s financial markets are not fully efficient, the evidence provides significant insight to the performance of these markets.  The main policy lesson to be learnt from this analysis  is that financial deregulation   will not automatically promote market efficiency unless accompanied by positive policy action to reinforce the impact of these reforms.  In conclusion  therefore, the study makes a number of recommendations which could help to reinforce the impact of financial deregulation on market efficiency.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Financial institutions</field><field name="subject">Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">Deregulation</field><field name="subject">Money market</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Needlestick injury in health care workers in Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Shiao, Judith Shu-Chu, School of Health Services Management, UNSW</field><field name="description">Objectives: Risk associated with needlestick injuries (NSI) in health care workers (HCWs) in Taiwan has not been characterized.  We conducted this investigation to study 1) the prevalence and yearly incidence of NSI in HCWs in Taiwan, and the risk factors associated with NSIs; 2) reporting behavior when a NSI was sustained; and 3) seroprevalence of blood-borne pathogens among inpatients. Combination of the above information allowed for risk estimation for contracting hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in HCWs. Methodology: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey for life-time experience and frequency of NSI was conducted in a random sample from four strata of accredited hospitals according to the number of employees, from July 1996 to June 1997 in Taiwan. All full time employees, including physicians, nurses, technicians, and supporting personnel were recruited.  Seroprevalence was examined for HBV, HCV and HIV among inpatients six years in age or older in one teaching hospital during July 1997 to June 1998. Results: A total of 10,469 health care workers were recruited from 16 out of 132 accredited hospitals and 82.6% (8,645) completed the survey, including nurses (61.0%), physicians (16.1%), medical technicians (14.9%), supporting personnel (7.9%). The prevalence of NSI were 93.1%, 86.6%, 78.3%, 61.0% in nurses, physicians, technicians, and supporting personnel respectively. The reported incidence of needlestick and other sharps injuries was 1.30 and 1.21 times per person in the past 12 months. Of the most recent episodes of NSIs, ordinary syringe needles accounted for 80.3% (95% CI, 79.4% - 81.2%) of hollow-bore needles associated incidents, and 74.1% (95% CI, 72.8% - 75.4%) of them were contaminated. The most frequently reported circumstance was the "Breakdown of Universal Precautions", recapping-related behaviors (81.6%, 95% CI 80.3% - 82.9%) of HCWs. More than a quarter (27.8%, 2,399) of HCWs were unprotected (either not vaccinated or having an unknown serological status) against HBV. Seroconversion in stuck HCWs was reported 1.8% for HBV (135), 0.2% (18) for HCV, 0.2% (15) for both HBV and HCV, 0.1% (5) for syphilis and less than 0.1% (2) for HIV. ^M A total of 81.8% of NSIs were unreported. Similarly, high incidence of NSI and low reporting rate were also found in student nurses.  Seroprevalence of HBV, HCV, and HIV among inpatients were found higher than the reported rate in source patients of this survey. Seroprevalence of HBsAg was 16.7% in hospitalized patients, 1.7% positive for HBeAg, 12.7% for Anti-HCV, and 0.8% for Anti-HIV. Different seroprevalence rates of HBsAb (+), HBsAg (+), Anti-HCV (+), Anti-HIV (+) in different seasons were also found significant (p&lt;0.001). The risk of seroconversion to HBV was thus estimated to be 0.003 ~ 0.008 time per person-year, HCV 0.003 ~ 0.007 per person-year, and HIV 0.4 ~ 1.2 /100, 000 person-year. Considering the number of HCWs in Taiwan, a total of 330 ~ 917 HCWs will seroconvert to HBV (+) in a year, 330 ~ 880 HCWs seroconvert to HCV (+), and less than one to two HCWs seroconvert to HIV (+). Conclusions: Needlestick and sharps injuries were highly prevalent among Taiwanese HCW and across job categories. Risk of seroconversion is real and significant.  Preventive measures are warranted for reduction of contracting blood-borne pathogens in HCWs in Taiwan.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medical personnel</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="subject">Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Needlestick injuries</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17829</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The professional life-cycles and professional development of adult teachers of English to speakers of other languages (TESOL)</field><field name="creator">Waites, Carol Katherine, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">THE PROFESSIONAL LIFE-CYCLES AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF ADULT TEACHERS OF ENGLISH TO SPEAKERS OF OTHER LANGUAGES (TESOL)  This thesis focuses on the findings of a research study conducted in Geneva and Sydney to examine the career cycles of TESOLs.  It explores many of the issues investigated in Huberman???s study of 160 secondary school teachers in Geneva (1989, 1993).  Seventy-three in-depth interviews were conducted with teachers and trainers / administrators in adult TESOL, and professional development issues were examined in greater detail than in the Huberman study.  The central purpose of the study was to test the universality of the Huberman model of career phases.  TESOLs were found to have far more variations during their career cycles than school teachers, who were in a more stable and predictable situation.  The study focused on particular moments in the career cycle, exploring TESOLs??? levels of satisfaction.  TESOLs in the present study were found to have similar intrinsic satisfactions and concerns about working conditions as the findings of other TESOL studies.  Although the occupation was reportedly becoming increasingly more professional, its unpredictable nature made it stimulating and rewarding.  In spite of the instability of the TESOL career, TESOLs appeared to have more positive career experiences overall than many school teachers with more stable career paths.  The study also examined professional development issues by comparing the perceptions of TESOLs and their trainers / administrators.  They had many divergent opinions as to the professional development requirements of TESOLs.  While there was no conclusive evidence that professional development could be linked to stages, TESOLs in a phase of diversification were found to have different professional development requirements from other phases.  Personal, professional and environmental factors also affect the professional development requirements of TESOLs at any stage.  In summary, it appears that the traditional career phase model is inappropriate when applied to TESOLs, and perhaps for other similarly unstable careers.  With the recent changes in people???s professional lives, requiring increasing mobility and adaptability in the changing job market, other career path models to guide counselling, professional development and other staff management programs will need to be explored.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Career development</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">English teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17832</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis of advanced " special pair " models for the photosynthetic reaction centre</field><field name="creator">Mecker, Christoph J, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Multi-step photoinduced electron transfer takes place over a large distance in the photosynthetic reaction centres (PRCs). Electron donor in this life-spending event is the photo-excited 'special pair', a unit of two electronically coupled porphyrinoid chromophores. Bacteriopheophytin and two quinone molecules function as electron acceptors and contribute to the charge separation with almost unit quantum efficiency.  The natural photosynthetic reaction centre is the most sophisticated molecular electronic device to date and interest is high in increasing our understanding of the basic quantum mechanical principles behind efficient electron transfer and ultimately copying Nature and construct similar efficient devices.  Two main approaches towards a better understanding of the mechanisms involved have been taken. The more biological disciplines isolate, cultivate and alternate reaction centres whereas synthetic chemists prefer to construct well-defined models that mimic certain aspects of the reaction centres. Such a synthetic approach is described in the 'Synthesis of Advanced 'Special Pair' Models for the Photosynthetic Reaction Centre'.  The aspect to be mimicked is the 'special pair'. One or two porphyrins in a well-defined spatial disposition (kinked or non-kinked in respect to each other) were to act as electron donor in rigid bichromophoric and trichromophoric systems. A tetracyanonaphthoquinodimethane (TCNQ) unit was employed as the electron acceptor in the series of dyads synthesised. The TCNQ acceptor was replaced by a naphthoquinone (NQ) primary acceptor covalently linked to a TCNQ secondary electron acceptor in the series of triads. Rigid norbornylogous bridges held the chromophores in place and Diels-Alder methodology as well as condensation reactions were applied to link donor, bridge and acceptor components.    Despite larger interchromophoric separation than in the natural 'special pair', the two porphyrin chromophores of the series of 'special pair' dyads show some interaction and thereby prove the success of our approach towards 'special pair' mimics. Strong fluorescence quenching in the porphyrin-TCNQ dyads indicates the sought after electron transfer process.  A number of synthetic problems experienced and overcome in the synthesis of the series of triads led to discovery of a one-step 'bis-ketonisation' from an olefin under Sharpless bis-hydroxylation conditions with N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide. High pressure was applied to circumvent a lack of reactivity in the condensation reaction used to attach the porphyrin moieties (one or two) to the donor backbone. For the linkage of donor, bridge and acceptor component, a procedure was developed and successfully applied to give the giant mono-porphyrin-NQ-TCNQ trichromophore. In a similar manner 'special pair' trichromophoric systems should be available as part of future work.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electron donor acceptor complexes</field><field name="subject">Charge exchange</field><field name="subject">Porphyrins</field><field name="subject">Quinone</field><field name="subject">Charge transfer in biology</field><field name="subject">Molecular electronics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Production and regulation of fouling inhibitory compounds by the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas tunicata</field><field name="creator">Egan, Suhelen, Microbiology &amp; Immunology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The marine surface-associated bacterium Pseudoaltermonas tunicata, produces a range of compounds that inhibit fouling organisms, including invertebrate larvae, bacteria, algal spores and fungi.  In addition to these antifouling compounds P. tunicata cells produce both a yellow and a purple pigment.  The aim of this study was to further characterise the antifouling activities, their regulation and relationship with pigmentation, and the ecological significance of P. tunicata and related organisms.  It was discovered that the anti-algal compound was extracellular, heat sensitive, polar and between 3 and 10 kDa in size.  The anti-fungal compound was found to be the yellow pigment and active against a wide range of fungal and yeast isolates.  Chemical analysis suggests that this compound consists of a carbon ring bound to a fatty-acid side chain.  Genetic analysis supports the chemical data for the active compound as a mutant in a gene encoding for a long-chain fatty-acid CoA ligase was deficient for anti-fungal activity.  To address the regulation of antifouling compounds and their relationship to pigmentation transposon mutagenesis of P. tunicata was performed.  Mutants lacking the yellow pigment displayed a reduced ability to inhibit fouling organisms.  Further analysis of these mutants identified genes involved with the synthesis and regulation of synthesis of pigment and antifouling compounds.  One of these mutants was disrupted in a gene (wmpR) with similarity to the transcriptional regulators ToxR from Vibrio cholerae and CadC from Escherichia coli.  Analysis of global protein expression using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that WmpR is essential for the expression of at least fifteen proteins important for the synthesis of fouling inhibitors.  The ecological significance of antifouling bacteria was addressed by assessing the antifouling capabilities of a collection of bacteria isolated from different marine surfaces.  Overall, isolates from living surfaces displayed more antifouling traits then strains isolated from non-living surfaces.  Five dark-pigmented strains originating from the alga Ulva lactuca were further studied.  Phylogenetic and phenotypic analysis revealed that they were all members of the genus Pseudoalteromonas and were closely related to P. tunicata.  Two strains represented a novel species within the genus and were taxonomically defined as P. ulvae sp. nov.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biofouling</field><field name="subject">Marine bacteria</field><field name="subject">antifouling</field><field name="subject">antialgal metabolites</field><field name="subject">antifungal metabolites</field><field name="subject">bacterial secondary metabolites</field><field name="subject">bacterial pigments</field><field name="subject">fouling</field><field name="subject">fouling organisms</field><field name="subject">pseudoanemoniaceae</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17838</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative criteria for the selection and stabilisation of soils for rammed earth wall construction</field><field name="creator">Burroughs, Van Stephan, School of the Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">Modern building procedures and requirements demand that the selection and stabilisation of soils for the purposes of rammed earth construction be better quantified.  This study examines the relationships between soil properties, stabiliser treatments, and stabilised strength and density for 111 soil samples taken from sites in New South Wales (Australia), and develops new quantitative criteria for soil assessment, selection, and stabilisation.  Laboratory measurements of soil particle size distribution, plasticity, and shrinkage were made for each soil.  Various quantities from 0-6 % of lime, cement, and asphalt were added to the soil samples, and the resulting 230 specimens were compacted, and cured for 28 days.  Determinations were made of the optimum moisture content, maximum dry density, and compressive strength of the stabilised material.  The samples showed stabilised strengths ranging from 1.0-5.4 MPa, with a mean of 2.62 MPa, and densities from 1.44-2.21 t/m3, with a mean of 1.86 t/m3.  The results show that over 90 % of the variation in stabilised strength and density of the samples is due to variation in soil properties, with differences in stabiliser type or stabiliser quantity being relatively minor.  The most important soil properties explaining stabilised strength are linear shrinkage and plasticity index.  These properties have been used to categorise the soils into three groups on the basis of their suitability for stabilisation as measured against a compressive strength criterion of 2 MPa.  Favourable soils have shrinkages of &amp;lt 7.1 % and plasticities of &amp;lt 16 %, and 90 % of these samples passed the 2 MPa criterion.  Satisfactory soils have shrinkages of 7.1-13.0 % and plasticities of 16-30 %, and 65 % of these samples had strengths in excess of 2 MPa.  Unfavourable soils have shrinkages of &amp;gt 13 % and plasticities of &amp;gt 30 %, and only 10 % of these samples exceeded the 2 MPa value.  Soils in the favourable and satisfactory categories can be further discriminated using textural information.  On that basis, all soils classified as favourable, and those classified as satisfactory and which also have sand contents &amp;lt 60 %, are recommended as being suitable for stabilisation.  Soils not fulfilling these criteria are unlikely to be successfully stabilised and should be rejected.  	These results stress the importance of selecting a soil favourably predisposed to stabilisation.  Field techniques to search for such soils could be refined on the basis of the new soil criteria presented.  Use of the criteria should also minimise unnecessary laboratory testing of the density and strength of soils that subsequently prove unsuitable for stabilisation.  A flow chart is presented to guide practitioners through the different stages of soil testing, assessment, and rammed earth stabilisation.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil stabilization</field><field name="subject">Pise</field><field name="subject">Building Adobe</field><field name="subject">Walls Design and construction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17861</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Substrates of Transgression: A ??i??ekian Account of  Four Iceberg Slim Novellas</field><field name="creator">Cleveland, Matthew, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">The writings of controversial ???underground??? figure Iceberg Slim feature identities and sub-cultures either antagonistic to, or otherwise not commensurable with, mainstream American Orders of Discourse. Within the ex-pimp???s narrative dystopia, a provocative and unreservedly profane idiom is employed not only to champion normatively marginalized or demonized subjectivities (such as African-Americans, the underclass, pimps and ???hustlers???), but also to identify and condemn the policies and praxes hegemonizing the Social domain. Moreover, although Slim is one of the most widely-read African-American authors, there has been to date almost no critical engagement with his work. The two primary objectives of this Thesis were: firstly, to evaluate and elucidate the transgressive potential posed by the Slimian narrative universe; and secondly, to demonstrate that the genus of Lacanian, post-Marxian and other dialectical heuristics developed by Slavoj ??i??ek offered the most expedient means of achieving the first objective. More specifically, via investigating the discursive and trans-discursive coordinates of marginal identity as dramatized in four of Slim???s most popular novellas (Pimp, Trick Baby, Mama Black Widow, and Death Wish), we sought to ascertain the degree to which Slim???s particular representational negotiations of identity and identification operate to undermine, or (inadvertently) support, dominant ideological formulations. Further, this investigation adopted a ??i??ekian approach to develop a framework through which the (social, ethical, ideological, aesthetic, psychical and libidinal) issues surrounding Power that are at stake could be meaningfully evaluated. Our cardinal hypotheses concerned the basic dialectical postulation that the key to understanding hegemonic operations lies not in the content of those operations, but rather in the form(s) through which they are brought to bear.  The results obtained in this Thesis were consistent with the fundamental hypotheses posed and served also to achieve our primary objectives. Namely, our ??i??ekian approach identified and explained various structural and psychical features which were crucial in determining not only the antagonisms between (and inherent to) the vicissitudes of Power and the metastases of Its transgression (or not) within the Slimian universe, but also our apprehension of those antagonisms. In our enumeration of at least three discreet modalities of transgression, we finally concluded that the most radical dimension of the Slimian universe was to be located in the inherent undecidability between its affiliations with incommensurable ideological domains.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Iceberg Slim 1918</field><field name="subject">Zizek Slavoj</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17864</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and Testing of Augmentations of Continuously-Operating GPS Networks to Improve Their Spatial and Temporal Resolution</field><field name="creator">Ge, Linlin, School of Geomatic Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Continuously-operating networks of GPS receivers (CGPS) are not capable of determining the characteristics of crustal deformation at the fine temporal or spatial scales required. Four ???temporal densification schemes??? and two 'spatial densification schemes' to augment the CGPS networks have been developed and tested. The four ???temporal densification schemes??? are based on the high rate Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS technique, GPS multipath effects, Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR). The 'serial scheme' based on using GPS as a seismometer has been proposed. Simulated seismic signals have been extracted from the very noisy high rate RTK-GPS results using an adaptive filter based on the least-mean-square algorithm. They are in very good agreement with those of the collocated seismometers. This scheme can improve the CGPS temporal resolution to 0.1 second. The 'retro-active scheme' takes advantage of the fact that the GPS multipath disturbance is repeated between consecutive days. It can therefore provide a means of correcting multipath errors in the observation data themselves. A reduction of the standard deviations of the pseudo-range and carrier phase multipath time series to about one fourth and one half the original values respectively, has been demonstrated. The 'all-GPS parallel scheme' uses the multipath effects as a signal to monitor the antenna environment. Models relating the changes of multipath and antenna environment have been derived. The 'cross-technique parallel scheme' integrates the collocated CGPS, VLBI and SLR results, taking advantage of the decorrelation among their biases and errors. Crustal displacement signature has been extracted as a common-mode signal using data from two stations: Matera in Italy and Wettzell in Germany. Two 'spatial densification schemes' which can verify with each other have been developed and tested. The 'soft' scheme integrates CGPS with radar interferometry (InSAR). The Double Interpolation and Double Prediction (DIDP) approach combines the strengths of the high temporal resolution of CGPS and the high spatial resolution possible with the InSAR technique. This scheme can improve the spatial resolution to about 25m. The 'hard' scheme requires the deployment of single-frequency receivers to in-fill the present CGPS arrays. Alternatively some receivers may be installed at some geophysically strategic sites outside existing CGPS arrays. The former has been tested within Japan's GEONET, while the latter has been tested using a five-station array.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Global Positioning System</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17867</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How the bananas got their pyjamas: A study of the metamorphosis of preschoolers' spontaneous singing as viewed through Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development</field><field name="creator">Whiteman, Peter John, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">Throughout childhood, children experience the social semiotic of music in a variety of ways.  As they sing, dance, move, and play, they enjoy making and listening to music.  Childhood is also a time of immense change.  During their early years, children grow and develop at a faster rate than at any other time in their lives, displaying an intense proliferation of ways of knowing about the world.  As part of the industrious activity that accompanies this explosion of knowledge, children sing many songs.  It is through sensitive investigation of these songs that we can begin to understand what children know about music, and the place that it is afforded in the social milieux within which they participate. Children???s songs have been the focus of investigation for a number of years, with a range of studies reporting on the manner in which they reflect musical development.  Several researchers have reported on children???s songs from a developmental perspective, while others have focussed on the social and functional contexts of the songs. These various approaches have established some basic principles concerning the development of children???s musical skills and knowledge.  It is accepted that as children mature, they are likely to exhibit changes in their musical understanding and abilities.  However, the diverse range of inquiries that have been undertaken, although rigorous, have resulted in fragmented and irresolute information about the manner in which these changes take place. Research into all areas of children???s development has recently undergone a paradigm shift, with current views focussing on the agency of children and their development within a social context.  Such perspectives view the acquisition of knowledge as a dynamic process that occurs as children interact with others, and therefore place great importance on a range of environments in which this knowledge gain takes place. This thesis reports on a 3-year longitudinal study of eight preschool-aged children who were attending a long day care centre in Sydney.  Regular video-recordings were made of the children???s spontaneous singing during free play, with each child recorded approximately once per month.  Camera tapes were examined and all examples of the participants??? singing were transferred to VHS tapes for transcription and analysis.  The resulting 443 songs were transcribed using Western notation, and each play episode and associated song then coded for musical aspects such as song type, melodic range and level of temporal organisation, as well as social aspects such as song function and social roles taken on by the children.  The notion of social role was informed by Vygotsky???s Zone of Proximal Development.  In addition to base data such as the child???s name and the date of the observation, the resultant dataset was transferred to a qualitative software package (NUD???IST) for subsequent analysis and interpretation. Results of the study indicate that the children used songs for specific purposes, and that patterns of musical development were distinctly different for each child.  While interacting with their playmates, the children used both explicit and implicit tools to acquire and transmit musical signs.  During this process, the status of knowledgeable other was often conferred on a playmate by a less knowledgeable member of the group, and was not solely dependent on chronological age.  The results exhibit some congruence with prior studies, especially those for which the social context of music-making was an important consideration.  The findings expand previous developmentally-based investigations by showing that conceptions based on a unidirectional model of musical development, closely linked to chronological age, need to be refined to consider the diversity of social contexts and generative processes within which children???s musical cultures can be defined. The current study supports a modular conception of musical development allied with recent social reconstructions of childhood.  Some substantiation of previously reported Western musical universals was found in the children???s production of a specific form of chant, and their ability to operate within meaningful musical units such as phrases. The thesis includes a discussion of practical and theoretical implications that arise from the findings.  Several implications for the classroom are offered.  Among the most important are that children???s musical constructions should be utilised as important components of planned teaching and learning experiences, because they are capable of producing sophisticated music if afforded the opportunity to do so.  Careful observation of existing musical knowledge and its incorporation in teachers??? programming will facilitate an efficient and appropriate mode of teaching and learning, based on the needs and interests of the children.  As the children were able to scaffold each other in the process of transmitting and acquiring musical knowledge, it appears advantageous to group them in mixed ages for at least some part of the week.  However, without some intervention on the part of the teacher, it seems that they would likely rely on a fairly restricted collection of scaffolding behaviours.  Additional research is recommended to determine the value of a number of strategies that can be used to meet the musical needs of preschool-aged children beyond the current research site.  Indeed, the outcomes of the study question the importance of striving for a unidirectional model of musical development, immersed in the veil of teleology, and suggest that further research be undertaken in the area of children???s songs, which acknowledges the social agency of children, and their roles in their own musical cultures.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">early childhood</field><field name="subject">music education</field><field name="subject">spontaneous singing</field><field name="subject">Vygotsky</field><field name="subject">Vygotskii</field><field name="subject">preschool children</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface Properties Influencing the Fracture Toughness of Aluminium-Epoxy Joints</field><field name="creator">Rider, Andrew, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis systematically investigates the properties of the aluminium adherend which influence the fracture toughness of aluminium-epoxy adhesive joints in humid environments. The fracture energy of the adhesive joint exposed to a humid environment in comparison with the fracture energy in a dry environment provides a measure of the joint durability. A 500C and 95% relative humidity environment is used to simulate aging of an adhesive joint over several years under normal service conditions.  Initially, surface roughness is found to have a significant influence on the fracture toughness of the adhesive joint in humid conditions. A direct correlation between the bond durability and the angle of deliberately machined micro-roughness in the aluminium surface is determined. Consequently a model is developed which initially has the capacity to describe the bond durability performance. The preparation of aluminium surfaces involves the use of a novel ultramilling tool to produce well defined and controlled surface topography. This work represents the first time surface angles of features in the 1????m to 10????m range have been systematically varied and a direct relationship with bond durability has been determined. The use of surface analytical tools aids in elucidating mechanisms involved in the failure of the adhesive joint and contributes to the development of the stress based diffusion model.  Examination of the aluminium oxide hydration level reveals this property has a negligible effect on the fracture toughness of the aluminium-epoxy joints exposed to humid environments. This information confirms the dominant role of the physical properties of the aluminium surface in determining the adhesive joint durability. This is the first occasion that planer oxide films grown in an RF plasma have had their hydration state adjusted in a controlled manner and their properties subsequently assessed in terms of bond durability properties.  Further alteration of the aluminium surface chemistry is achieved through the application of an organo-silane coupling agent and a series of novel organo-phosphonate compounds. This work further develops the stress based diffusion model developed in conjunction with the micro-machining studies. The components of surface roughness and the ability of interfacial bonds to co-operatively share load are essential for the maintenance of fracture toughness of adhesive joints exposed to humid conditions. The ability of the silane coupling agent to share load through a chemically cross-linked film is a significant property which provides the superior fracture toughness in comparison with the phosphonate treated joints. Although the organo-phosphonate treated aluminium provides hydrolytically more stable bonds than the silane coupling agent, the film is not cross-linked via primary chemical bonds and the reduced load sharing capacity of interfacial bonds increases the bond degradation rate.  The stress based diffusion model evolving from the initial work in the thesis can be used to predict the performance of more complex systems based on a thorough characterisation of the aluminium surface chemistry and topography. The stress based diffusion model essentially describes the concept of the production of micro-cavities at the epoxy-aluminium interface under mode 1 load, as a result of the distribution of strong and weak adhesive bonds. Alternatively, micro-cavities may result from an inhomogeneous stress distribution. In areas where the adhesive bonds are weak, or the local stresses are high, the interfacial load produces larger micro-cavities which provide a path of low resistance for water to diffuse along the bond-line. The water then degrades the adhesive bond either through the displacement of interfacial epoxy bonds or the hydration of the oxide to form a weak barrier layer through which fracture can occur. Alternatively, the water can hydrolyse the adhesive in the interfacial region, leading to cohesive failure of the epoxy resin.  The bond durability performance of a series of complex hydrated oxide films used to pre-treat the aluminium adherend provides support for the stress based diffusion model. Whilst surface area is an important property of the aluminium adherend in producing durable bonding, the best durability achievable, between an epoxy adhesive and aluminium substrate, requires a component of surface roughness which enhances the load sharing capability in the interfacial bonding region. This component of durability performance is predicted by the model. In more specific terms, a boiling water treatment of the aluminium adherend indicates a direct correlation between bond durability, surface area and topography. The characterisation of film properties indicates that the film chemistry does not change as a function of treatment conditions, however, the film topography and surface area does. The overall bond durability performance is linked to both of these properties. The detailed examination of the hydrated oxide film, produced by the boiling water treatment of aluminium, is the first time the bond durability performance has been related to the film topography. It is also the first occasion that the mechanism of film growth has been examined over such a large treatment time. The combination of surface analysis and bond durability measurements is invaluable in confirming the properties, predicted by the stress based diffusion model, which are responsible in forming fracture resistant adhesive bonds in humid conditions.  The bond durability of high surface area and low surface area hydrated oxide films indicates that surface area is an important property. However, this study confirms that the absence of the preferred surface topography limits the ultimate bond durability performance attainable. The fracture toughness measurements performed on aluminium adherends pre-treated with a low surface area film also supports the mechanism of load sharing of interfacial adhesive bonds and its contribution to the overall bond durability. The role performed by the individual molecules and particles in an oxide film is similar to the load sharing performed by the silane coupling agent molecules.  Further support for the stress based diffusion model is provided by films produced on aluminium immersed in nickel salt solutions. The topography of these film alters as a function of treatment time and this is directly related to fracture toughness in humid environments. This work provides the first instance where such films have been characterised in detail and their properties related to bond durability performance. The study is also the first time that the growth mechanism of the film produced on the aluminium substrate has been examined in detail. The film growth mechanism supports the film growth model proposed for the hydrated oxide film produced by the boiling water treatment.  The major findings presented in this thesis are summarised as the direct correlation between surface profile angle, the importance of co-operative load sharing of interfacial adhesive bonds and the relative insignificance of surface oxide hydration in the formation of durable aluminium-epoxy adhesion. This information is used to develop a stress based diffusion model which has the capacity to describe the fracture toughness of a range of aluminium-epoxy adhesive joint systems in humid environments. The stress based diffusion model is also capable of predicting the relative performance of the bond systems examined in the final chapters of the thesis, where complex interfacial oxide films are involved in the formation of adhesive bonds.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Epoxy compounds</field><field name="subject">Adhesive joints</field><field name="subject">Aluminum alloys</field><field name="subject">Fracture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stretch signal and muscle state dependence of the tonic stretch reflex</field><field name="creator">Cathers, Ian, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">When active skeletal muscle is stretched, it generally responds with a contraction which resists the stretch. This response is termed the muscle stretch reflex. The size (gain) and timing (phase) of the response has been found to depend on many factors including the characteristics of the applied stretch, the muscle contraction level and the subject's intention. Investigations of this stretch reflex have often involved stretches to muscle which contained frequencies either beyond the range of voluntary movement or else which could be consciously tracked. This study sought to characterise the frequency response of the stretch reflex, in terms of its gain and phase, under a variety of conditions while using stretches to the muscle which were relevant to voluntary movement, yet which were too irregular to be tracked. The types of stretch which satisfied these criteria had first to be determined by an investigation of tracking performance under different conditions of peripheral feedback. Having established the types of stretch which could be used to guarantee reflex rather than voluntary responses, the stretch reflex was investigated using stretches of different amplitude and bandwidth and spanning the full range of contraction level. Research was also undertaken to determine whether the gain and phase of the reflex response could be decoupled from the background contraction level of the muscle and to examine any associated effects on the mechanical properties of the limb. Explanatory models for some of these reflex responses were developed. An interaction between normal physiological tremor and the stretch reflex response was also investigated.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stretch reflex</field><field name="subject">Muscle contraction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">History as Discourse: Construals of Time, Cause and Appraisal</field><field name="creator">Coffin, Caroline, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with making explicit the role that language plays in apprenticing social subjects into different social or 'discourse' communities. It focuses specifically on the textual and rhetorical strategies of school history texts written by students, aiming to bring a close linguistic analysis of the texts into relationship with the wider social and cultural context. In particular it focuses on three semantic domains. These are Cause, Time and an area of interpersonal evaluation known as Appraisal.  The main questions addressed are ???How do the semantic motifs of Cause, Time and Appraisal function within the discourse of school history? How are they grammatically and lexically realised? What are the semantic and grammatical shifts and interactions that occur as a result of students moving through the different levels of their apprenticeship? In order to answer these questions the analytical tools of systemic-functional grammar are applied to a corpus of texts produced within the context of Australian secondary schooling. These texts represent the range of written genres that history students need to produce in order to fulfil the objectives and outcomes of the history curriculum. A major feature of the research is the use of Appraisal theory, a framework recently developed in systemic-functional linguistics, for analysing the linguistic resources used to negotiate emotions, judgements and social valuations. This theory proves valuable in taking us beyond more traditional linguistic concerns with interpersonal meaning, which focus on modality and mood structure. The main findings of the linguistic analysis show that construals of Cause, Time and Appraisal are core linguistic tools both for interpreting the past and for persuading audiences of the validity of such interpretations. Analysis also reveals that induction into the (discourse) community of historians can be generally characterised as a process of the student expanding their repertoire of metaphorical and specialised language resources as they move from recording the past to arguing about the past.  By providing a fine grained linguistic analysis of the different types of texts that make up school history writing, the research is able to provide insights into the apprenticeship process and into the function and role of history both within and beyond the school context. The major conclusion reached here is that history inducts students into an abstract world of grammatical metaphor and in so doing provides them with the linguistic means to talk about people and time as abstract entities. It also provides them with the positioning and persuading strategies (the ???intellectual flexibility???) necessary for social positions of responsibility.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Historiography</field><field name="subject">Discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Secondary level</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assimilating complex information</field><field name="creator">Pollock, Edwina Jane, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Methods of instruction which are intended to facilitate understanding tend to incorporate all of the elements required for understanding in the instructions. Frequently, these types of instructions may overwhelm a learner???s limited working memory and hinder learning. The five experiments reported in this thesis were generated by cognitive load theory. Cognitive load theory is based on the assumption that features of human cognitive architecture have important implications for how we learn and understand. The experiments examined an alternative approach to instructional design which had the goal of promoting schema construction in order to foster understanding. A two phase, isolated-interacting elements learning approach was developed which, in the first phase, artificially reduced the element interactivity of complex material by presenting the material as isolated elements of information that could be processed serially, rather than simultaneously, in working memory. In the second phase of instruction, all the information for understanding was presented. The control group???s instruction was a more conventional approach to promoting understanding where all the information for understanding was presented in both Phase 1 and 2. Although a possible consequence of artificially reducing the element interactivity of material may be an initial decrease in a student???s capacity for understanding, it was hypothesised that over the longer term it would lead to an increase in learners??? understanding. The results reported in this thesis provide powerful evidence that for certain groups of learners, information is better learnt through the isolated-interacting elements instructional method. Evidence is also provided in support of the proposal that schema construction is the mechanism underlying the success of the isolated-interacting elements instructional method. Experiments 1 and 3 demonstrated that when novice students are required to learn complex information, the isolated-interacting elements method of instruction was superior to the control method. In contrast, no evidence was found in Experiments 2 and 4 to suggest a difference between these instructional techniques. These contrasting results can be explained by the different levels of domain knowledge possessed by the participants of each experiment. The results of Experiment 5 were similar to those of Experiments 1 and 3, namely that students performed superiorly if they had studied the isolated elements followed by interacting elements instruction. These results provide significant theoretical support for the claim that expertise is the key factor implicated in the beneficial effects associated with the isolated-interacting elements instructional technique since the participants in Experiment 5 had previously participated in Experiments 2 and 4. The difference in the outcomes of these experiments can be explained by the level of domain specific knowledge the participants of Experiment 5 had in each of the knowledge domains tested by the various experiments.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human information processing</field><field name="subject">Cognition Testing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17813</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wintertime Circulation within the Southeast Indian Ocean: a Numerical Study</field><field name="creator">Cirano, Mauro, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">A numerical study is made of the wintertime circulation within the Southeast Indian Ocean (SEIO).

The study here is divided in two parts: (1) available data and the wintertime averaged results from the Ocean Circulation and Climate Advanced Model (OCCAM) are analysed to provide a first order description of the large-scale circulation; (2) a high resolution model (Princeton Ocean Model) is nested within OCCAM to examine the shelf-slope circulation within the eastern SEIO. The nested model is forced with climatological monthly average winds and several experiments were run to simulate the effects of surface fluxes of density, enhanced bottom friction and stronger winds. In summary, the shelf-slope circulation is governed by a surface south-eastward CC that carries around 2 Sv and reaches velocities of up to 50 cm/s, where the shelf is narrowest. The core of the current is generally constrained to the shelf-break region. Zonal winds and geostrophic control of the CC lead to a transport of 1 Sv through Bass Strait and a north-eastward jet that is directed into the strait between King Is. and Tasmania. Further south, the CC is poleward and known as the Zeehan Current (ZC). Between Cape Leeuwin and Tasmania and over the slope region, a westward current (the Flinders Current) is found at depths of 500-1000 m and has an associated transport of 5-7 Sv. The current is shown to result from a northward Sverdrup transport in the deep ocean. Meso-scale eddies are shown to result from baroclinic instability and have wavelengths of around 250 km and transports of 3-4 Sv, and can dominate the slope circulation. A comparison of the numerical results is also made with two current meter data sets and results show an interannual variability in the ZC strength, that is probably related to ENSO.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">numerical modelling</field><field name="subject">Zeehan Current</field><field name="subject">downwelling</field><field name="subject">ocean circulation</field><field name="subject">Indian Ocean</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17820</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Average co-ordinate entropy and a non-singular version of restricted orbit equivalence</field><field name="creator">Mortiss, Genevieve Catherine, Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">A notion of entropy is defined for the non-singular action of finite co-ordinate changes on X - the infinite product of two- point spaces.

Yet, the effects of those representations on behaviour are not understood.  The nine studies conducted for this thesis investigated stereotypic beliefs about youth.  This thesis aimed to specify the range of stereotypic beliefs about youth, the sources of those beliefs, and the consequences of those beliefs for adults' and young people's behaviour. Chapter 1 reviews the stereotype literature and provides information about our current understanding of stereotypic beliefs about youth.  It also highlights the limitations of existing research and presents the rationale for this program of research.	Chapter 2 presents studies 1 to 4, which explored the breadth in the content of four sets of stereotypic beliefs about youth.  Study 1 investigated adults' knowledge of the cultural stereotype of youth and Study 2A specified adults' personal beliefs about youth.  Adults' knowledge of the cultural stereotype was shown to consist of very negative content, although their personal beliefs were both positive and negative in content.  Study 3A compared young people's perceptions of adults' beliefs about youth with their personal beliefs about youth.  Young people's perceptions of adults' beliefs were found to be extremely negative, and to be comparable with that identified as adults??? knowledge of the cultural stereotype of youth in Study 1. In contrast, young people???s personal beliefs about youth were found to be more positive.  Study 4 investigated the extent to which adults and young people hold multiple stereotypes of youth. Adults and young people formed six conceptually similar subtypes of youth.  They were labelled as ???yuppies???, ???lives for today and forget the consequences???, ???depressed???, ???problem kids???, ???active???, and ???conventional???.  The ???problem kids??? subtype was the most salient; it had the greatest number of descriptors assigned to it and the greatest agreement across groups regarding the constellation of traits and behaviours comprising it.	Studies 2B and 3B, also presented in Chapter 2, were carried out to develop two valid and reliable measures of stereotypic beliefs about youth.  In Study 2B, the 20-item Beliefs about Adolescence Scale was developed to assess adults' personal beliefs about youth.  Study 3B developed the 26-item Adolescents??? Perceptions of Adults??? Beliefs Scale to assess young people???s perceptions of adults??? beliefs about them. Both measures were shown to be internally consistent and to have good test-retest reliability.  The Beliefs about Adolescence Scale also demonstrated good convergent validity.	Chapter 3 presents studies 5 and 6, which examined the media as a possible source of stereotypic beliefs about youth.  Study 5 investigated media representations of youth as they appear in newspaper reports.  Study 6 aimed to establish an empirical association between those representations and stereotypic beliefs about youth.  In Study 5, newspaper reports of young people were found to be largely negative; the 'problem kids' stereotype was afforded the most news space.  In Study 6, newspaper readership was shown to be predictive of stereotypic beliefs about youth.  Further, stereotypic beliefs were found to discriminate between readers of broadsheet and tabloid newspapers.	Chapter 4 presents Studies 7 and 8, which focused on the consequences of stereotypic beliefs about youth for evaluations and behaviour.  Study 7 investigated the extent to which beliefs that young people are problematic affect adults' evaluations of young people.  Subjects who were presented with sentences that described irresponsible and disrespectful behaviours later judged a youth target as more irresponsible and disrespectful than subjects who were presented with sentences that described neutral behaviours.  Study 8 investigated whether beliefs that young people are problematic can result in self-fulfilling prophecies. Subjects were exposed to faces of male teenagers or adults and were then paired with partners who had been exposed to faces of male adults.  Each pair of subjects played a word-guessing game and their interaction was recorded.  Judges who were blind to the experimental hypotheses listened to the recordings and rated each participant for the degree of rudeness that was displayed.  Subjects who had been exposed to the teenage faces were rated as ruder than those who had been exposed to adult faces.  Moreover, those who interacted with subjects who had been exposed to teenage faces were rated as ruder than those who interacted with subjects who had been exposed to adult faces. In that way, stereotypic beliefs about youth were shown to produce self-fulfilling prophecies.	Chapter 5 presents Study 9.  Its focus was on young people's perceptions of adults' beliefs about them. It examined the way those beliefs influence young people's engagement in problem behaviour, in interaction with established correlates of problem behaviour.  This was explored via the testing of a structural model of problem behaviour.  The findings provided partial support for the model, and the model accounted for a substantial proportion of the variance in problem behaviour.  Young people's perceptions of adults' beliefs about them made an important contribution to the explanation of problem behaviour involvement.  Subsidiary analyses determined that young people's perceptions that adults believe them to engage in problem behaviour was the 'active ingredient' of that construct.  	Chapter 6 presents the general discussion of the findings from this program of research.  It also outlines their theoretical and practical implications, and points to specific research that is needed to add to the findings of this thesis.  The findings emphasise the important influences of stereotypic beliefs about youth on adults' and young people's behaviour.  Recommendations are made for improving adult-youth relations and preventing adolescent problem behaviour.  In particular, the media and adult members of the community need to recognise the role that they play in the causation of adolescent problem behaviour.  The media have a responsibility to disseminate accurate and balanced information about young people and youth-related issues.  In addition, interventions aimed at reducing adolescent problem behaviour need to incorporate a community-based component that seeks to promote positive adult-youth relations within the wider community.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Youth Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Adolescent psychology</field><field name="subject">Stereotype</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17826</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Empirical Study of Strategic Issue Processing in Public Sector Organisations</field><field name="creator">Perrott, Bruce Edwin, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In recent years public sector organisations in New South Wales have been subjected to changes in their operating environments. Changes have included micro-economic reforms by Government and changes in stakeholders' expectations of how public sector organisations manage their affairs. The need to deal with the increasing number and diversity of issues arising, has motivated public sector managers to become increasingly involved in strategic management. The focus of this research was to study how strategic issues were processed within the context of their approach to strategic management. Strategic issue management has been proposed as an appropriate management system for use in conditions of moderate to high levels of environmental turbulence as a means to providing a mechanism for real time response to emerging issues. Three of the four organisations in the study indicated a progressive increase in perceptions of environmental turbulence over a six year period to points mid way between the 'Changing' and 'Discontinuous' levels on the Ansoff and McDonnell (1990) environmental turbulence scale. Research findings indicted that all four public sector organisations undertake a form of strategic issue management which is separate to the periodic strategic planning cycle. In answer to the criticism of the theoretical void which is seen to exist in linking organisational response to changes in the environment, theoretical models were developed for the Sensing, Deciding and Executing functions of the processing dimension of Ansoff's (1987) proposed paradigm of emerging strategic behaviour. The models provide the framework for tracking how eight strategic issues were processed in four public sector organisations. Field research-was conducted over a fifteen month period collecting both secondary and primary data. A case study research methodology was developed for the project following a review of the relevant literature. There were clear indications that the Sensing, Deciding and Executing functions were performed and that the issues under study passed through numerous phases during their processing cycles. The interconnected and iterative nature of issue processing across the Sensing, Deciding and Executing phases were demonstrated in the research findings.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public institutions</field><field name="subject">Administration agencies</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Public sector</field><field name="subject">Strategic issue management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family Size and Relative Need</field><field name="creator">Bradbury, Bruce William, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines three questions concerned with the relative income needs of families of different sizes - often summarised by indices known as ???equivalence scales???. The first is the extent to which researchers and policy makers should offset the costs of family composition (eg the expenditure costs of children) with the benefits associated with demographic choice (eg the ???joys of parenthood???). Chapter 2 concludes that there are demographic and financial market constraints that will often make a narrow focus on expenditure costs appropriate for distributional research and tax/transfer policies. However, this will not always be the case. One implication of this result is that it may be reasonable for distributional research to use different equivalence scales for adults and children in the same household. Part 2 of the thesis introduces a new method for the estimation of the within-household income distribution and expenditure costs of different family types. This is based upon the household welfare model of Samuelson together with Lau???s method for modelling the joint consumption of household goods. In Chapter 4, this method is applied to the estimation of equivalence scales for older singles and married couples. The estimation is based upon a detailed set of assumptions about the extent of joint consumption for 17 different commodity groups. The main conclusions are that: the theoretical model fits the observed behaviour well (with the exception of some home production effects); that aged couples share their income relatively evenly; and that the relative rate of pension for aged singles in Australia is probably too low. In Part 3, the thesis examines how changes in poverty can be estimated when there is uncertainty about the equivalence scale. The thesis proposes a new method which permits a set of upper and lower bounds for the equivalence scale to be assumed, which in turn determine upper and lower bounds for the increase in poverty. This method is applied to measure the change in poverty in Australia during the 1980s. Equivalence scales can be found that imply either an increase or a decrease in poverty.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumer equivalence scales</field><field name="subject">poverty</field><field name="subject">living standards</field><field name="subject">household welfare</field><field name="subject">intra-household allocation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17174</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Shear on Flocculation and Floc Size/Structure</field><field name="creator">Selomulya, Cordelia, Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The effect of shear on the evolution of floc properties was investigated to analyse the flocculation mechanisms. Little fundamental attention has been given to the shear influence that often creates compact aggregates, while the floc characteristics might differ in other aggregating conditions. It is thus crucial to understand how flocs evolve to steady state, if their properties are to be 'tailored' to suit subsequent solids-liquid separation processes. In this work, flocculation of monodisperse latex particles of various sizes (60, 380, and 810 nm diameter) via electrolyte addition was carried out in a couette-flow and also in shear fields generated by an axial-flow impeller (Fluid foil A310) and a radial-flow impeller (Rushton R100) in standard mixing tanks. A small-angle light scattering technique was used to acquire information regarding the time variation of floc properties in a non-intrusive manner. The structure was quantified by a measure of fractal dimension, signifying the degree of floc compactness. Estimates of the average floc mass were also obtained from the aggregate scattering patterns.  By monitoring the changes in floc structure and mass, corresponding to the size evolution; mechanisms of floc formation, fragmentation, and restructuring were identified. Aggregates of 60 and 380 nm particles were observed to grew larger initially, before decreasing to their equilibrium sizes at moderate shear rates (32 - 100 s-1) in a homogeneous shear environment. Floc restructuring at large length scales occurred extensively, and was responsible for the drop in size, particularly at the early stage of the process. Aggregates of 810 nm particles did not, however, display this behaviour. Flocs of larger primary particles were presumably susceptible to breakage rather than deformation, as they were weaker under comparable conditions. Denser aggregates were found when restructuring transpired, while comparatively tenuous flocs were observed when formation and breakage kinetics were the governing mechanisms. The disparity in floc behaviour at higher shear rates (246 s-1 - 330 s-1) was less apparent. The intense hydrodynamic stresses in those instances inevitably caused fragmentation, regardless of the intrinsic particle properties; hence the observed floc compaction was the product of break-up and re-aggregation. A population balance model, incorporating variation in floc structure, displayed comparable trends in size evolution; verifying that restructuring indeed took an important role under certain flocculation conditions. Similar phenomena were likewise observed with the flocculation in stirred tanks. The results reinforced findings in literature; that while circulation time controlled the process kinetics; the floc size was determined by the turbulent stresses. In addition, the maximum shear levels also influenced the floc structures, with denser aggregates produced in a shear field generated using the radial-flow impeller at equivalent energy dissipation per-unit mass.  A correlation between non-dimensional floc factor that embodied the aggregate size and structure, and aggregation factor comprising the significant parameters from flocculation conditions, was proposed. The proposed relationship takes into account aspects such as the aggregate structure, interparticle forces, and particle concentration that are often overlooked in existing relationships, which usually only relate the maximum floc size to the applied energy dissipation rate. It thus provides an improved manner of presenting general flocculation data, as well as a means to predict floc properties produced under a specific aggregation condition. Future studies with increasingly complex systems that resemble real conditions are recommended in order to establish a practical understanding of the flocculation mechanisms, for the purpose of optimising the aggregate properties.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flocculation</field><field name="subject">floc properties</field><field name="subject">restructuring</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">small-angle light scattering</field><field name="subject">shear flow</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic portfolio optimization &amp; asset pricing : Martingale methods and probability distortion functions</field><field name="creator">Hamada, Mahmoud, Actuarial Studies, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation consist of three contributions to financial and insurance mathematics.  The first part considers numerical methods for dynamic portfolio optimisation in the expected utility model. The aim is to compare the risk-neutral computational approach (RNCA) also known as the martingale approach to stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) in a discrete-time setting. The main idea of the RNCA is to use the completeness and the arbitrage free properties of the market to compute the optimal consumption rules and then determine the trading strategy that finance this optimal consumption. In contrast, SDP solves for the optimal consumption and investment rules simultaneously using backward recursion and the principle of optimality. The setting that we consider is a discrete time and state space lattice. We provide some new theoretical results relating to the Hyperbolic Absolute Risk Aversion class of utility functions as well as propose a straightforward implementation of RNCA in binomial and trinomial lattices. Moreover, instead of discretizing the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with possibly more than one state variable, we use symbolic algorithms to implement stochastic dynamic programming. This new approach provides a simpler numerical procedure for computing optimal consumption-investment policies. A comparison of the RNCA with SDP demonstrates the superiority of the RNCA in terms of computation. 	The second part considers the pricing of contingent claims using an approach developed and applied in applied in insurance. This approach utilize probability distortion functions as the dual of the utility functions used in financial theory. The main idea of the dual theory is to distort the subjective probabilities rather than outcomes to express the investor????????s risk aversion. In the first part, the RNCA for asset allocation uses the same principle as risk-neutral valuation for derivative pricing. The idea of the second part of this research is to show that the risk-neutral valuation can be recovered from the probability distortion function approach, thereby establishing consistency between the insurance and the financial approaches. We prove that pricing contingent claims under the real world probability measure using an appropriate distortion operator produces arbitrage-free prices when the underlying asset prices are log-normal. We investigate cases when the insurance-based approach fails to produce arbitrage-free prices and determine the appropriate distortion operator under more general assumptions than those used in Black-Scholes option pricing. 	In the third part we introduce dynamic portfolio optimisation with risk measures based on probability distortion function and provide a formal treatment of this class of risk measures. We employ the RNCA to study the consumption-investment problem in discrete time with preferences consistent with Yaari????????s dual (non-expected utility) theory of choice. As an application, we first consider risk measures based on the Proportional Hazard Transform that treats the upside and downside of the risk differently and secondly a risk measure based on the standard Normal cumulative distribution function. When the objective is to maximise a dual utility of wealth, and the underlying security returns are normal, the efficient frontier is found to be the same as in the mean-variance portfolio problem for an equivalent risk tolerance. When the objective is to maximise a dual utility of consumption, then ????????plunging???????????? behaviour occurs ( investing everything is the risky asset). Other properties of the optimal consumption-investment policies in the dual theory are also investigated and discussed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Portfolio management</field><field name="subject">Capital assets pricing model</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comorbidity between substance use and mental health in Australia:  Relationships of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use with other substance use and mental disorders</field><field name="creator">Degenhardt, Louisa, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Research into the comorbidity (or co-occurrence) of mental disorders is a relatively recent phenomenon. Much of this research has been conducted in clinical samples, which are prone to a range of biases that mean that the patterns observed are not representative of the general population. Although population-level research has previously been carried out, this thesis provides the first examination of comorbidity in the Australian population.  This thesis examined the comorbidity of substance use and mental disorders among Australian adults. The major empirical work involved an examination of the patterns of homotypic comorbidity (other substance use disorders) and heterotypic comorbidity (mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and psychosis) of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis in the 1997 Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being (NSMHWB). These drugs were chosen as they are the most commonly used psychoactive substances in the Australian population. The NSMHWB involved a structured diagnostic interview of mental disorders with a representative sample of Australian adults.  Three questions were addressed using this data: (1) What patterns of comorbidity exist between tobacco, alcohol and cannabis use, and other substance use and mental disorders?; (2) Are these patterns of comorbidity explained by common factors?; and (3) Does comorbidity affect the likelihood that mental health treatment has been sought?  Similar patterns of homotypic comorbidity were observed for all three substances, and they were not explained by the other factors examined (gender, age, education, relationship status, employment and neuroticism). Cannabis dependence was the most strongly associated with other substance use disorders. Heterotypic comorbidity differed between alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use. Tobacco use predicted increased rates of all three groups of mental disorders (mood, anxiety and psychotic disorders). In the case of alcohol, only alcohol dependence was related to increased rates of all groups of mental disorders; alcohol use and abuse were not associated with heterotypic comorbidity. Any level of cannabis involvement was related to a similarly increased risk of mood and anxiety disorders. Cannabis use was linearly related to the risk of screening positively for psychosis. Common factors did not change the patterns of heterotypic comorbidity of tobacco and alcohol use. However, alcohol, tobacco and other drug use appeared to explain the higher rates of mood and anxiety disorders among cannabis users. Treatment seeking was much more likely among alcohol, tobacco and cannabis users when they had comorbid mental disorders. It was moderately increased when they had comorbid substance use disorders.  The second piece of empirical work provided a more detailed examination of comorbid substance use problems among persons with psychosis. This topic was selected due to the limited epidemiological research on this issue, and the relatively large burden of disability that psychosis places upon the individual and the community. NSMHWB data were used to examine the prevalence of comorbid substance use disorders among persons who were likely to have met criteria for psychosis (as assessed by a screener used in the NSMHWB). Multiple regression analyses were used to test possible explanations for the higher rates of substance use disorders observed among persons reporting higher numbers of psychotic symptoms. The odds of alcohol dependence and regular tobacco use increased 1.5 times, and the odds of cannabis dependence increased twice, with each additional psychotic symptom reported, after adjusting for other substance use disorders, other mental disorders and demographic characteristics. Given the debate about the reasons for the association between cannabis use and psychosis, the final study used mathematical modelling to test four hypotheses about relationships between cannabis use and psychosis. Specifically, it examined trends in psychosis that would be predicted given the marked increases in the prevalence of cannabis use that have occurred in Australia over the past thirty years. The results suggested that a causal relationship - in which cannabis use caused psychosis among persons who would not otherwise have developed the disorder - is unlikely to explain the association. There was a better fit to the data provided by the other hypotheses examined, namely, that (a) cannabis use precipitates psychosis among vulnerable individuals; (b) cannabis use increases the risk of relapse among persons with psychosis; and (c) persons with psychosis are more likely to become regular cannabis users (without any effect upon the disorder). This thesis has demonstrated that in Australian adults there is significant comorbidity between alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use and other substance use and mental disorders. These patterns differ across the three substances. Some types of heterotypic comorbidity  (e.g. between cannabis use and mood/anxiety disorders) are explained by common factors. The limited range of common factors tested here did not explain homotypic comorbidity. This thesis also suggested that mathematical modelling is a useful approach to consider when examining the plausibility of different relationships between risk factors and mental disorders. A number of hypotheses regarding comorbidity could not be tested using NSMHWB data, such as common genetic and other environmental factors. These can best be tested in research with samples of twins, and using longitudinal designs that assess a wide range of social and environmental factors. The findings of this thesis also have implications for treatment, because persons with comorbid disorders are more likely to seek treatment. There is an absence of validated treatments for persons with comorbid substance use and mental disorders, and more research is needed on this issue.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Substance abuse Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Mental illness Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into the biological function of the highly conserved GTPase LepA</field><field name="creator">Sinan, Canan P., School of Microbiology &amp; Immunology, UNSW</field><field name="description">LepA is a highly conserved GTP-binding protein of unknown function. Its amino acid sequence reveals that it is a GTPase with homology to elongation factor G (EF-G). Previous data led to the hypothesis that LepA negatively regulates a posttranslational process such as protein folding. To examine this possibility, two sets of strains carrying mutated alleles encoding molecular chaperones in E. coli were transformed with a lepA expression vector. LepA had a dominant negative effect specifically in a dnaK25 strain whose product exhibits a 20-fold lower ATPase activity compared to wild-type DnaK. The expression of DnaK and other heat-shock proteins is repressed following temperature downshift. Aptly, it was found that temperature shift from 37 degrees Celcius to 15 degrees Celcius in cells harboring a lepA expression vector led to the induction of lepA and downstream lepB. Furthermore, like cold-shock genes, lepA and lepB are induced by sublethal doses of chloramphenicol, although it appears that lep operon induction is related to the antibiotic's action on the 50S ribosome. Due to LepA's insolubility, it could not be confirmed whether it interacts with DnaK, DnaJ or which other proteins it interacts with. Two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis revealed the absence of an isoform of OmpA in two lepA deletion strains. It is possible that LepA is involved in a folding pathway that is responsible for the conformation of this isoform. Phylogenetic analysis showed that while LepA is extremely well conserved and has been identified in all completed Bacterial and Eukaryal genomes, it is not present in the completed genomes of any Archaea. Sequence analysis revealed the existence of N-terminus mitochondrial import sequences in Eukaryal LepA orthologues. Additionally, A. thaliana contains a second LepA orthologue that clusters phylogenetically with Synechocystis LepA and has a chloroplastic import sequence. This indicates that plastidal LepA was acquired in A. thaliana (and probably in all plants) through endosymbiosis of an ancestral cyanobacterium. In constrast, mitochondrial LepA are not closely related to those of a- proteobacteria, believed to be the precursors of mitochondria. These findings imply that in sharp contrast to mitochondrial LepA, chloroplastic LepA is under strong evolutionary pressure to remain conserved.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Guanosine triphosphatase</field><field name="subject">G proteins</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When imagining instructions is effective</field><field name="creator">Ginns, Paul William, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Learning from worked examples typically involves study activities, involving reading such materials carefully and attempting to understand the information presented. Considerable evidence has amassed regarding the benefits for novices of studying appropriately constructed worked examples paired with practice questions. However, prior research from the cognitive and sports psychology literatures suggests mental practice of worked examples may be an effective adjunct to studying such materials. Meta-analyses of these literatures suggest the utility of mental practice depends upon the degree of cognitive elements contained within a task, and also suggest that some prior knowledge of a task is necessary for mental practice to be effective.  The present series of studies aimed to identify conditions under which mental practice is effective in educationally realistic, highly cognitive domains. Based on the above meta-analytic results, mental practice was hypothesised to enhance learning over further study in highly cognitive domains, but only when students either had sufficient prior knowledge, or were able to develop such knowledge over the course of an instructional intervention. Study activities were primarily expected to support knowledge acquisition, while imagining-based activities (mental practice) were expected to support knowledge automation. The experiments herein thus investigated interactions between levels of prior knowledge, complexity of instructional material, and levels of learning from imagination versus conventional study strategies. In Experiment 1, under conditions of low prior knowledge and complex material (HTML), students who studied worked examples outperformed those who imagined. Experiment 2, using simplified but still complex materials and a similar participant pool, found no differences between conditions, but Experiment 3, using stricter experimental design, found a study effect. In Experiment 4, an imagination effect was found under high prior knowledge. Experiment 5, using less experienced learners, suggested those who studied outperformed those whom imagined on acquisition questions. Experiment 6 found a sequence of study then imagination is more effective than imagination then study. The results have broad application for effective sequencing of these instructional strategies, but development of an accurate metric for imagination "readiness" is required to advance theory and practice, and more evidence is needed for a schema automation explanation of mental practice effects.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental practice</field><field name="subject">Worked examples</field><field name="subject">Instructional design</field><field name="subject">Instructional systems</field><field name="subject">Cognition Testing</field><field name="subject">Visualization</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18634</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Walking stability in young, old and neuropathic subjects</field><field name="creator">Menz, Hylton, Physiology, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates walking patterns in healthy young people and in people with an increased risk of falling, and determines the physiological contributions to walking stability. First, a review of the relevant literature on techniques for assessing walking stability, age-related changes in balance and gait, and the contributions of vision, vestibular function, peripheral sensation and strength was undertaken. In response to a critical analysis of these findings, a new technique and protocol for the assessment of walking stability was developed. This involved measuring and analysing head and pelvis accelerations while subjects walked on a level surface and an irregular surface. Gait patterns were studied in 30 young healthy subjects and two groups known to be at increased risk of falling - 100 subjects over the age of 75, and 30 subjects with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. A series of vision, sensation, strength, reaction time and balance tests were also undertaken to identify subjects??? physiological abilities and risk of falls. Acceleration patterns of the head and pelvis differed according to physiological risk of falling, particularly when walking on the irregular surface. Those with a high risk of falling walked with a reduced velocity, cadence and step length, and exhibited less rhythmic acceleration patterns at the head and pelvis. Gait patterns were significantly associated with leg strength, peripheral sensation and reaction time. It is concluded that subjects with a high physiological risk of falling exhibit characteristic patterns of walking that indicate an impaired ability to control the movement of the pelvis and head, which may predispose to loss of balance.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">accidental falls</field><field name="subject">balance</field><field name="subject">ageing</field><field name="subject">gait</field><field name="subject">gait in humans</field><field name="subject">human locomotion</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic generation of daily rainfall for catchment water management studies</field><field name="creator">Harrold, Timothy Ives, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an approach for generating long synthetic sequences of single-site daily rainfall which can incorporate low-frequency features such as drought, while still accurately representing the day-to-day variations in rainfall. The approach is implemented in a two-stage process. The first stage is to generate the entire sequence of rainfall occurrence (i.e. whether each day is dry or wet). The second stage is to generate the rainfall amount on all wet days in the sequence. The models used in both stages are nonparametric (they make minimal general assumptions rather than specific assumptions about the distributional and dependence characteristics of the variables involved), and ensure an appropriate representation of the seasonal variations in rainfall. A key aspect in formulation of the models is selection of the predictor variables used to represent the historical features of the rainfall record. Methods for selection of the predictors are presented here. The approach is applied to daily rainfall from Sydney and Melbourne. The models that are developed use daily-level, seasonal-level, annual-level, and multi-year predictors for rainfall occurrence, and daily-level and annual-level predictors for rainfall amount. The resulting generated sequences provide a better representation of the variability associated with droughts and sustained wet periods than was previously possible. These sequences will be useful in catchment water management studies as a tool for exploring the potential response of catchments to possible future rainfall.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Watershed management</field><field name="subject">Stochastic analysis</field><field name="subject">Rain and rainfall</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18640</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing Australian Spatial Data Policies - Existing Practices and Future Strategies</field><field name="creator">Mason, Renate, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the problems associated with the development of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs). The results of this investigation are used as input for the development of new spatial data policy strategies for individual organisations to enable an improved better facilitation of SDIs. Policy issues that need to be considered by an organisation when developing spatial data policies, were identified as being: SDI requirements; organisational issues; technical issues; Governmental/organisational duties; ownership/custodianship; privacy and confidentiality; legal liability, contracts and licences; Intellectual Property Law; economic analysis; data management; outreach, cooperation and political mandate; and users' choices, rights and obligations.  In order to gain an understanding of current spatial data policy practices and to device new policy strategies a spatial data survey was conducted. This survey addressed the identified SDI problem areas. Some 6630 questionnaires were mailed out with more than 400 responses returned. These were reduced to 379 useful responses. Once analysed, the results were compared with the findings of the SDI investigation and used throughout the thesis. The results of the analysis to the spatial data survey are displayed in tables and graphs throughout Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6 and in Appendix 2. The tables and graphs show the answers to the questions asked in the questionnaire as a percentage of the total number of respondents. The survey discovered that many organisations had no spatial data policies, nor individual policies on spatial data pricing and/or intellectual property protection.  This thesis established that SDI requirements are not being met by many spatial data policies used by individual organisations. Hence, the thesis studied the spatial data policy issues that are involved when an organisation develops new policies with the aim to aid the development of SDIs. It uniquely established current Australian spatial data policy practices in the areas of spatial data quality, access, pricing, and legal issues to form the basis for future strategies. It reviewed the current knowledge of intellectual property law applied to spatial data and devised new approaches to deal with all the identified policy issues. Finally, the thesis defines spatial data policies that facilitate SDI development.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="subject">Spatial Data</field><field name="subject">Policies</field><field name="subject">SDI</field><field name="subject">Intellectual Property</field><field name="subject">Copyright</field><field name="subject">Legal Liabilities</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Numerical and Experimental Investigation of High-Speed Liquid Jets - Their Characteristics and Dynamics.</field><field name="creator">Zakrzewski, Sam, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A comprehensive understanding of high-speed liquid jets is required for their introduction into engine and combustion applications. Their transient nature, short lifetime, unique characteristics and the inability to take many experimental readings, has inhibited this need. This study investigates the outflow of a high-speed liquid jet into quiescent atmospheric air. The key characteristics present are, a bow shock wave preceding the jet head, an enhanced mixing layer and the transient deformation of the liquid jet core. The outflow regime is studied in an experimental and numerical manner.  In the experimental investigation, a high-speed liquid water jet is generated using the momentum exchange by impact method. The jet velocity is supersonic with respect to the impinged gaseous medium. The resulting jet speed is Mach 1.8. The jet is visualised with the use of shadowgraph apparatus. Visualisation takes place over a variety of time steps in the liquid jet???s life span and illustrates the four major development stages. The stages progress from initial rapid core jet expansion to jet stabilisation and characteristic uniform gradient formation. The visualisation shows that at all stages of the jet???s life it is axi-symmetric. One dimensional nozzle analysis and a clean bow shock wave indicate that the pulsing jet phenomenon can be ignored.  In the numerical investigation, a time marching finite volume scheme is employed. The bow shock wave characteristics are studied with the use of a blunt body analogy. The jet at a specific time frame is considered a solid body. The jet shape is found to have an important influence on the shock position and shape. Analysis of the results indicates a shock stand-off similar to that seen in experimental observations and the prediction of shock data.  The jet life span is modelled using a species dependent density model. The transient calculations reproduce the key jet shape characteristics shown in experimental visualisation. The mushrooming effect and large mixing layer are shown to develop. These effects are strongest when the shock wave transience has yet to stabilise. Quantitative analysis of the mixing layer at varying time steps is presented.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high-speed liquid jet</field><field name="subject">bow shock wave</field><field name="subject">shadowgraph</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamics (CFD).</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Air-sea flux parameterisations in a shallow tropical sea</field><field name="creator">Schulz, Eric Werner, mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the air-sea fluxes of momentum, sensible heat and latent heat. Fluxes are estimated using the covariance, COARE2.6b bulk flux algorithm, and inertial dissipation methods. The bulk algorithm is validated against the covariance fluxes for the first time in a light-wind, shallow tropical sea, with strong atmospheric instability and low sea state conditions. The removal of ship motion contamination is investigated. This is the first study to quantify the errors associated with corrections for ship motion contamination, and the effects of motion contamination on the covariance calculated heat fluxes. Flow distortion is investigated. Bulk transfer coefficients and roughness lengths are computed and related to the sea state.     Ship motion contamination is successfully removed in 86% of the runs. Error analysis of the motion removal algorithm indicates maximum uncertainties of 15% in the wind fluctuations, and 0.002 N/m/m for the wind stress. Motion correction changes the stress by more than 15% in half of the runs analysed. The ship is found to accelerate the mean air flow and deflect it above the horizontal. A correction is developed for the air flow acceleration.  The scalar fluxes show good agreement on average for all the methods. As wind speed approaches zero, covariance wind stress is significantly larger than the bulk and inertial dissipation derived wind stress.  The non-zero covariance wind stress is reflected in the drag coefficient, CdN10, and momentum roughness length, z0, which are much larger than the parameterisations used in the bulk algorithm. The MCTEX CdN10, wind speed (u10N) relation is  1000 x Cd10N = 1.03 + 7.88/(u10N)^2  0.8 &amp;lt u10N &amp;lt 7.5 m/s  z0 is primarily a function of wind speed rather than sea state, with largest roughness lengths occurring as wind speed approaches zero. This relation is used in the bulk algorithm, yielding good agreement between covariance and bulk derived wind stress. A new parameterisation for the effects of gustiness, based on wind variance is developed. This brings the bulk wind stress into agreement with the covariance derived wind stress.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">air sea interaction</field><field name="subject">flux</field><field name="subject">motion correction</field><field name="subject">marine meteorology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework in support of structural monitoring by real time kinematic GPS and multisensor data</field><field name="creator">Ogaja, Clement, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Due to structural damages from earthquakes and strong winds, engineers and scientists have focused on performance based design methods and sensors directly measuring relative displacements. Among the monitoring methods being considered include those using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. However, as the technical feasibility of using GPS for recording relative displacements has been (and is still being) proven, the challenge for users is to determine how to make use of the relative displacements being recorded. This thesis proposes a mathematical framework that supports the use of RTK-GPS and multisensor data for structural monitoring. Its main contributions are as follows:  (a)	Most of the emerging GPS-based structural monitoring systems consist of GPS receiver arrays (dozens or hundreds deployed on a structure), and the issue of integrity of the GPS data generated must be addressed for such systems. Based on this recognition, a methodology for integrity monitoring using a data redundancy approach has been proposed and tested for a multi-antenna measurement environment. The benefit of this approach is that it verifies the reliability of both the measuring instruments and the processed data contrary to the existing methods that only verifies the reliability of the processed data.  (b)	For real-time structural monitoring applications, high frequency data ought to be generated. A methodology that can extract, in real-time, deformation parameters from high frequency RTK measurements is proposed. The methodology is tested and shown to be effective for determining the amplitude and frequency of structural dynamics. Thus, it is suitable for the dynamic monitoring of towers, tall buildings and long span suspension bridges.  (c)	In the overall effort of deformation analysis, large quantities of observations are required, both of causative phenomena (e.g., wind velocity, temperature, pressure), and of response effects (e.g., accelerations, coordinate displacements, tilt, strain, etc.). One of the problems to be circumvented is that of dealing with excess data generated both due to process automation and the large number of instruments employed. This research proposes a methodology based on multivariate statistical process control whose benefit is that excess data generated on-line is reduced, while maintaining a timely response analysis of the GPS data (since they can give direct coordinate results).  Based on the above contributions, a demonstrator software system was designed and implemented for the Windows operating system. Tests of the system with datasets from UNSW experiments, the Calgary Tower monitoring experiment in Canada, the Xiamen Bank Building monitoring experiment in China, and the Republic Plaza Building monitoring experiment in Singapore, have shown good results.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multisensor</field><field name="subject">data</field><field name="subject">kinematic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diversions in a tented field : theatricality and the images and perceptions of warfare in Sydney entertainments 1879-1902</field><field name="creator">McPherson, Ailsa, School of Theatre, Film &amp; Dance, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the theatricality which accompanied the establishment, development and deployment of the colonial army in New South Wales during the last two decades of the nineteenth century.  It investigates the transfer to the colony of the military ethos of the Imperial power, and explores the ways in which performances of military spectacle, in both theatrical and paratheatrical contexts, were interpreted by the colonists. The primary sources for the research are the Sydney press and the Mitchell `Australiana' collection of the State Library of New South Wales. The framework of the argument is presented in five chapters. The first, Displaying, investigates the relationship between civilians and the military forces at training camps, and then the performances of sham fights. The second, Committing, explores the attitudes of civilians and soldiers at the departures of New South Wales troops to the Soudan and Boer Wars. Informing, thirdly, investigates how the Imperial military ideology was conveyed through performance, and how this information was interpreted in the colony. Accommodating analyses songs and theatre performances which first reflected colonial anticipations at the commitment to conflict and then attempted to accommodate the actuality of the experience. Lastly, Desiring, explores the colonists' endeavours to invent traditions which satisfied the discrepancy between their hopes and their experiences of Imperial war. This thesis asserts that the colonial reinterpretation of military ideology was influenced by concepts both of service to the Imperial power and of national identity. The interplay between these influences led to the colonists' idealising the Imperial association. This ideal was not demonstrated in the practice of association. The result of this experience was a defining of the differences between colonial and Imperial perceptions, rather than a reinforcement of their similarities. Much of the exploration of thesis also prepares the ground for a fuller cultural understanding of the issues at play in the final emergence of the Anzac tradition at the engagement of colonial soldiers against Turkish troops at Gallipoli in April, 1915.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Army</field><field name="subject">Theater</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">19th century</field><field name="subject">Performing arts</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18264</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurement and time series analysis of emotion in music</field><field name="creator">Schubert, Emery, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relations among emotions and musical features and their changes with time, based on the assertion that there exist underlying, culturally specific, quantifiable rules which govern these relations.  I designed, programmed and tested a computer controlled Two-Dimensional Emotion Space (2DES) which administered and controlled all aspects of the experimental work.  The 2DES instrument consisted of two bipolar emotional response (ER) dimensions: valence (happiness-sadness) and arousal (activeness-sleepiness).  The instrument had a test-retest reliability exceeding 0.83 (p &amp;gt 0.01, N = 28) when words and pictures of facial expressions were used as the test stimuli.  Construct validity was quantified (r &amp;lt 0.84,  p &amp;gt 0.01). The 2DES was developed to collect continuous responses to recordings of four movements of music (N = 67) chosen to elicit responses in all quadrants of the 2DES: &amp;quotMorning&amp;quot from Peer Gynt, Adagio from Rodrigo???s Concierto de Aranjuez (Aranjuez), Dvorak???s Slavonic Dance Op 42, No. 1 and Pizzicato Polka by Strauss.  Test-retest reliability was 0.74 (p &amp;gt 0.001, N = 14).  Five salient and objectively quantifiable features of the musical signal (MFs) were scaled and used for time series analysis of the stimuli: melodic pitch, tempo, loudness, frequency spectrum centroid (timbral sharpness) and texture (number of different instruments playing).  A quantitative analysis consisted of: (1) first order differencing to remove trends, (2) determination of suitable, lagged MFs to keep as regressors via stepwise regression, and (3) regression of each ER onto selected MFs with first order autoregressive adjustment for serial correlation. Regression coefficients indicated that first order differenced (???) loudness and ???tempo had the largest correlations with ???arousal across all pieces, and ???melodic pitch correlated with ???valence for Aranjuez (p &amp;gt 0.01 for all coefficients).  The models were able to explain up to 73% of mean response variance.  Additional variation was explained qualitatively as being due to interruptions, interactions and collinearity:  The minor key and dissonances in a tonal context moved valence toward the negative direction; Short duration and perfect cadences moved valence in the positive direction.  The 2DES measure and serial correlation adjusted regression models were, together, shown to be powerful tools for understanding relations among musical features and emotional response.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music</field><field name="subject">Philosophy and aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Musical analysis</field><field name="subject">Emotion</field><field name="subject">Time series analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antisense RNA-mediated gene silencing in fission yeast</field><field name="creator">Raponi, Mitch, Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Genetics, UNSW</field><field name="description">The major aims of this thesis were to investigate the influence of i) antisense gene location relative to the target gene locus (?????location effect?????), ii) double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) formation, and iii) over-expression of host-encoded proteins on antisense RNA-mediated gene regulation. To test the location effect hypothesis, strains were generated which contained the target lacZ gene at a fixed location and the antisense lacZ gene at various genomic locations including all arms of the three fission yeast chomosomes and in close proximity to the target gene locus. A long inverse-PCR protocol was developed to rapidly identify the precise site of antisense gene integration in the fission yeast transformants. No significant difference in lacZ suppression was observed when the antisense gene was integrated in close proximity to the target gene locus, compared with other genomic locations, indicating that target and antisense gene co-localisation is not a critical factor for efficient antisense RNA-mediated gene suppression in vivo. Instead, increased lacZ down-regulation correlated with an increase in the steady-state level of antisense RNA, which was dependent on genomic position effects and transgene copy number. In contrast, convergent transcription of an overlapping antisense lacZ gene was found to be very effective at inhibiting lacZ gene expression. DsRNA was also found to be a central component of antisense RNA-mediated gene silencing in fission yeast. It was shown that gene suppression could be enhanced by increasing the intracellular concentration of non-coding lacZ RNA, while expression of a lacZ panhandle RNA also inhibited beta-galactosidase activity. In addition, over-expression of the ATP-dependent RNA-helicase, ded1, was found to specifically enhance antisense RNA-mediated gene silencing. Through a unique overexpression screen, four novel factors were identified which specifically enhanced antisense RNA-mediated gene silencing by up to an additional 50%. The products of these antisense enhancing sequences (aes factors), all have natural associations with nucleic acids which is consistent with other proteins which have previously been identified to be involved in posttranscriptional gene silencing.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fission yeast</field><field name="subject">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</field><field name="subject">antisense RNA</field><field name="subject">dsRNA</field><field name="subject">gene silencing</field><field name="subject">lacZ</field><field name="subject">antisense enhancing sequence</field><field name="subject">Plant gene silencing</field><field name="subject">Yeast fungi</field><field name="subject">Antisense nucleic acids</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of aquitard windows in the development of alluvial groundwater systems : Lower Murrumbidgee, Australia</field><field name="creator">Timms, Wendy Amanda, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Variable groundwater quality in complex aquifer-aquitard systems presents a challenge for sustainable groundwater development. In the Lower Murrumbidgee alluvial fan of the Murray-Darling Basin in semi arid inland Australia, shallow groundwater is saline (12000 &amp;micro S/cm) and locally contaminated by nitrate. Deep fresh aquifers (150 &amp;micro S/cm), developed as an irrigation water supply, were thought to be protected from downwards leakage by laterally extensive aquitards. However, hydrochemical sampling, augmented by historic data, revealed that aquifer salinisation  (400 to 4000 &amp;micro S/cm) had occurred at some sites to 50 m depth since the mid 1980s. Aquitard windows, landscape depositional features at a scale of 10s to 100s of metres which are rarely detected by conventional investigations, were proposed as conduits for rapid downwards leakage in stressed systems. Intensive research was conducted at the Tubbo site where downhole geophysical logging and minimally disturbed cores were used to describe a saline clayey silt to 15m depth, an indurated clayey sand and 2 deep deposits of hard clayey silt. Fracturing was inferred by the scale dependency of aquitard permeability (Kv 10E-11 to 10E-6 m/s).  Lithological variation near the surface was delineated by electrical imaging which revealed a 40m wide aquitard window beneath a veneer of smectite clay. Intensive monitoring of groundwater pressures in six piezometers (23-96 m depth) near the Tubbo irrigation bore and two other peizometers upgradient, indicated that the indurated clayey sand formed an effective hydraulic barrier but the deep silty deposits were spatially discontinuous. Groundwater samples were collected before, three times during, and after the 1998-99 irrigation season. A large, but delayed TDS increase occurred in the shallow aquifer and small pulses of saline water were sustained in the middle aquifer but shortlived in the deep aquifer. Hydrochemical and isotopic data dC-13, dH-2, dO-18, C-14 and H-3) showed the middle aquifer mixing with the deep aquifer, though retaining the signature of a palaeowater. Hydrochemical changes were accounted for with PHREEQC inverse mass balance models for the shallow aquifer. Mixing of aquifer water with 20-70% saline porewater from the upper aquitard occurred, together with ion exchange and NaCl dissolution. Based on an axisymmetric radial FEFLOW model, 5-30% of the volume pumped was accounted for by vertical leakage from the middle aquifer. Leakage from the shallow aquifer was small but significant, as it allowed high salinity water to migrate. Permeability and compressible storage measurements (Ss 10E-5 to 10E-4 /m) were used to constrain model calibration, and to show that direct mixing occurred mainly via aquitard windows at depth, and between the shallow and middle aquifers via leaky boreholes. Fracture flow and aquifer-aquitard interaction by diffusion were of secondary importance.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogeology</field><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">salinisation</field><field name="subject">nitrate</field><field name="subject">leakage</field><field name="subject">recharge</field><field name="subject">contamination</field><field name="subject">hydrochemistry</field><field name="subject">aquitard</field><field name="subject">clay</field><field name="subject">hydrochemical modeling</field><field name="subject">flow modeling</field><field name="subject">PHREEQC</field><field name="subject">FEFLOW</field><field name="subject">Lower Murrumbidgee</field><field name="subject">Murray-Darling Basin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18671</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gay Asian and Caucasian men in Sydney: cultural, social and cognitive factors associated with sex practices</field><field name="creator">Mao, Limin, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Using the perspectives of individualism-collectivism, Social Cognitive Theory and other concepts such as gay community attachment, this study focused on issues of homosexual identification, disclosure and sexual risk practices in relation to cross-cultural differences among gay Asian and Caucasian men in Sydney.  Mostly recruited from gay social venues, 19 gay Asian men participated in exploratory focus groups discussions, another 201 gay Caucasian and 199 gay Asian men completed an anonymous questionnaire, and a further 10 gay Caucasian and 9 gay Asian men took part in in-depth one-to-one interviews.  The major findings were: gay Asian men tended to experience conflict, in being both gay and Asian, related to individualism and collectivism; the gay Asian and Caucasian men differed in various aspects of homosexual practice, but shared certain sexual traits and practices; self-efficacy in safe sex and gay community attachment were key factors associated with gay men???s sexual risk practices (???risk??? being defined as unprotected anal intercourse with any casual partners or with a regular partner whose HIV status was not concordant with the participant???s).  This study provides evidence that the inclusion of individualism-collectivism, social cognitive variables and gay community factors in the examination of homosexual identity and practice among men of different cultural backgrounds holds promise.

Four research aims were explored: community expectations of pre-hospital care, the existing organization of rural ambulance services, the measurement of ambulance service performance, and the comparative suitability of different pre-hospital models of service delivery. A unique feature was the use of soft systems methodology to develop the models of service delivery. It is one of the major non-traditional systems approaches to organisational research and lends itself to problem solving in the real world. The classic literature-hypothesis-experiment-results-conclusion model of research was not followed. Instead, policy and political analysis techniques were used as counter-points to the systems approach. The program of research employed a triangulation technique to adduce evidence from various sources in order to analyse ambulance services in rural Victoria. In particular, information from questionnaires, a focus group, interviews and performance data from the ambulance services themselves were used. These formed a rich dataset that provided new insight into rural ambulance services. Five service delivery models based on different worldviews were developed, each with its own characteristics, transformation processes and performance criteria. The models developed are titled: competitive; sufficing; community; expert; and practitioner. These conceptual models are presented as metaphors and in the form of holons and rich pictures, and then transformed into patient pathways for operational implementation. All five conceptual models meet the criteria for systemic desirability and were assessed for their political and cultural feasibility in a range of different rural communities. They provide a solid foundation for future discourse, debate and discussion about possible changes to the way pre-hospital services are delivered in rural Victoria.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ambulance</field><field name="subject">Rural Australia</field><field name="subject">Pre-hospital</field><field name="subject">Model</field><field name="subject">Soft Systems</field><field name="subject">Policy</field><field name="subject">Problem-solving</field><field name="subject">Ambulance service</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Emergency medical services</field><field name="subject">Rural medicine</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18771</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of bacterial oxidation of the copper sulphide mineral, covellite</field><field name="creator">Vanselow, Donald George, School of Biological Technology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this work was to determine whether a mechanism exists for bacterial oxidation of covellite (CuS) other than that involving cyclic reduction and oxidation of soluble iron, and to describe any such mechanism.It was thought likely that mechanisms of bacterial attack on CuS would also apply to other metal sulphides. High purity covellite was synthesized by the thermal reaction of sulphur and copper. Thiobacillus cultures were obtained from other workers and from the natural environment, and enriched for sulphide oxidizing capability.	Oxygen consumption was monitored polarographically. Soluble copper, sulphate and total iron were assayed by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry while ferrous ion was determind spectrophotometrically as a complex with orthophenanthroline.	By rapid specific inhibition of biological activity during sulphide oxidation, the contribution of bacteria to the stoichiometry of oxidation was determined. At pH 2.5 the product of either biological (Thiobaccillus ferrooxidans) or non-biological oxidation was CuSO4, the biological rate exceeding the non-biological rate about a hundredfold. At pH 4.5 T.thioparus was incapable of oxidizing CuS itself but catalysed attack by oxygen (about fivefold) by oxidizing a sulphur passivation film which formed by reaction of CuS with oxygen. The nett result was again CuSO4 production.	At pH 2.5 three strains of T. ferrooxidans oxidized CuS itself without the aid of ferric ion; a fourth strain (BJR-V-1) was completely dependent on ferric ion or dissolved oxygen to oxidize CuS to sulphur.	In situations where dissolved oxygen initiated the oxidation of CuS, the oxidation rate was approximately first order with respect to dissolved oxygen, while zero order kinetics were observed when other mechanisms predominated. 	In dilution experiments designed to demonstrate the dependence of sulphide oxidation (to sulphate) on physical contact between bacteria and mineral surfaces, no dependence was observed. It was concluded that water soluble intermediate were involved in CuS oxidation by T. ferrooxidans and in sulphur transport to the cells of T. ferrooxidans and T. thioparus. Arguments were advanced suggesting that the intermediates were inorganic and the concentration of intermediates was estimated from experimental results and the theory if diffusion.	The process of CuS passivation was studied; consumption of oxygen and acid, and production of cupric ion and sulphate were measured, the results indicating that passivation resulted from the accumulation of approximately 30 micromole of elemental sulphur per square metre of CuS. Oxygen consumed during depassivation by thiobacilli supported this conclusion. Assuming an even distribution of sulphur over the surface, the film was calculated to be one or two atoms thick.	From consideration of the results of this study it was proposed that polythionates may be involved both in CuS oxidation by bacteria and in transport of sulphur into bacterial cells.	The role of iron was investigated. Chemically synthesized ferric ion was less effective in CuS oxidation than was  ferric ion produced by T. ferrooxidans strain BJR-V-1 through oxidation of ferrous ion.	The half saturation ferrous ion concentration with respect to oxidation by each of the T. ferrooxidans strains was approximately 10-5 molar, in contrast to values of 10-2 molar reported by others. Further ferrous oxidation kinetic experiments with strain BJR-V-1 indicated that the major substrate for the rate limiting reaction in ferrous oxidation was a ferrous phosphate complex; a sulphate complex also played a part.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sulphide minerals</field><field name="subject">Oxidation</field><field name="subject">Physiological</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18781</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intrinsic magnetic aftereffect in Dy(Co,Ni)2 compounds</field><field name="creator">Carmichael, Christine Mary, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Measurements were made of the rate of magnetization, and the magnetization of the series of Dy (Co, Ni)2 compounds to investigate the intrinsic magnetic after effect. This effect is demonstrated by the existence of an intrinsic coercivity such that a critical value of applied field, Hc, must be reached before the domain walls can move freely through the material. However there is some movement of domain walls of fields below Hc, and this gives rise to time dependent magnetization. The mechanisms by which the domain walls overcome the energy barrier to their motion at fields below Hc was investigated in pulsed field, and in steady fields. After measuring the critical field and magnetic moments of each sample, the pulsed field magnetometer results were analysed to show that there is a certain temperature above which the mechanism for domain wall motion appears to be that described by Taylor???s thermal activation model. Below that particular temperature, the magnetization rate depends on the reciprocal of the applied field, and an empirical model is suggested. Estimates are made of the number of spines contained in the average wall kink; the wall jump frequency and the energy barrier. A vibrating sample magnetometer was used to study the magnetization of the specimens in steady fields. The results indicate that both the mechanisms described above are in operation, with thermal activation being a possibility at temperatures as low as 4.2K.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Magnetism</field><field name="subject">Domain structure</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18161</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Irrigation and Fertilization on the Belowground Carbon Allocation in a Pine Plantation</field><field name="creator">Pongracic, Silvia, School of Biological Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aboveground and belowground productivity of forest systems are interlinked through complex feedback loops involving tree, soil and environmental factors.  With a predicted significant change in environmental conditions through the enhanced greenhouse effect, it is important to understand the response of forest systems to these new conditions.  An increase in atmospheric CO2 is predicted to increase photosynthesis, and therefore whole plant productivity at the individual tree level.   However this increase in photosynthesis may result in greater requirements for nutrients, particularly nitrogen (N).  In order to acquire any additional available N, trees may respond by increasing their proportional allocation of C belowground to the root system.  This study aimed to quantify the belowground C allocation in a mature forest system consisting of a single species on a single site, but with different levels of water and nutrient stress.  The belowground carbon dynamics of a range of irrigated and fertilized Pinus radiata stands in Australia were investigated during 1992 and 1993.   Belowground carbon allocation was estimated using the model proposed by Raich and Nadelhoffer (1989) where belowground C allocation is the difference between soil respiration and carbon input through litterfall, plus coarse root production and an adjustment for any change in soil and litter layer carbon pools.  This model is best described by the equation: Belowground C = Csoilresp ?? Clitterfall + Ccoarseroot+ ???Cforest floor+ ???Csoil    Soil respiration, measured using a modified soda lime absorption method either every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks for 2 years, showed a range in daily soil C flux from 137 ?? 785 mgCO2.m-2.h-1.  Soil respiration showed seasonal trends with summer highs and winter lows.   Limited fine root biomass data could not indicate a strong relationship between measured soil respiration and fine root (&amp;gt2mm diameter) biomass.   Fifty three percent of the variation in soil respiration measurements in irrigated treatments was explained by a linear relationship between soil respiration, and soil temperature at 0.10 m depth and litter moisture content.   In non-irrigated treatments, 61% of the variation in soil  xix respiration measurements was explained by a linear relationship between soil temperature at 1 cm depth and soil moisture content.  Inter-year variation was considerable with annual soil respiration approximately 20% lower in 1993 compared with 1992.  Annual soil C flux was calculated by linear interpolation and ranged from 3.4 ?? 11.2 tC ha-1 across the treatments.  Soil C pools remained unchanged over 10 years between 1983 and 1993 for all combinations of irrigated and fertilized stands, despite significant aboveground productivity differences over the decade.  Measurements of standing litter showed a change between 1991 and 1993 for only 2 out of the 10 treatments.  These two treatments had belowground C allocation estimated both with and without an adjustment for a change in standing litter.  Annual litterfall C ranged almost four fold from 0.6 ?? 2.2 tC ha-1 between the treatments in 1992 and 1993, and fell within the ranges of measured litterfall over 10 years at the field site.  Again inter-year variation was large, with the 1993 litterfall values being approximately 97% greater across all treatments compared with 1992 values.    Belowground carbon allocation was calculated using C fluxes measured at the field site, and ranged 3 fold from 4.4 ?????? 12.9 tC ha-1 between the treatments during 1992 and 1993.  In 1993 the belowground C allocation was approximately 30% lower across all treatments compared with 1992 calculations.  This was due to an approximate 23% reduction in annual soil C flux, a 97% increase in litterfall C and an 18% reduction in coarse root production between 1992 and 1993.  The field site was N limited, and differences in belowground C allocation could be shown across irrigated treatments with different N limitations.  As N availability increased belowground C allocation was decreased in the irrigated treatments.  It was difficult to determine differences in belowground C allocation caused by water stress as the effects of water and N limitation were confounded.  An increase in N availability generally indicated an increase in coarse root and litterfall C production, which were reflected in increased aboveground productivity.  In high N treatments the coarse root fraction of belowground C allocation comprised approximately 50% of the total belowground C allocation, whereas in the N stressed treatments coarse roots only comprised 20% of the total belowground allocation  The mechanistic model BIOMASS was used to estimate annual gross primary productivity (GPP) for the different treatments at the field site.  BIOMASS estimated GPPs of between 30-38 tC ha-1 for the different treatments during 1992 and 1993.  The measured belowground carbon allocation ranged from 16 ?? 40 % of simulated GPP, with the lower proportion allocated belowground in the irrigated and high fertility stands.  Aboveground competition through the absence of thinning also appeared to reduce allocation belowground in non- irrigated stands.    A direct trade off between bole and belowground C could not be demonstrated, unless data were separated by year and by the presence or absence of irrigation.  Where data were separated in this manner, only three data points defined the reasonably strong, negative relationship between bole and belowground C.  The value of this relationship is highly questionable and should be interpreted with caution.  Thus a decrease in belowground C allocation may not necessarily indicate a concomitant increase in bole C allocation.    Inter-year variation in a number of C pools and fluxes measured at the field site was at least as great as the variation between stands having different water and N limitation.  Extrapolation of belowground productivity estimates from a single years data should be undertaken cautiously.    The work undertaken in this study indicated that for a given forest stand in a given soil type, an increase in N availability reduced the absolute and relative C allocated belowground.   However this decrease in C belowground may not directly translate as an increase in stem growth or increased timber production.    Forest productivity in an enhanced greenhouse environment is likely to result in an increased allocation of C belowground due to increased N limitation, unless adequate N is present to support a more active canopy.  Further work is required to more fully understand the dynamics of the belowground system in a changing environment.  However further research should focus on mature forest systems in order to isolate the impacts of natural ageing changes from perturbation effects on the forest system.  This would be best undertaken in long term monitoring sites where a C history of the stand may be available.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pinus radiata Soils</field><field name="subject">Atmospheric carbon dioxide</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18164</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An informetric study of the distribution of bibliographic records in online databases: a case study using the literature of Fuzzy Set Theory (1965-1993)</field><field name="creator">Hood, William, School of Information Library &amp; Archive Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study investigated the distribution of bibliographic records amongst online bibliographic databases. The topic of Fuzzy Set Theory over the period of 1965 to 1993 was chosen to provide the case study for this investigation. From the DIALOG database host, searches were conducted on 114 databases to determine the number of journal article records relating to the topic of Fuzzy Sets. Both the number of records in each database, as well as the overlap of coverage between the databases were calculated. Six counting techniques were developed to allocate records to databases based on different methods for handling records that were duplicated between databases. When duplicate records are included, the top database accounts for 19% of the records; when duplicates are removed, the top database was found to account for 37% of the records. The distribution of records in databases was found to conform to the Bradford-Zipf hyperbolic distribution. Various other analyses were undertaken including: the duplicate records themselves, the total size of the DIALOG database system over time and the density of Fuzzy Set records in databases over time. A secondary aim of this study was to perform an informetric study on the literature of Fuzzy Set Theory itself. Results obtained include an analysis of the growth of the Fuzzy Set literature, an analysis of the journals covering the topic of Fuzzy Sets, an analysis of the terminology used in describing topics related to Fuzzy Sets. Also, the Ulrich's database was used to provide a subject classification of the journals to analyse the diffusion of the topic of Fuzzy Sets into other disciplines. Apart from the discipline of mathematics, the top disciplines into which Fuzzy Sets have diffused were found to be applied physics, systems and computing. The third aim of the thesis was to refine and develop the methodology used to perform large scale informetric studies using data from a variety of online bibliographic databases. Commercially available software was used wherever possible, but where this was not possible or infeasible, custom written programs were developed to perform various steps in the methodology.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bibliometrics</field><field name="subject">informetrics</field><field name="subject">bibliographic databases</field><field name="subject">fuzzy set theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18184</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Hepatitis C Virus Epidemics in Australia</field><field name="creator">Gao, Zhanhai, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the mathematical modelling for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemics in Australia.  There are two parts to this thesis. Part I is aimed at modelling the transmission of HIV and HCV via needle sharing among injecting drug users (IDUs). The dynamical model of an epidemic through needle sharing among IDUs is derived. This model reveals the correlation between  needle sharing and the epidemic prevalence among IDUs. The simulations of HIV and HCV prevalence and incidence among IDUs in Australia are made with this model. The comparison of simulated results with literature estimates shows that the modelled results are consistent with the literature estimates. The effects of needle sharing and cleaning on HIV and HCV prevalence and incidence among IDUs in Australia are evaluated. Part II is devoted to modelling the spread of HIV in the general community in Australia. A mathematical model is formulated to assess the epidemiological consequences of injecting drug use and sexual transmission in Australia. The effects of highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) on the HIV epidemic are included. The modelled results are in broad agreement with the literature estimates and observed data.

There is a lack of comprehensive analysis of the holographic representational system within art related theoretical and critical writing and a tendency to analyse individual works only in terms of generalities which apply to the concepts surrounding the holographic medium. While these form an important background for art image production, in some cases corresponding to artists works, the existing written material on the subject is inadequate as a model from which to draw the all important temporal conclusions.  To date the critical reception of holograms has made no mention of acuity, the size of the viewing frustum, the depth of the image and scant mention of interference phenomena which are the intrinsic factors which I believe precipitate temporal illusions. Therefore this thesis examines the concrete holographic image in great detail on its own terms, firstly through theories of the basic image forming phenomena of interference and diffraction and secondly through the techniques of production as they have been adapted for the making of my art works. The extent of the metaphorical and allegorical potential of the spatial and temporal properties of the concrete holographic image are put to the ultimate test in a commission for St Brigid???s Church, Coogee. The Shrine of the Sacred Heart commission for St Brigid???s requires a concrete holographic image to facilitate devotion to the Sacred Heart.

Consulting first the archival record, this thesis establishes the presence of 230 women architects qualified and/or practising in NSW between 1900 and 1960. It then analyses some of these early women architects' achievements and difficulties in the profession, drawing on interviews with 70 practitioners or their friends and family. Finally it offers brief biographical accounts of eight leading early women architects, arguing that their achievements deserve more widespread historical attention in an adjusted canon of architectural merit. There are also 152 illustrations evidencing their design contributions. Thus the research draws on quantitative, qualitative, biographical and visual modes of representation in establishing a historical presence for these early women architects. The thesis forms part of the widespread political project of feminist historical recovery of women forebears, while also interrogating the ends and means of such historiography. The various threads describing women's absence and presence in the architectural profession are woven together throughout the thesis using three feminist approaches which sometimes harmonise and sometimes debate with each other. Described as "liberal feminism", "socialist feminism" and "postmodern feminism", they each put into play distinct patterns of questioning, method and interpretation, but all analyse historiography as a strategy for understanding society and effecting social change.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women architects</field><field name="subject">feminist theory</field><field name="subject">Australian architectural history</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">women-owned architectural firms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the processes underlying implicit learning</field><field name="creator">Newell, Ben, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the processes underlying implicit learning. Six candidate components thought to be involved in implicit learning were identified: task demands, affordances of experimental materials, subjects????? intentions, content of knowledge, form of representation and awareness. A series of 15 experiments are reported that investigated the learning in the invariant digit, invariant clocks, and the artificial grammar task in an attempt to determine the role of these six components. The empirical findings were interpreted as supporting the view that learning under implicit task conditions: i) is interactive and not passive, ii) does not result in the acquisition of a default representation of knowledge, but that any structure remains latent within an experience until appropriate retrieval cues are provided at test, and iii) does not proceed ?????outside????? awareness but that the lack of insight that often accompanies learning is due to poor understanding about the basis of performance. A framework was proposed that demonstrated how this pattern of objective performance and subjective experience arises, through the interaction of the candidate components. This framework is more consistent with a process-oriented view (e.g. Whittlesea &amp; Wright, 1997) than a separate systems account of implicit learning (e.g. Reber, 1989).</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Implicit learning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The management of change in six Victorian secondary colleges</field><field name="creator">Daniels, Ray, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study explored change in six Victorian secondary colleges some four years into the major school-system change program known as ?????Schools of the Future?????.   The purpose of the study was to identify successful models and practices for positive school change by exploring school change from the school level perspective.    A focus of the investigation was an organizational development program designed by a North American professor of organization and management in which Victorian school principals were trained as their schools entered the ?????Schools of the Future????? program. The project was guided initially by four major research questions to which six additional research questions were added as the research progressed.	The research methodology was qualitative.  The data for this investigation were collected in 1997.  The main means of gathering them was the in-depth interview of the principals of the six schools in the study and of the four members of staff they nominated as knowledgeable about their school?????s change processes.  A follow-up questionnaire to the interview, a telephone questionnaire that asked principals for background information about their schools, and a study of school documents were also sources of data.	The analysis and interpretation of the data related to charge in the schools was presented in the forms of six case studies and a multisite study.  	Eleven variables and eighteen insights identified the aspects associated with successful change across the sites.  The study?????s three major findings identified the critical importance in the success of change of the school?????s organizational culture and individual participants in change processes, its relationship to elements in its external environment and the nature of its planning for change. A theoretical framework for positive school change environments was developed.   It combined the elements associated with successful change in the study.  This framework may prove useful as a basis for further research on systemic change in schools and as a point of reference for those actually engaged in leading the change process in schools and school systems.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">high schools</field><field name="subject">Victorian high schools</field><field name="subject">administration</field><field name="subject">secondary education</field><field name="subject">educational change</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of ocean tides</field><field name="creator">Das, Pritha, School of Methematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis three independent studies of tidal dynamics have been pesented. The  first is an analytical study of continental shelf tides forced at the ocean boundary. Earlier studies have shown that the response for a sloping shelf and a flat shelf differ and that the response for a flat shelf changes when tides are incident at an angle. Other studies considered a sloping shelf but they did not take into account a possible non-zero depth at a coastal wall. This study shows that the effects of a sloping shelf, a coastal wall and obliquely incident tides an all significantly modify the response on the shelf. The modification increases with the width of the shelf, and in a wide shelf scenario, near resonance, it greatly modifies the response. Secondly, the Princeton Ocean Model in barotropic mode along with a tracer transport module has been used to study the tides of Sydney Harbour. The tidally induced residual circulation due to the semi-diurnal tide consists of a series of recirculating gyres which are due to the interaction of flow with topography. This study shows that in the harbour it is the Lagrangian residual velocity not the Eulerian residual velocity which determines the net transport  of material over a tidal cycle. In addition, the flushing time of the harbour varies significantly in space, and the tidal mixing is restricted in the vicinity of the entrance. The third is a theoretical study of forced oscillations in a rotating, flat-bottomed, circular basin. This study shows that the direction of propagation of waves in a basin depends on the ratio of its radius to depth. At each latitude there is a critical value of this ratio and this value decreases with increase in latitude. Beyond this value, waves start to propagate around the basin in the opposite direction to the earth ???s rotation (clockwise in the northern hemisphere and anti-clockwise in the southern hemisphere).The presence of friction increases this critical value which shows that friction plays an important role in determining the response.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tides</field><field name="subject">mathemetical models</field><field name="subject">oceans</field><field name="subject">dynamics</field><field name="subject">continental shelf</field><field name="subject">Sydney Habour</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indigenous rights under the Australian constitution : a reconciliation perspective</field><field name="creator">Malbon, Justin, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the possibilities for building a reconciliatory jurisprudence for the protection of indigenous rights under the Australian Constitution.  The thesis first examines what could be meant by the term ???reconciliation??? in a legal context and argues that it requires (1) acknowledgement of and atonement for past wrongdoing, (2) the provision of recompense, and (3) the establishment of legal and constitutional structures designed to ensure that similar wrongs are not repeated in the future.  The thesis focuses on the last of these three requirements.  It is further argued that developing a reconciliatory jurisprudence first requires the courts to free themselves from the dominant paradigm of strict positivism so that they are liberated to pay due regard to questions of morality.  	Given this framework, the thesis then sets out to examine the purpose and scope of the race power (section 51(xxvi)) of the Australian Constitution, with particular regard to the case of Kartinyeri v Commonwealth in which the High Court directly considered the power.  The thesis concludes that the majority of the Court had not, for various reasons, properly considered the nature of the power.  An appropriate ruling, it is argued, should find that the power does not enable Parliament to discriminate adversely against racial minorities.  	The thesis then proceeds to consider whether there are implied terms under the Constitution that protect fundamental rights.  It is argued that these rights are indeed protected because the Constitution is based upon the rule of law.  In addition constitutional provisions are to be interpreted subject to the presumption that its terms are not to be understood as undermining fundamental rights unless a constitutional provision expressly states otherwise.  The thesis also considers whether there is an implied right to equality under the Constitution.  The conclusion drawn is that such a right exists and that it is both procedural and substantive in nature.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">civil rights</field><field name="subject">government relations</field><field name="subject">legal status</field><field name="subject">discrimination in justice administration</field><field name="subject">race relations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To labour seriously : Catholic sisters and social welfare in late nineteenth century Sydney</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Lesley Patricia, School of Social Work, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the social welfare work of four Catholic Sisterhoods in Sydney in the late nineteenth century.  The work of Catholic women religious is largely missing from Australian women???s history and the history of social welfare and social work in Australia.  The present investigation seeks to add to knowledge of women???s agency in Australian society and to extend the knowledge of Australian social work history. The aim of the thesis is to understand what the Sisters were attempting to do in their work with the poor of Sydney and how they went about it.  The emphasis is on understanding the Sisters??? work from their own perspective, particularly the values which underpinned their work and the resources and constraints which affected it.  A qualitative, inductive approach is used in which the data are drawn mainly from the Sisterhoods??? narratives and other historical documents.  The thesis does  not aim to test particular theoretical propositions, but rather to contribute to a number of ???unfolding stories??? about the history of Australian social work, about women???s work in the public realm, and about the development of the caring professions The thesis argues that the social welfare work of four Sydney Sisterhoods had a number of characteristics which made it unusual for the time, and which constituted it as ???proto-professional???.  These included the codification of the prescribed stance towards the poor, of methods of work, and a high level of expertise in administration and management.  The Sisters??? approach pre-figured later social work in a number of respects including an inclusive and accepting stance, respect for the dignity of the individual, and a concern to develop individuals??? capacities and self-esteem.  The professionalism of the Sisters??? work is shown to be related to features which were integral to Catholic women???s religious institutes and to their role and status in the Catholic Church of the day. The Sisters??? social welfare work did not ???evolve??? into secular, professional social work however.  It is contended that reasons for this were related to developments in Australian society, the situation of the local Catholic Church and restrictions on membership of the Sisterhoods.  The thesis has significance for bodies of knowledge on ???woman???s sphere??? charity in the late nineteenth century, the history of social work in Australia, and theory on the professionalisation of caring occupations.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social welfare</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">19th century</field><field name="subject">Church and social problems</field><field name="subject">Catholic Church</field><field name="subject">Nuns</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Powers and responsibilities: reforming NSW criminal investigation law</field><field name="creator">Alderson, Karl, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis is a historical study from a socio-legal perspective of debates about, and developments in, criminal investigation law in NSW since 1945. In that period, the NSW parliament has enacted extensive criminal investigation powers and safeguards. This can be seen as the result of the increasing political sensitivity of 'law and order'. Politicians have sought to exercise (and demonstrate) greater control over the criminal justice system. Legislation has been employed to provide a framework for police actions, and to define a role for others, including judges, magistrates and the Ombudsman.  Political focus on law and order has also reversed the incentive structure for the police hierarchy. In the 1950s, there were strong incentives not to push for extra powers, lest policing practices and effectiveness receive unwanted scrutiny. In the 1970s, police were dragged into debate about their powers, in the face of the 'authorise and regulated' model suggested by numerous inquiries. More recently, police organisations have often initiated calls for new powers, in part to explain past failings.  Another important factor driving debate and reform in recent decades has been the proliferation of oversight agencies, and academic insights that have debunked the 'rotten apple' paradigm. The Federal Government and Parliament have also been increasingly active in what would once have been considered purely State/Territory realms of criminal justice law and politics. These major influences have been coupled with a host of others, including the impact of a series of Royal Commission and law reform reports, the ongoing war on drugs, and the campaign against police verbals in the 1970s and 1980s.  The examination of the forces that have influenced debate and reform yields other insights. For example, the complexity of the phenomenon of 'non-reform' is apparent from an examination of debates about policing in the 1950s. Prevailing trends in law and order politics (eg, that populist politics supports additional powers) can be seen to be anchored in the contemporary political context rather than being timeless truths. The multiple roles of law, in governing relationships between state agencies and actors, not just between police and suspects, are also highlighted.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Criminal investigation</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Law reform</field><field name="subject">Police power</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using epidemiology to inform classification in psychiatry</field><field name="creator">Slade, Tim, Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Classification systems in psychiatry are a work in progress. Therefore, continued efforts to improve their validity are necessary. Epidemiology provides a scientific method to assess the extent of psychiatric morbidity in community populations. However, data from epidemiological surveys have also contributed, either directly or indirectly, to many changes in the classification systems. Recent reviews of the current state of psychiatric classification indicate four unresolved issues: 1) the presence of two differing classification systems, 2) the role of the clinical significance criterion in differentiating psychopathology from normality, 3) the relationship of the exclusion criteria to the co-occurrence of psychiatric disorder pairs, and 4) the relative validity of categorical versus dimensional conceptualizations of psychiatric disorders. The current thesis examines these four unresolved issues, using data from a large-scale epidemiological survey of psychiatric disorders. With regard to GAD, differences in diagnostic criteria between DSM-IV and ICD-10 resulted in different types of cases identified, despite similarities in prevalence. The DSM-IV diagnostic criterion for clinical significance impacted, albeit to different degrees, on the prevalence, health service use and impairment of five disorders. The exclusion criteria in both DSM-IV and ICD-10 were significantly related to the patterns of co-occurrence found in the data. Using the example of depression, symptoms were more consistent with a dimensional rather than a categorical structure. A specific research agenda is proposed, the aim of which is to provide possible avenues of research that may benefit revisions to classification systems and the conduct of epidemiological surveys. This research agenda contains a number of suggestions. Future revisions will benefit from an explicit understanding of the differences between the classification systems. Better definitions of the concepts of clinical significance and psychiatric disorder are required. The co-occurrence of disorder pairs in epidemiological data informs understanding of the exclusion criteria, but the validity of these criteria relies on different data. Dimensional models of classification may yield more information than categorical models, and methods for incorporating them in large-scale surveys are proposed. It is concluded that epidemiological data should continue to play a significant part in the refinement of psychiatric classification.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psychiatric classification</field><field name="subject">epidemiology</field><field name="subject">DSM-IV</field><field name="subject">ICD-10</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self and subject in eighteenth century diaries</field><field name="creator">Martin, Julia, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates new ways of reading eighteenth century British diaries and argues that these narratives do not necessarily rely upon the idea of the self as a single, unitary source of meaning. This contradicts what has traditionally been viewed as the very essence of autobiography (Gusdorf, 1954; Olney, 1980, 1988). Close readings of the diaries of John Wesley, Mrs Housman, James Boswell and Hannah Ball (all written between 1720 and 1795) show that they construct 'generalised', rather than 'unique' subjects of narrative. The self is seen to be an amalgam of common characteristic more than being a core of psychological impulses.  In order to understand the 'generalised' rather than 'unique' subject found in these diaries, this thesis surveys and uses reading strategies informed by theories that can accommodate fragmented narrative forms like diaries. It also investigates the religious and philosophical underpinnings of eighteenth century autobiographical narratives to determine how the self, and consciousness, were popularly perceived in the period known as the Enlightenment (c. 1690-1810).  As they are often marked by missing pages, deletions and heavy editing, careful strategies are required in order to 'read with' eighteenth century diary narratives (Sandoval, 1981; Huff, 2000; Raoul, 2001). This practice invites an engagement with philosophical debates about 'self'-the living human being who writes the diary, and the 'subject'-the 'I' produced by narrative. The thesis argues that more than any other type of written narrative, diaries demand an acknowledgement that the subject of narrative does refer to a self that lives in day-to-day relations. Not to acknowledge this is to 'write off experience altogether' (Probyn,1991:111) and exclude the political dimensions of autobiography from the analysis.  The thesis concludes that by seeking to answer the questions of 'What am I?' and 'What are we?' rather than the Romantic or psychological question of 'Who am I?', eighteenth century diary narratives create complex relationships between time, subjective and narrative that transcend most theorisations of autobiography to date. This presents an exciting direction forward for a field of scholarship that has been overly concerned with defining its limitations.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English literature</field><field name="subject">18th century</field><field name="subject">History and criticism</field><field name="subject">Diaries</field><field name="subject">Self in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18787</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimization of reverse osmosis membrane networks</field><field name="creator">Maskan, Fazilet, Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The optimization of a reverse osmosis (RO) system includes optimization of the design of the individual membrane modules, the system structure and the operating conditions of the system. Most previous studies considered either the optimal design of individual modules only or optimization of system structure and operating conditions for fixed module dimensions. This thesis developed a method to simultaneously optimize the module dimensions, system structure and operating conditions. The method comprised rules for generating a general superstructure for an RO system given the number of modules along with rules for generating technically and mathematically feasible sub-structures. The superstructure was based on maximum connectivity between unit operations. A connectivity matrix was used to represent the superstructure. The matrix was useful for checking sub-structure's feasibility and deriving a model for the sub-structure's optimization, comprising the minimum number of variables and constraints which minimized computational time and increased accuracy. For optimization, a nonlinear objective function of the annualized profit of the RO system was formulated, consisting of the revenue obtained from permeate sales, capital costs of the unit operations and operating costs for the system. It was found that RO system optimization is a nonconvex optimization problem. The most effective optimization procedure involved a combination of evolutionary computation, which was good for locating the global optimum, and a gradient-based method, which was superior in finding the exact optimum. Small population size, adaptive mutation rate and steady state replacement were the most efficient parameter settings for the evolutionary computation. Optimal design of two-stage RO systems with and without energy recovery, bypass and recycle streams was studied. Dimensions of predicted optimal modules approached those of current commercial modules but with much shorter feed channels. The mathematical optimum also had higher operating pressures. The optimum system structure was a series arrangement with different module dimensions in each stage. A sensitivity analysis showed that trends in the optimal design were similar when unit costs changed.  An investigation of the scalability of the method for a three-stage RO system revealed several weaknesses. These are probably surmountable with the addition of more RO system specific knowledge.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reverse osmosis networks</field><field name="subject">nonlinear optimization</field><field name="subject">membrane filters</field><field name="subject">reverse osmosis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and evaluation of passive variable-pitch vertical axis wind turbines</field><field name="creator">Pawsey, N.C.K., Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Vertical-axis wind turbines do not need to be oriented to the wind direction and offer direct rotary output to a ground-level load, making them particularly suitable for water pumping, heating, purification and aeration, as well as stand-alone electricity generation. The use of high-efficiency Darrieus turbines for such applications is virtually prohibited by their inherent inability to self-start. The provision of blade-articulation (variable-pitch blades) has been demonstrated by a number of researchers to make Darrieus turbines self-starting. One aim of this thesis is to evaluate the various concepts manifested in the numerous specific passive variable-pitch designs appearing in the literature, often without theoretical analysis. In the present work, two separate mathematical models have been produced to predict the performance of passive variable-pitch Darrieus-type turbines. A blade-element/momentum theory model has been used to investigate the relationships between the key parameter values and turbine steady-state performance. A strategy for parameter selection has been developed on the basis of these results. A free vortex wake model for passive variable-pitch turbines has been developed, allowing the study of unsteady performance. Significant reduction of average ef- ficiency in a turbulent wind is predicted for a Darrieus turbine. The improved low-speed torque of passive variable-pitch turbines is predicted to significantly improve turbulent wind performance. Two new design concepts for passive variable-pitch turbines are presented that are intended to allow greater control of blade pitch behaviour and improved turbulent wind performance. A prototype turbine featuring these design concepts has been designed, constructed and tested in the wind tunnel. As part of this testing, a technique has been developed for measuring the pitch angle response of one of the turbine blades in operation. This allows comparison of predicted and measured pitch histories and gives insight into the performance of turbines of this type. Results have demonstrated the usefulness of the mathematical models as design tools and have indicated the potential of one of the new design concepts in particular to make a vertical axis wind turbine self-starting.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wind turbines</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exercise and left ventricular function in chronic mitral valve insufficiency</field><field name="creator">Leung, Dominic Y. C., South Western Sydney Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">The projects of this thesis examine the complex interaction between isotonic exercise, functional capacity, exercise-induced myocardial ischaemia, severity of regurgitation and left ventricular function in patients with significant chronic mitral regurgitation. The concept of left ventricular contractile reserve, i.e. the ability of the left ventricle to increase its contractility and decrease its end systolic volume with isotonic exercise, is explored. In patients with chronic isolated mitral regurgitation without coronary disease, isotonic exercise was associated with a slight decrease in left ventricular end diastolic volume but a marked decrease in end systolic volume, resulting in a significant increase in the stroke volume and ejection fraction. Early after uncomplicated mitral valve repair surgery, there was a significant decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction with a proportion of the patients developing left ventricular dysfunction despite a normal pre-operative ejection fraction. When different pre-operative echocardiographic indices of left ventricular function were evaluated for their ability to predict left ventricular function after mitral valve repair, the exercise indices were found to be superior to resting indices. Left ventricular end systolic volume immediately after exercise was found to be the best predictor. The optimal cut-off was at 25 ml/m2, which had a sensitivity and specificity of 83% in predicting early post-operative left ventricular dysfunction. Exercise indices appeared to be superior to resting indices in identifying patients with persistent left ventricular dysfunction &amp;lt1 year after mitral valve repair. The concept of contractile reserve was further examined by estimating the left ventricular stroke work from simplified pressure-volume loops, which were constructed from non-invasively obtained parameters with geometric assumptions. Left ventricular stroke work immediately after exercise, but not at rest, was found to be significantly lower in patients with latent left ventricular dysfunction. Patients without latent ventricular dysfunction had similar increases in stroke work with exercise compared with healthy normal subjects. The ability of the left ventricle to increase its stroke work with exercise, a measure of the contractile reserve, was correlated with the left ventricular ejection fraction after mitral valve repair. A numerical model was constructed using the clinical data as input parameters. The results from the numerical model were similar to that obtained from the clinical study, testifying that the observation made in the clinical study was valid and independent of the geometric assumptions made in constructing the simplified pressure-volume loops. Left ventricular pressure-volume loops under different loading conditions were plotted from simultaneously measured left ventricular pressure and volume to measure the left ventricular end systolic elastance (Ees) and preload recruitable stroke work relationship (MSW). Despite normal or near normal haemodynamics at rest, a significant proportion of the study patients were found to have impaired left ventricular contractility, as measured by Ees, consistent with a state of latent left ventricular dysfunction. Exercise indices of left ventricular function were better correlated with Ees and MSW than resting indices. There were highly significant inverse relationships between end systolic volume index immediately after exercise and Ees and MSW. Moreover, there was a significant powered relationship between MSW and exercise left ventricular ejection fraction. There was no such relationship between Ees or MSW and any of the resting echocardiographic indices of left ventricular function. Furthermore, the optimal diagnostic cut-off level of end systolic volume index after exercise at 25 ml/m2 accurately identified those with impaired left ventricular contractility as defined by an Ees of &amp;gt 2 mmHg/ml. In patients with chronic organic mitral regurgitation with ejection fraction of &amp;lt 50%, objectively measured functional capacity, VO2max, was correlated with exercise cardiac output, patient age and gender but not to the severity of the mitral regurgitation or the resting left ventricular function. The VO2max of these patients were significantly lower than that of age and gender-matched healthy controls despite these patients' relative lack of subjective symptoms. There were significant individual variations in the response of the severity of the mitral regurgitation to isotonic exercise. Patients whose regurgitant stroke volume increased had a lower exercise cardiac output than those whose regurgitant stroke volume decreased. Such variability was also seen with the response of the left ventricular function to exercise. Patients whose left ventricular end systolic volume increased with exercise, i.e. patients with a limited contractile reserve, had a lower exercise cardiac output and lower VO2max than those whose end systolic volume decreased with exercise. The determinants of exercise capacity were then examined in patients with functional mitral regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction. VO2max of these patients was correlated with exercise cardiac output and exercise left ventricular ejection fraction, a situation similar to that seen in patients with organic mitral regurgitation and normal left ventricular function. Furthermore, indices of left ventricular systolic function at rest and pulsed wave Doppler indices of diastolic function showed no significant correlations with VO2max. The determinants of VO2max remained unchanged in these patients after four weeks of supervised exercise training. The four weeks of exercise training resulted in a significant decrease in left ventricular end systolic volume, a trend towards an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction and some restoration of the contractile reserve. The total exercise time almost doubled. However, this dramatic improvement in total exercise time was accompanied only by non-significant increases in VO2max and left ventricular ejection fraction. Therefore, the benefits of exercise training in these patients may involve more than just central mechanisms. Exercise induced myocardial ischaemia may also contribute to a limited left ventricular contractile reserve in patients with mitral regurgitation. Electrocardiographic changes at rest are commonly seen in patients with mitral regurgitation due to mitral valve prolapse. These resting electrocardiographic changes make exercise electrocardiography uninterpretable for exercise-induced ischaemia. Exercise electrocardiographic changes are also commonly encountered in these patients despite the absence of coronary artery disease and a normal resting electrocardiogram, making exercise electrocardiography unreliable as a non-invasive screening test for coronary artery disease. In these patients, exercise echocardiography was slightly more sensitive but significantly more specific in diagnosing significant coronary artery disease. The overall accuracy and the positive predictive value were significantly higher for exercise echocardiography than for exercise electrocardiography. The &amp;quotcost-effectiveness&amp;quot of different diagnostic strategies for coronary artery disease in patients with mitral valve prolapse was examined based on the results of the clinical study. Strategies involving exercise electrocardiography as part of the screening test were costly and were associated with a high false negative rate. Strategies involving exercise echocardiography were more accurate and less costly but the initial costs of exercise echocardiography for all patients meant that the overall costs were still considerable. Assessing the pre-test probability of coronary artery disease in these patients and using exercise echocardiography as the initial test for patients with at least a moderate pre-test probability of coronary artery disease seemed to result in the best compromise between cost and effectiveness. The studies of this thesis have shown that a limited cardiac contractile reserve is a sign of latent ventricular dysfunction in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation. The presence of a limited contractile reserve can be used to predict left ventricular dysfunction after mitral valve repair. The concept of a limited contractile reserve is further supported by the finding of a limited increase in left ventricular stroke work with exercise from a theoretical as well as a numerical model of left ventricular pressure-volume loops. Exercise echocardiographic indices show better correlations to invasively measured Ees and MSW than resting indices. VO2max in these patients is determined more by their ability to increase their forward cardiac output with exercise and not by the regurgitant volumes. Exercise training in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and functional mitral regurgitation results in some restoration of contractile reserve. Exercise echocardiography is also a reliable and cost-effective test in the non-invasive screening for coronary artery disease in these patients. Based on the results of the studies in the thesis, one can incorporate exercise echocardiography as one of the important assessment tools in the management of patients with significant mitral regurgitation as it allows measurement of left ventricular volumes and assessment of contractile reserve. Further studies are needed to examine whether a policy of monitoring of contractile reserve in these patients to guide therapy and surgical referral will result in a better preservation of long term left ventricular function, an improvement in functional capacity and patient outcome.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ventricular function</field><field name="subject">mitral valve insufficiency</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="subject">physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">heart</field><field name="subject">ventricles</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radio frequency and microwave design methods for mobile communications</field><field name="creator">Banciu, Marian Gabriel, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Global System for Mobile communications (GSM), which covers 54% of the world's mobile market, evolved into the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS).

Experimentation was carried out using controlled flux experiments and fouling phenomena was investigated via the monitoring of the transmembrane pressure (TMP) and rejection. Electron microscopy was employed to study fouling on microfiltration membranes when single protein solutions were filtered while a novel method involving Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) was developed to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse mixed proteins fouled on ultrafiltration membranes. An apparent critical flux was identified whereby fouling was shown to occur at fluxes where there was no increase in TMP. TMP increase is one of the common indicators of fouling in controlled flux operation. Microfiltration experiments showed that the imposition of the apparent critical flux is accompanied by rapid increases in hydraulic resistance and the membrane wall concentration. Pore blockage and narrowing occurred at somewhat higher fluxes as indicated by increases in the observed rejection. Fouling was not influenced greatly by the addition of electrolytes for microfiltration membranes but observed transmissions were found to be greater than 100% when ultrafiltration membranes were employed. For all membranes used, the actual value of the apparent critical flux was shown to be independent of the salt concentration but dependent on pH. Sub apparent-critical constant flux microfiltration showed the existence of an aggregation/deposition time lag after which the membrane experiences a rapid increase in resistance due to protein aggregates blocking a majority of pores. This phenomenon was shown to be dependent on pH and ionic strength and was concluded to be the product of a balance between electrostatic, solubility and hydrophobic interactions.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Protein fouling</field><field name="subject">Critical flux</field><field name="subject">MALDI</field><field name="subject">ultrafiltration</field><field name="subject">microfiltration</field><field name="subject">fouling</field><field name="subject">proteins</field><field name="subject">membrane separation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18832</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cellular mechanisms of QT prolongation and proarrhythmia induced by non-antiarrhythmic drugs</field><field name="creator">Tie, Hii  Hui, Clinical School - St. Vincents, UNSW</field><field name="description">A variety of drugs prolong cardiac repolarization (manifested as QT prolongation on ECG), although the major example are the so-called class III antiarrhythmics. However, antiarrhythmic drugs which prolong cardiac repolarization are not harmless, as they may also be proarrhythmic, inducing a potentially fatal arrhythmia known as torsade de pointes (TdP). Recently, it has become apparent that a wide variety of non-antiarrhythmic agents may also, as an entirely undesired side-effect, provoke TdP. TdP is also characteristic of the congenital long QT syndrome, one form of which is caused by mutations in the HERG gene which encodes the major repolarizing potassium channel, IKr. Furthermore, HERG appears to be the main molecular target for drugs which cause QT prolongation. This thesis investigates the cellular mechanism for QT prolongation, proarrhythmia and sudden death associated with several commonly prescribed non-antiarrhythmic drugs. Specifically, we studied the effects of an antimalarial agent, halofantrine, and five psychoactive agents, thioridazine, chlorpromazine, clozapine, amitriptyline and mianserin on the HERG channel. A better understanding of the way these drugs interact with HERG could facilitate the development of safer drugs.   We used the whole-cell voltage clamp technique to study currents produced by stable transfection of HERG into Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1). Our HERG-transfected cells possessed a potassium channel with biophysical properties similar to HERG-transfected cells previously reported (e.g. Xenopus oocytes, human embryonic kidney cells 293) and also to human IKr. HERG currents were potently inhibited by E-4031, a defining pharmacological signature of IKr. Therefore, these cells provide an appropriate model for the study of this important current in isolation. Halofantrine is a widely used antimalarial agent which has been associated with QT prolongation, TdP and sudden death. Halofantrine blocked HERG tail currents potently with an IC50 of 196.9 nM. Channel inhibition was time-, voltage- and use-dependent. Halofantrine did not alter channel activation or deactivation kinetics but inactivation was accelerated and there was a 20 mV hyperpolarizing shift in the mid-activation potential of steady state inactivation. Block increased with increasing depolarizing pulse duration and was enhanced by pulses that render channels inactivated. This is the first report of HERG channel blockade by halofantrine and is the likely cellular mechanism for its proarrhythmic potential. Our data indicate preferential binding of halofantrine to the open and inactivated channel states. Cardiovascular mortality in psychiatric patients is high. Reports of sudden unexplained death in those taking antipsychotic drugs have raised concerns that part of this excess may be due to drug-induced arrhythmias. We found that thioridazine and chlorpromazine blocked HERG channels (IC50 1.07 ????M and 1.47????M respectively) at clinically relevant concentrations and this is likely the cellular mechanism for their ability to prolong QT interval and induce TdP. To date, HERG block by chlorpromazine has not been reported and the state dependence of channel blockade by these phenothiazines has not been studied. Our results indicate that both drugs preferentially bind to closed HERG channels on the basis that block was not time-, voltage- or use-dependent, did not alter channel activation or deactivation kinetics and was unaffected by the depolarizing pulse duration. Clozapine is the prototype of the newer atypical antipsychotic drugs and is more efficacious and better tolerated than the traditional agents. Serious cardiotoxicity have occurred in clozapine-treated patients including sudden death. We found that clozapine produced a tonic block on HERG channels indicating preferential binding to the closed channel state. The IC50 for block was 2.62 ????M. This is close to the therapeutic concentration of the drug (0.6 to 2 ????M) and concentrations above 10 ????M have been reported during overdoses. Although there have been no specific reports of QT prolongation or TdP in clozapine-treated patients, our data raises the possibility of proarrhythmia as another potential explanation for sudden death during clozapine treatment.  Amitriptyline, a commonly prescribed tricyclic antidepressant, can induce a variety of cardiac rhythm disturbances. Most reports have attributed these effects to its Na+ channel blocking ability. We found that amitriptyline blocked HERG channels with an IC50 of 10 ????M. Such high concentrations can be achieved during overdoses. Thus HERG channel blockade likely underlies amitriptyline????s QT-prolonging effect. Channel inhibition by amitriptyline exhibited positive voltage- and use-dependence and increased progressively with further prolongation of depolarization during an envelope of tails protocol, indicating preferential binding  to an activated (open/inactivated) state of the channel. In contrast to the tricyclics, the tetracyclic antidepressant, mianserin, is much safer and only very rarely associated with cardiac complications. HERG channel blockade by mianserin was the least potent among the 5 psychoactive drugs we studied, with an IC50 of 14.78 ????M, which is 30- to 40-fold higher than therapeutic plasma concentrations of the drug. This probably, in part, accounts for the lack of reports of QT prolongation or TdP with mianserin. Mianserin displayed preferential affinity for an activated state of HERG channels on the basis of voltage-dependent block, a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage of half-maximal activation and an increase in block at low external potassium concentration. Our results show that HERG block is a common feature of many non-cardiac drugs and that this underlies their potential for QT prolongation and TdP. Although the proarrhythmic risk varies according to potency of HERG block (e.g. mianserin is a weak blocker and does not induce TdP), other factors such as drug metabolism, protein binding and myocardial concentrations are also important since the risk of proarrhythmia during clinical use differ significantly even among the more potent HERG blockers.  The preferential binding of these drugs to different channel states together with their diverse chemical structures suggest the presence of multiple distinct binding sites for drugs on HERG channels. There is increasing awareness that many non-antiarrhythmic drugs can prolong the QT interval and provoke TdP. Cardiac safety is now a major issue in new drug development. Our model of HERG K+ channels stably expressed in a mammalian cell line (CHO-K1) provides a useful tool for screening, at the preclinical stage, the proarrhythmic potential of novel drugs intended for human use.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arrhythmia</field><field name="subject">Electrocardiography</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Second language English listening comprehension using different presentations of pictures and video cues</field><field name="creator">Kim, Joong-Won, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The study tested the effects of different presentations using pictures and video cues for improving listening comprehension of English news programs. Four experiments are reported, studying listening comprehension of English as a second/foreign language with 687 Korean secondary students.  Comparisons on listening comprehension showed better performance with visual cues than with no visual cues. Listening comprehension with video cues was more successful than that with pictures. The advantage of the combination of verbal and visual information over the presentation of verbal information alone was in accord with dual coding theory.  When contextual information presented using priming techniques was compared to using feedback and simultaneous presentations, listening comprehension was better using priming. In the comparison of feedback with simultaneous presentations, listening comprehension was improved more when pictures with headlines were presented using feedback than using simultaneous presentations. In contrast, no differences were found between feedback and simultaneous presentations when video cues with headlines were presented. Visual cues with headlines presented using priming might enable learners to activate prior knowledge or schemata to improve listening comprehension. Headlines presented at the beginning stage of listening were effective for listening comprehension. In addition, the effects of presentations were enlarged by adding headlines to visuals. Applying the priming presentation along with the enrichment of contextual cues resulted in improved listening comprehension.  Less proficient students benefited relatively more from the contextual cues with headlines and pictorial cues for comprehending the news than more proficient students. In particular, for less proficient students, video cues with headlines were more helpful in listening comprehension than pictures with headlines. This was because more abundant visual cues such as paralinguistic cues were more likely to be provided in video than in picture formats.  The best listening comprehension occurred when presenting pictorial cues with headlines using priming presentation. The present study concluded that more abundant pictorial cues were useful for improving listening comprehension. Headlines added to the pictorial cues improved performance, especially for less proficient students, who benefited relatively more. The pictorial cues with headlines presented using a 'priming' technique were most effective in improving listening comprehension, probably because they activated prior knowledge or schemata.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching (Secondary)</field><field name="subject">comprehension</field><field name="subject">listening</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19065</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating textual structure in native and non-native English research articles : strategy differences between English and Indonesian writers</field><field name="creator">Mirahayuni, Ni Ketut, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">Research into English research articles (RAs) has largely been focused on articles produced by native English writers. This thesis aims to investigate the textual structure of research articles written by non-native English writers, which may contribute to their acceptance for international publication. A comparison is made between RAs written by native English speakers, Indonesian writers writing in English, and Indonesian writers writing in Indonesian, all in the field of Language and Language Teaching. It explores the relation of text's generic structure, context and linguistic realization. The thesis develops a framework for the generic structure analysis based on Swales' CARS model of moves. A complementary analysis using Systemic-Functional Linguistics' (SFL) approach to texture, namely, text's method of development and structure of information, is conducted to further reveal the textual strategies of the different groups. The findings indicate significant differences in both forms and functions of textual strategies between the native and non-native texts. The differences may partly be due to the influence of writing practices in the non-native writers' first language and partly to the writer's attempt to find an appropriate format in the absence of well-established research writing conventions in the first language. Consequently, non-native English texts may show textual features and organising strategies unfamiliar to both the native English and native Indonesian texts. Findings from the research highlight two issues. First, formal and functional differences of generic structure elements and their realizations between the native and non-native English texts may disadvantage the non-native writers, particularly with regards to employment of unfamiliar organizational strategies. Second, besides knowledge of formal generic structure, more importantly, non-native English writers need to acquire the knowledge of the nature of scientific writing in English in order to achieve full control of the writing process and thus produce successful writing.

Method A non-clinical sample of male teachers and students was recruited from a tertiary education institution to participate in a series of focus groups. Women were recruited from the same context to examine issues common to men. The men's data were analysed using a grounded theory approach to illuminate men's experience of depression. Theoretical sampling of biographical accounts of a small group who had experienced clinical depression (the 'clinical' group) was conducted to explicate the core category. Content analysis was then used to examine the women's data for similarities and contrasts and issues common to men. Standard measures of mood and dispositional optimism (together with sociodemographic and behavioural data) were collected to confirm the non-clinical status of the sample. Results The key results were as follows: (i)	The non-clinical sample of men and women in this study reported all the symptoms of depression classified by the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Version IV). (ii)	In addition, men reported experiencing social withdrawal, and an escalation and intensification of negative emotion that may be triggered by negative thoughts or external events leading to anger and violence towards the self and others. (iii)	The trajectory of emotional distress, conceptualised as the 'big build', links men's experience and expression of depression. (iv)	'Intensified constraint', illuminating the process of the 'big build', helps to explain the 'battle' between individual and social forces that influences hidden depression in men. (v)	'Intensified constraint' may be considered a state (emotional condition) characterising men or a symptom (subjective experience) of depression common to men. (vi)	Non-resolution of problems, exacerbated by social conditioning of men to suppress emotion, leads to delayed help-seeking. (vii)	The women's data were in concordance with the men's data that suggest that men and women experience depression similarly (with reference to DSM-IV criteria). (viii)	The 'big build', as a trajectory of emotional distress and maladaptive strategies to ameliorate depressive symptoms, has salience for women. (ix)	Gender differences in depression may be explained by the expression of depressive symptoms, and the time frame in which the symptoms are managed.  Discussion This study arose out of the commonly held view that women report depressive symptoms at higher rates than men yet men demonstrate higher rates of drug and alcohol abuse and self-harm, referred to as 'depressive equivalents'. This generally accepted disparity of prevalence rates of depression in community samples makes certain assumptions about the mental health of men and women. Women are assumed to have a certain 'pathology' or vulnerability to depression while men are assumed to be either comparatively healthy or 'silent' to their experience. The perception of depression as a 'feminine' problem by men, exacerbated by social conditioning of men (by men and women) to suppress emotional distress and to hide signs of weakness, may influence men's reporting of depressive symptoms and may help to explain the gender disparity. The non-clinical group of men and women in this study has taken us to a point in their descriptions of depression as an objectified or reified 'it' that is something difficult to articulate but which is psychologically painful, to be avoided, numbed or from which to escape. The biographical accounts of a small group of people who have experienced clinical depression (the 'clinical' group) have explicated the meaning of depression even further. Depression, viewed by this articulate small group as 'beyond description', is elucidated by their use of metaphor. The data from the non-clinical group, informed by the 'clinical' group and the literature surrounding depression in men, is synthesised, analysed and interpreted. The findings inform three propositions - the 'big build', 'intensified constraint', and 'averting negative consequences' - that offer new ways of thinking about depression in men. Conclusion The inextricable link between the experience and expression of depression as described by men, confirmed by women and supported by the literature and clinicians' impressions, may explain the existing gap between the 'meaning', 'manifestation' and 'measurement' of depression in men. Questions that tap in to men's trajectory of emotional distress, incorporating a state or symptom of intensified constraint common to men, could narrow the gender differences in reported depressive symptoms. This has implications for the design of measurement instruments and approaches to depressed men in clinical practice.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Depression in men</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19071</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lean manufacturing and its impact on the role of industrial designers in Australia</field><field name="creator">Bohemia, Erik, Industrial Design, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to determine the extent of use, by Australian manufacturers, of lean manufacturing techniques, and the current and future implications for industrial designers. A survey was conducted to gather data on organisation demographics, the role of the industrial designer, production techniques and product development. The survey was distributed to 220 manufacturing organisations undertaking product development in Australia. The number of surveys returned was 134, representing a 60.9 percent response rate. The surveyed organisations represented a broad cross-section of Australian manufacturers by size, location and industry. Manufacturing organisations were categorised into three groups: lean manufacturers, emerging users of lean manufacturing and non-lean manufacturers. It was concluded that lean manufacturing is being adopted by Australian manufacturers and that lean manufacturing is impacting on the role of the industrial design. In general, the data obtained in this research confirms views expressed in the literature that describes current changes in the manufacturing industry. This literature suggests that design will become the next competitive 'weapon', and become a central part of organisational strategy. However, the data also suggests the design profession has still some way to go to adequately grasp its full professional potential, particularly in the area of product development management. The results indicate that industrial designers underperformed in five functional areas that could be considered fundamental to the service normally provided by industrial designers and they have not exceeded expectations in any of the functions included in the survey. It was found that overall, industrial designers were not regarded highly by organisations as a source of new product ideas. Another troubling finding was that industrial designers were generally not perceived as being suitable to manage product development groups. The results of this research could be used to guide educational institutions in regard to curricula for industrial design courses so that future graduates may more effectively fulfil industry requirements.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Costs</field><field name="subject">Industrial</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Production management</field><field name="subject">Industrial designers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19087</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A functional study of neuropeptide Y mediated attenuation of vagal-evoked bradycardia</field><field name="creator">Smith-White, Margaret A., Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the heart, neuropeptide Y (NPY) released during stimulation of the sympathetic nerve attenuates vagal-evoked bradycardia for a prolonged period.  The inhibitory action of NPY is proposed as being Y2 receptor mediated.   In rat and mouse, anaesthetised with sodium pentobarbitone, the selective Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE0246 reduced the inhibition of cardiac vagal activity evoked by a Y2 agonist, N-acetyl [Leu28, 31] NPY 24-36.  BIIE0246 also reduced the inhibitory effect on vagal action evoked by stimulation of the sympathetic nerve.  Deletion of the receptor in Y2 receptor-knockout mice abolished all NPY mediated inhibition of cardiac vagal-evoked bradycardia.  These findings strongly support the proposal that NPY released during stimulation of the sympathetic nerve acts via Y2 receptors on the vagus nerve to decrease the slowing effect on the heart evoked by vagal stimulation.  Examination of the structural components within NPY, using NPY, related PP peptides and structurally altered analogs, showed proline residues in the N-terminal polyproline region of NPY were found to influence the level of presynaptic activity while residues in the PP fold region further enhanced activity.   NPY fragments, as long or longer than 3-36 NPY, possessed full inhibitory activity whereas short C-terminal analogs, such as 24-36 did not.  The two leucine residues in agonist N-acetyl [Leu28, 31] NPY 24-36 was found to alter the structure and enhance the amphipathic nature of the a-helix in the shortened fragment. Arginine residues in the helix were also found to be important for activity.  The leucine residues in N-acetyl [Leu28, 31] NPY 24-36 are proposed to stabilise the molecule producing an over all linear conformation.  Although the conformation adopted by NPY at the receptor is unknown, it is plausible to suggest that the interaction between the proline residues and the a-helix stabilise the molecule in the same way that leucine substitution does in N-acetyl [Leu28, 31] NPY 24-36.  Results obtained in Y2 receptor-knockout mice infer by their faster heart rates, an inhibitory role for the receptor in regions of the brain able to effect sympathetic outflow to the heart.  Therefore knowledge of the structural requirements required of agonists and antagonists for Y2 receptor activation is likely to be of practical significance in drug design for the treatment of diseases affecting both parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation of the heart.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bradycardia</field><field name="subject">Neuropeptide Y</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19090</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pre- and post-failure deformation behaviour of soil slopes</field><field name="creator">Hunter, Gavan James, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the pre and post failure deformation behaviour of landslides in cut, fill and natural soil slopes, and of the deformation behaviour of embankment dams.  The deformation behaviour of landslides and embankment dams have been analysed from a database of case studies from a number of classes of slope (and dam) and material type.  The database included some 450 landslides in cuts, fills and natural slopes, and some 170 embankment dams.  For landslides in soil slopes, methods and guidelines have been developed for use in the analysis, evaluation and prediction of the pre and post failure deformation behaviour.  They take into consideration the factors influencing and the mechanics controlling the deformation behaviour for the classes of slope and material types, which are different for pre and post failure.  Pre-failure deformations are largely controlled by the effective stress conditions within the slope, changes in the boundary conditions and the response of the soil to those changes in boundary conditions.  Whether the soil, under the effective stress conditions imposed within the slope, is contractive (and saturated or near saturated) or dilative on shearing, has a significant influence on the pre failure deformation behaviour. The post failure deformation behaviour is strongly influenced by the mechanics of failure (including whether the soil is contractive or dilative on shearing), the source area slope angle, the downslope geometry, the orientation of the surface of rupture, the material properties and slide volume.  Guidelines are presented for prediction of 'rapid' and 'slow' post failure velocity.  For embankment dams, methods and guidelines have been developed for evaluation and prediction of the deformation behaviour during and post construction for selected embankment types.  They take into consideration the influence of material type and placement methods, material strength and compressibility properties, embankment zoning geometry, embankment height, and reservoir operation, amongst other factors.  Guidelines have been developed to assist in the identification of 'abnormal' deformation behaviour, which can be related to internal deformations or a marginal stability condition and the onset to failure.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Slopes (Soil mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Soil stabilization.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of starvation and nonculturability in the marine pathogen, Vibrio vulnificus</field><field name="creator">McDougald, S. Diane, School of Microbiology &amp; Immunology, UNSW</field><field name="description">Vibrio vulnificus is a model environmental organism exhibiting a classical starvation response during nutrient limitation as well as a non-culturable state when exposed to low temperatures.  In addition to these classic global responses, this organism is an opportunistic pathogen that exhibits numerous virulence factors.  This organism was chosen as the model organism for the identification of regulators of the viable but nonculturable response (VBNC) and the starvation-induced maintenance of culturability (SIMC) that occurs when cells are starved prior to low temperature incubation.  In order to accomplish this, three indirect approaches were used; proteomics, investigation of intercellular signalling pathways and genetic analysis of regulators involved in these responses.  Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to identify proteins expressed under conditions that induced SIMC.  It was determined that carbon and long-term phosphorus starvation were important in the SIMC response.  V. vulnificus was shown to possess genes, luxS and smcR, that are homologues of genes involved in signalling system system 2 in Vibrio harveyi.  Signal molecules were produced upon starvation and the entry to stationary phase in V. vulnificus.    Furthermore, a null mutation in smcR, a transcriptional regulator was shown to have pleiotropic effects in V. vulnificus, including up-regulation of numerous virulence factors and a defect in starvation survival and development of the SIMC response.  We propose that V. vulnificus possesses a signalling system analogous to that of system 2 in V. harveyi, and that this system is involved in the regulation of stationary phase and starvation adaptation in this organism.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Starvation</field><field name="subject">nonculturability</field><field name="subject">VBNC</field><field name="subject">quorum sensing</field><field name="subject">signalling</field><field name="subject">AI-2</field><field name="subject">Vibrio. luxR</field><field name="subject">Vibrio vulnificus</field><field name="subject">starvation</field><field name="subject">cold adaptation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resolving conflict in hypnosis</field><field name="creator">Mallard, David, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the management of conflict between reality and suggestion during hypnosis. The eight experiments conducted for this thesis investigated the social, motivational, and cognitive factors that mediate participants? response to conflict during a negative visual hallucination. Chapter 1 reviews the relevant literature and presents the rationale for the program of research. Chapter 2 presents Experiments 1 and 2, which explored hypnotic participants? capacity to manage conflict under different conditions. The findings indicated that cognitive and behavioural strategies that allow participants to avoid conflict are useful, but not essential, in managing hypnotic conflict. Chapter 3 presents Experiment 3, which developed a paradigm that allowed conflict to be manipulated in a way that minimised response cues. The findings indicated that gradually and unobtrusively modifying a stimulus influenced participants? responses even though participants did not indicate any knowledge that the stimulus was manipulated. Chapter 4 presents Experiment 4, which investigated the relevance of hypnotisability and hypnosis to conflict management. The findings indicated that hypnosis provides a context in which hypnotisable participants are able to maintain their belief despite demanding levels of conflict. Chapter 5 presents Experiments 5 and 6, which focused on the role of social demands in participants? response to hypnotic conflict. The findings indicated that demand characteristics shape participants? interpretation of the appropriate response to conflict during an hypnotic suggestion. Chapter 6 presents Experiments 7 and 8, which addressed the relevance of cognitive processes to hypnotic conflict management. The findings indicated that participants used cognitive strategies to manage conflict that were appropriate to the suggestion, degree of conflict, and their individual abilities. Overall, the findings indicated that hypnotic participants? management of conflict involves motivated, strategic responding so as to maintain a belief that events are as communicated by the hypnotist. These issues are discussed within a theoretical perspective that is presented in Chapter 7. This perspective emphasises the hypnotisability of participants, the role of hypnotic induction, participants? interpretation of the desired response, the belief that participants develop in the reality of the suggested events, and the readiness of participants to employ conflict management strategies that produce the appropriate outcome.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hypnosis</field><field name="subject">conflict</field><field name="subject">hallucination</field><field name="subject">cognitive strategies</field><field name="subject">demand characteristics</field><field name="subject">motivation</field><field name="subject">hypnotism</field><field name="subject">conflict management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constitution and maintenance of feminist practice : comparative case study of sexual assault centres in Australia and Korea</field><field name="creator">Jung, Kyungja, School of Social Science &amp; Policy &amp; the Women's Studies Program, UNSW</field><field name="description">Although some research has focused on feminist practice in general, the external and internal dynamics of feminist practice still remains theoretically and empirically under-researched. This study addresses this void in feminist research and places a special focus on the relationship of feminist organisations with the state and within the broader context of the women's movement.  This thesis explores the constitution and maintenance of  feminist practices in one specific context in South Korea and Australia. Drawing on empirical and historical data derived from the case studies, two questions are explored in this study: What constitutes feminist practices in a feminist organisation? How can feminist practices be sustained?. Two feminist-run Sexual Assault Centres (SACs), one in Korea, one in Australia are studied and analysed, involving 32, in-depth interviews with activists of the two centres, non-participant and participant observation, and document analysis. First, this thesis provides a detailed account of feminist practice and organisational dynamics among feminist organisations, the feminist movement and the state. This thesis confirms that the practices of feminist organisations are seen as dynamic processes constituted by the context in which they are situated, the role of feminist activists and the nature and strength of the broader women's movement. This study, in particular, demonstrates that the relationship of the organisation with the state is a strong determinant in constructing feminist practices. Second, this thesis examines organisational practices at different phases such as the establishment, development and crisis phases. As both centres were experiencing crises, the study illuminates that the crisis in each centre has provided an opportunity for re-examination and reflection on their practices in  shifting internal and external contexts. This study also suggests that continuous reflexive attention is necessary to maintain feminist practices. Moreover, the study demonstrates that the role of the activists in constructing and maintaining feminist practices is critical, in particular, in small organisations such as the ASAC and KSAC.  This research, the first major study on feminist practices in Korea and Australia, makes a significant contribution to the study of feminist organisations, the state and, in general, feminist theory.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Feminism</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Korea (South)</field><field name="subject">Sex crimes</field><field name="subject">Investigation</field><field name="subject">Rape victims</field><field name="subject">Counseling of</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silent values : contextualising justice within the disjunctures between care discourses, regulatory requirements and nursing practice realities.</field><field name="creator">Duke, Janet, School of Social Work, UNSW</field><field name="description">The notion of 'Care' has occupied a central place as foundation in nursing theory, ethics and practice.  An examination of critical and authoritative documents reveals that the term is vague and ill defined.  The literature on care does not theorise the concept as fully as expected in a profession where the concept is considered central. Moreover, even the best theories of care neglect justice. Applying Wittgenstein's concept of family resemblance allows the debate to move on from definitional issues to assess the applicability of 'care' to the practice of the profession.  An examination of a range of assessments of nursing practice shows that although 'care' is frequently used in connection with nursing, it does not appear to be a major consideration in key areas of appraisal.  This thesis explores the relationship between care and justice in nursing and proposes that they be integrated within nursing theory. A theory for nursing that does not exclude care, but that has justice as its basis is proposed.  Care, when used in the context of justice provides nursing with a theory that is appropriate not only for nursing theory and ethics but also assists the profession meet the demands of modern practice.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Nursing ethics</field><field name="subject">Nurse and patient</field><field name="subject">Caring</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flexible Bayesian modelling of gamma ray count data</field><field name="creator">Leonte, Daniela, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">Bayesian approaches to prediction and the assessment of predictive uncertainty in generalized linear models are often based on averaging predictions over different models, and this requires methods for accounting for model uncertainty. In this thesis we describe computational methods for Bayesian inference and model selection for generalized linear models, which improve on existing techniques.  These methods are applied to the building of flexible models for gamma ray count data (data measuring the natural radioactivity of rocks) at the Castlereagh Waste Management Centre, which served as a hazardous waste disposal facility for the Sydney region between March 1978 and August 1998. Bayesian model selection methods for generalized linear models enable us to approach problems of smoothing, change point detection and spatial prediction for these data within a common methodological and computational framework, by considering appropriate basis expansions of a mean function.  The data at Castlereagh were collected in the following way.  A number of boreholes were drilled at the site, and for each borehole a gamma ray detector recorded gamma ray emissions at different depths as the detector was raised gradually from the bottom of the borehole to ground level.  The profile of intensity of gamma counts can be informative about the geology at each location, and estimation of intensity profiles raises problems of smoothing and change point detection for count data.  The gamma count profiles can also be modelled spatially, to inform the geological profile across the site.  Understanding the geological structure of the site is important for modelling the transport of chemical contaminants beneath the waste disposal area.  The structure of the thesis is as follows. Chapter 1 describes the Castlereagh hazardous waste site and the geophysical data, which motivated the methodology developed in this research. We summarise the principles of Gamma Ray (GR) logging, a method routinely employed by geophysicists and environmental engineers in the detailed evaluation of hazardous site geology, and detail the use of the Castlereagh data in this research.  In Chapter 2 we review some fundamental ideas of Bayesian inference and computation and discuss them in the context of generalised linear models.  Chapter 3 details the theoretical basis of our work. Here we give a new Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme for Bayesian variable selection in generalized linear models, which is analogous to the well-known Swendsen-Wang algorithm for the Ising model. Special cases of this sampling scheme are used throughout the rest of the thesis.  In Chapter 4 we discuss the use of methods for Bayesian model selection in generalized linear models in two specific applications, which we implement on the Castlereagh data.  First, we consider smoothing problems where we flexibly estimate the dependence of a response variable on one or more predictors, and we apply these ideas to locally adaptive smoothing of gamma ray count data.  Second, we discuss how the problem of multiple change point detection can be cast as one of model selection in a generalized linear model, and consider application to change point detection for gamma ray count data.  In Chapter 5 we consider spatial models based on partitioning a spatial region of interest into cells via a Voronoi tessellation, where the number of cells and the positions of their centres is unknown, and show how these models can be formulated in the framework of established methods for Bayesian model selection in generalized linear models. We implement the spatial partition modelling approach to the spatial analysis of gamma ray data, showing how the posterior distribution of the number of cells, cell centres and cell means provides us with an estimate of the mean response function describing spatial variability across the site.  Chapter 6 presents some conclusions and suggests directions for future research. A paper based on the work of Chapter 3 has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, and a paper based on the work in Chapter 4 has been accepted for publication in Mathematical Geology.  A paper based on the spatial modelling of Chapter 5 is in preparation and will be submitted for publication shortly. The work in this thesis was collaborative, to a smaller or larger extent in its various components.  I authored Chapters 1 and 2 entirely, including definition of the problem in the context of the CWMC site, data gathering and preparation for analysis, review of the literature on computational methods for Bayesian inference and model selection for generalized linear models.  I also authored Chapters 4 and 5 and benefited from some of Dr Nott's assistance in developing the algorithms. In Chapter 3, Dr Nott led the development of sampling scheme B (corresponding to having non-zero interaction parameters in our Swendsen-Wang type algorithm).  I developed the algorithm for sampling scheme A (corresponding to setting all algorithm interaction parameters to zero in our Swendsen-Wang type algorithm), and performed the comparison of the performance of the two sampling schemes. The final discussion in Chapter 6 and the direction for further research in the case study context is also my work.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bayesian statistical decision theory</field><field name="subject">gamma rays</field><field name="subject">Castlereagh Waste Management Centre (Sydney</field><field name="subject">N.S.W.)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19147</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stress corrosion cracking of copper-base alloys</field><field name="creator">Hall, Ian Dorsett, School of Metallurgy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the stress corrosion cracking of a series of aluminium bronze alloys and attempts to characterize the cracking in relation to the various mechanisms proposed.  The theories of cracking applicable to the aluminium bronze/ammonia system include; the anodic dissolution, the film rupture and the embrittlement theories, which are described in the literature review. The copper aluminium alloy system was selected for investigation as it exhibits a martensite transformation, making the cracking of these alloys in ammonia solutions a usefulful comparison with the cracking of stainless steels in chloride solutions.  The study used 'U-bend' specimens stressed in ammonia solution preconcentrated with copper, while the oxidation of the alloys under the same conditions was examined using unstressed specimens.  Oxidation in this thesis is taken to mean an anodic dissolution process with or without the formation of a metallic oxide layer. The tests showed three binary alloys to be susceptible to intergranular and transgranular cracking, while two commercial alloys only cracked transgranularly and only in pH = 11 ammonia solution.  Stress corrosion conditions gave rise to sharp, narrow cracks traversing all the phases in the alloy with matching features on opposing fracture surfaces, whereas oxidation gave rise to less distinct, more rounded features with a definite phase dependence.  Further experiments showed the limited penetration and reactivity of a corrosive solution along narrow cracks. It is concluded that stress corrosion cracking and oxidation occur by different mechanisms and that the mechanism of stress corrosion cracking is unlikely to involve oxidation as a necessary step to cracking.  The results of the present study support an embrittlement mechanism of stress corrosion cracking in aluminium bronze alloys.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Copper alloys</field><field name="subject">Corrosion</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19160</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mesoscopic quantum ratchets and the thermodynamics of energy selective electron heat engines</field><field name="creator">Humphrey, Tammy Ellen, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A ratchet is an asymmetric, non-equilibrated system that can produce a directed current of particles without the need for macroscopic potential gradients. In rocked quantum electron ratchets, tunnelling and wave-reflection can induce reversals in the direction of the net current as a function of system parameters. An asymmetric quantum point contact in a GaAs/GaAlAs heterostructure has been studied experimentally as a realisation of a quantum electron ratchet. A Landauer model predicts reversals in the direction of the net current as a function of temperature, amplitude of the rocking voltage, and Fermi energy. Artifacts such as circuit-induced asymmetry, also known as self-gating, were carefully removed from the experimental data, which showed net current and net differential conductance reversals, as predicted by the model. The model also predicts the existence of a heat current where the net electron current changes sign, as equal numbers of high and low energy electrons are pumped in opposite directions. An idealised quantum electron ratchet is studied analytically as an energy selective electron heat engine and refrigerator. The hypothetical device considered consists of two electron reservoirs with different temperatures and Fermi energies. The reservoirs are linked via a resonant state in a quantum dot, which functions as an idealised energy filter for electrons. The efficiency of the device approaches the Carnot value when the energy transmitted by the filter is tuned to that where the Fermi distributions in the reservoirs are equal. The maximum power regime, where the filter transmits all electrons that contribute positively to the power, is also examined. Analytic expressions are obtained for the power and efficiency of the idealised device as both a heat engine and as a refrigerator in this regime of operation. The expressions depend on the ratio of the voltage to the difference in temperature of the reservoirs, and on the ratio of the reservoir temperatures. The energy selective electron heat engine is shown to be non-endoreversible, and to operate in an analogous manner to the three-level amplifier, a laser based quantum heat engine. Implications for improving the efficiency of thermionic refrigerators and power generators are discussed.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum ratchet</field><field name="subject">electron heat engine</field><field name="subject">finite-time thermodynamics</field><field name="subject">maximum power</field><field name="subject">reversibility</field><field name="subject">Carnot efficiency</field><field name="subject">thermionics</field><field name="subject">energy selective</field><field name="subject">quantum dot</field><field name="subject">thermodynamics</field><field name="subject">quantum theory</field><field name="subject">heat-engines</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19186</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Looking after yourself : the cultural politics of health magazine reader letters</field><field name="creator">Newman, Christy Elizabeth, National Centre in HIV Social Research &amp; School of Media &amp; Communications, UNSW</field><field name="description">Health is an organising principle of contemporary neoliberal citizenship, particularly evident in the political rhetoric of individual responsibility articulated around the privatisation of public health and welfare systems. The popular culture of these political technologies is expressed via the discourses of self-help and self-care, exemplified by the commercial success of consumer health magazines, and the responsibilising strategies of public health interventions. This thesis investigates the contemporary function of health magazines by examining both the content and the context of reader letters published between 1997 and 2000 in six Sydney-based 'commercial' and 'community' publications, and incorporating interviews with magazine editors. The three commercial magazines address the health media 'publics' of women (Good Medicine), men (Men's Health) and alternative health consumers (Nature &amp; Health), whereas the three community publications address the 'counterpublics' of people living with HIV/AIDS (Talkabout), sex workers (The Professional) and illicit drug users (User's News). Despite their different social contexts, these six magazines are all exemplary of the advanced liberal health imperatives of Australian popular culture, although the community magazines also empower audiences to facilitate social change. Reader letters are approached via the interpretive lens of cultural studies, in which the specific local characteristics of each text is seen to have wider global implications. Each magazine's letters are positioned within a complex cultural, political and economic context that includes the rise of consumer culture, the social function of narrative disclosures, the increased validation of exhibitionism and the gendered politics of health and medicine. This research advocates for interdisciplinary dialogue between media/cultural studies, health/medical sociology and political theory, suggesting that health magazine reader letters can help to identify the role of popular and alternative media in constructing ideals of 'citizenships' within advanced liberalism.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health magazines</field><field name="subject">neoliberalism</field><field name="subject">media audiences</field><field name="subject">cultural studies</field><field name="subject">sociology of health</field><field name="subject">reader letters</field><field name="subject">health periodicals</field><field name="subject">liberalism</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">mass media</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">political aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19192</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of a rotor system with ball bearing induced non-linearities; and the development of transfer matrix techniques suitable for analysing such systems</field><field name="creator">Liew, Andrew, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with enhancing analysis tools for evaluating the non-linear dynamics of rotor bearing systems and in particular those where non-linearity is likely to result in aperiodic or chaotic behaviour, such as rolling element bearing systems. The tool to be enhanced was the transfer matrix approach which has been extensively used in the past for analysing linear rotor bearing systems. However, its use for evaluating non-linear behaviour has been virtually non-existent. Hence, the major aim of the thesis is to extend transfer matrix capabilities to handle non-linear systems. To this end a harmonic balance transfer matrix technique capable of analysing non-linear systems with multiple pedestal supported bearings was first developed. However, this approach is restricted to periodic response. To enable the analysis of non-linear systems with non-periodic response and provide a stability check for the harmonic balance technique, a transient transfer matrix has also been developed. The softwares for both of these newly developed transfer matrix techniques have been successfully verified for various non-linear rotor bearing systems using an established system matrix based transient rotordynamics software as the yardstick. These developments have been published in refereed journals. To investigate systems with rolling element bearings, appropriate bearing modelling which incorporates angular contact and rolling element inertia needed to be developed and incorporated into transient analysis softwares. Theoretical results from this were compared to data obtained from an experimental test rig which was designed to represent the salient features of an F/A-18 aircraft mounted accessory drive. The rig allowed for variation of bearing preload, unbalance loading and bearing support stiffness and could be run up to 17,000rpm. Full details of the design and commissioning are presented. Results showed better agreement than linear analyses but significant differences were encountered. Errors were largely due to estimated bearing parameters, in particular bearing damping, which was found to be a sensitive variable, so that agreement between theory and experiment was mainly qualitative. Other sources of error were those associated with experimental measurement and limitations of the bearing modelling. Further improvement of the bearing model is needed if better quantitative agreement is to be obtained between the predictions and experiment.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rotors -- Dynamics</field><field name="subject">Matrix mechanics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation and comparison of the decision-making process used by industry specialist and other auditors</field><field name="creator">Moroney, Robyn Ann, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Large accounting firms have been structuring their audit divisions along industry lines for some years. Industry specialisation is seen as a means of differentiation between otherwise similar accounting firms. At the individual level industry specialists are identified as being so designated within their firm. They spend a substantial amount of their time auditing clients in that industry. The purpose of this study is to determine what industry specialist auditors do that is different and similar when working on industry-based tasks, one of which they specialise in. Behavioural decision theory is used to investigate the differences and similarities in the decision-making processes of industry specialist and other auditors. It is known that industry specialists perform better on tasks set in their industry. The purpose of this study is to learn why. To that end, the pre-information search, information search and decision processing phases of the decision-making process are examined. It is expected that industry specialists are more efficient and effective at each stage of the decision-making process when completing a case set in the industry they specialise in. Two controlled experiments were conducted in the offices of each of the Big 4 international accounting firms. Participants included manufacturing and superannuation industry specialists from each firm. Each participant was invited to take part in both experiments, which were conducted consecutively via the internet. The first experiment comprised two cases, one set in each industry setting (manufacturing and superannuation). Participants completed both cases. The purpose of the first experiment was to conduct a within-subject examination unveiling similarities and differences between industry specialists and other auditors during the pre-information search, information search and decision processing phases of the decision-making process. Their performance on each case was also monitored and measured. Significant results were found for information search and performance. Moderate results were found for one proxy each of the pre-information search and the decision processing phases. The relationship between efficiency at each stage of the decision-making process and performance was also measured. A significant relationship was found for the pre-information search and decision processing phases.  The second experiment comprised two strategic business risk tasks set in each industry setting (manufacturing and superannuation). Participants completed both sets of tasks. The purpose of the second experiment was to examine effectiveness during the pre-information search (listing key strategic business risks), information search (listing key inputs) and decision processing (listing key processes) phases of the decision-making process and their ability to identify and list key outputs (accounts and assertions) for an identified risk (technological change for the manufacturing industry task and solvency due to insufficient funding for the superannuation industry task) within each industry setting. The results were very significant overall. Industry specialist auditors were able list more key strategic business risks, inputs, processes and outputs when the task was set in the industry in which they specialise. The relationship between effectiveness at each stage of the decision-making process and performance was also measured. A significant relationship was found between effectiveness in listing key inputs and effectiveness in listing key outputs (accounts).</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Behavioural Decision Theory</field><field name="subject">Industry specialisation</field><field name="subject">Expertise paradigm</field><field name="subject">Auditing</field><field name="subject">Auditors' reports -- Standards</field><field name="subject">Auditing -- Evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of complexity upon unintentional noncompliance for Australian personal income taxpayers</field><field name="creator">McKerchar, Margaret Anne, Australian Taxation Studies Program, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study explores the impact of complexity upon unintentional non-compliance behaviour for personal taxpayers in Australia. This area of research did not appear to have been previously studied in an Australian context and in this respect, the study represents an original contribution. While studies have been conducted both in Australia and overseas, they have generally been directed at other types of compliance behaviour and tend to be inconclusive in their findings.  According to the compliance literature, there appeared to be little consensus of opinion on the factors that determined behaviour and appropriate research methods. It emerged that more narrowly-defined studies with stronger research methods offered potential for furthering knowledge in this field. Thus the study focused on one behavioural outcome and one type of taxpayer, using a multi-paradigm research method.  Unintentional non-compliance, as an outcome, was selected as it appeared to hold promise for improvements in overall compliance to be readily made, provided its causes were understood. Complexity was considered to be the most likely cause of unintentional non-compliance, and those who prepared their own income tax return, the group likely to be most affected.  The study used both a quantitative and qualitative component from which a number of convergent results emerged. These included that the major cause of complexity was the ambiguity of tax laws and the volume of explanatory material required. Further, personal taxpayers were committed to compliance even though they regarded the system as less than fair. Together, complexity and commitment to compliance caused taxpayers to experience unnecessary compliance costs. Where taxpayers completed their own return, complexity resulted in a high level of errors that generally resulted in an overstatement of tax liability. In addition, some taxpayers chose to be over-compliant as a means of dealing with complexity and commitment.  It was concluded that complexity compromised the integrity of the Australian income tax system by imposing an unfair burden on personal taxpayers in respect of both tax paid and compliance costs incurred. However, there appeared to be little, if any, financial incentive for the tax authority to address the causes of complexity for personal taxpayers.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Taxpayer compliance -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Income tax -- Law and legislation -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Tax returns -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Tax administration and procedure -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the management of childhood asthma</field><field name="creator">Khan, Md. Sanaur Rahman, School of Women?s &amp; Children?s Health, UNSW</field><field name="description">Objectives: To improve the management of childhood asthma. Subjects &amp; Setting: Children admitted with asthma from 1st January 2000 to 31st December 2000; and children discharged with asthma from Emergency Department (ED) of Sydney Children?s Hospital (SCH) between 16th October 2000 and 28th February 2002. Methods: There were two major studies addressing aspects of asthma management, namely the retrospective in-patient study and the prospective ED presentation study. Each of these was subdivided in two different studies to address different research questions. In the first retrospective study, a priori criteria for theoretical &amp;quottime ready for discharge&amp;quot (TRD) for asthmatic admissions were defined based on frequency of use of salbutamol. In the second retrospective study, we followed 361 children for 1 year from the date of their discharge, to find out whether those who received asthma education, written asthma action plan, and preventer medications at the time of discharge and whose follow?up was arranged prior to discharge, represented to the ED or were readmitted. The prospective study, which also addressed two different research questions, was a randomised-controlled trial in which parents of 310 children who had been discharged from ED with asthma, received written asthma materials only or received telephone consultation in addition to written materials. Background severity and control of asthma were assessed in baseline study from parent?s reported symptom frequency and medication uses. Outcome measures: readmission and representation to the ED, regular use of preventer medications, possession and use of written asthma action plan, and asthma symptom measures. Results: (1) 116 (27.7%) children were discharged before our theoretical TRD and only 2 child who were discharged after achieving TRD, developed symptoms which required oxygenation and more frequent doses of salbutamol. Both readmission and representation to ED within one week of discharge were uncommon. (2) 121 children represented within 1 year of their discharge, of whom 68 children were readmitted. Both receiving asthma education during admission and arranging follow-up prior to discharge were associated with a decreased likelihood of representation as well as readmission (P &amp;gt 0.001). (3) In RCT, the baseline study showed that 14% of children were not receiving appropriate preventer therapy despite indications; and a further 34% had frequent symptoms despite receiving preventer therapy. 62% of the parents reported of having written asthma action plan but less than 50% of them reported using it regularly. At follow up we observed both possession and use of written asthma action plan (p = 0.002) as well as regular use of preventer medications (p = 0.001) were improved in the intervention group compared with the control group. Conclusions: Discharge on 3-hourly rather than 4-hourly doses of salbutamol appears safe and shortens length of stay by an average of 5.5 hrs. Both asthma education and follow-up at the time discharge appear to reduce readmission and representation to ED. Telephone consultation can increase the regular use of preventer medications and written asthma action plan.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asthma in children -- Treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics of industrial development in border towns : case studies of Thailand</field><field name="creator">Maneepong, Chuthatip, School of the Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the dynamics of industrial development in the areas where Thailand borders with neighbouring countries.  It argues that the locational advantages approach 'one that focuses on social and economic connections in border towns, government investments, policy measures and the role of export-oriented multinational companies' is not necessarily an appropriate approach.  An investigation is conducted to find out to what extent the locational advantages approach applies to Thai border towns.  An assessment of the government role in promoting and managing industrial development has also been undertaken to identify the success of this industrial decentralisation scheme.  Other factors that contribute to industrial development are also examined.	The thesis uses a comparative case study approach, comparing sponsored and non-sponsored towns, and presents four case studies of border towns in Thailand, bordering Myanmar and Laos.  This research method provides a better assessment than an internal assessment of government programmes would.  The results show that the dynamics of industrial development in Thai border towns is better explained by the production network approach emphasising the embeddedness of small and medium sized local manufacturing industries.  The entrepreneurship and social networks of entrepreneurs promote the emergence and growth of industrial development.  Horizontal industrial relationships promote flexible operations and compensate for limited access and resources in border towns.  In addition, a border location does not by itself stimulate economic link with the neighbouring country because negative perception and regulatory barriers to the crossing of borders hinder mutual cooperation.  Due to the discrepancy between government assumptions programmes and the dynamics of industrial development, the survey shows that the impacts of government investments on industrial development are marginal.  The thesis concludes that the applicability of the locational advantages approach for industrial development in Thai border towns is limited and that the policy of the government and international agencies should be diverse and should consider other approaches such as a production network approach.  Similarly, government programmes should accommodate the needs of small and medium sized manufacturing industries.  The role of local government and the private sectors in minimising barriers to the crossing of borders should also be considered.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">City planning -- Thailand</field><field name="subject">Cities and towns -- Thailand -- Growth</field><field name="subject">Thailand -- Industries</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital processing of shallow seismic refraction data with the convolution section</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Derecke, School of Geology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The refraction convolution section (RCS) is a simple and efficient method for full trace processing of shallow seismic refraction data. It facilitates improved interpretation of shallow seismic refraction data through the convenient use of amplitudes as well as traveltimes. The RCS is generated by the convolution of forward and reverse shot records. The convolution operation effectively adds the first arrival traveltimes of each pair of forward and reverse traces and produces a measure of the depth to the refracting interface in units of time which is equivalent to the time-depth function of the generalized reciprocal method (GRM). The convolution operation also multiplies the amplitudes of first arrival signals. This operation compensates for the large effects of geometric spreading to a very good first approximation, with the result that the convolved amplitude is essentially proportional to the square of the head coefficient. The head coefficient is approximately proportional to the ratio of the specific acoustic impedances in the upper layer and in the refractor, where there is a reasonable contrast between the specific acoustic impedances in the layers. The RCS can also include a separation between each pair of forward and reverse traces in order to accommodate the offset distance in a manner similar to the XY spacing of the GRM. Lateral variations in the near-surface soil layers can effect amplitudes thereby causing 'amplitude statics'. Increases in the thickness of the surface soil layer correlate with increases in refraction amplitudes. These increases are adequately described and corrected with the transmission coefficients of the Zoeppritz equations. The minimum amplitudes, rather than an average, should be used where it is not possible to map the near surface layers. The use of amplitudes with 3D data effectively improves the spatial resolution by almost an order of magnitude. Amplitudes provide a measure of refractor wavespeeds at each detector, whereas the analysis of traveltimes provides a measure over several detectors, commonly a minimum of six. The ratio of amplitudes obtained with different shot azimuths provides a detailed qualitative measure of azimuthal anisotropy. Dip filtering of the RCS removes 'cross-convolution' artifacts and provides a convenient approach to the study of later events. The RCS facilitates the stacking of refraction data in a manner similar to the CMP methods of reflection seismology. It can improve signal-to-noise ratios.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Seismic refraction method</field><field name="subject">Signal processing -- Digital techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Democracy, consultation and socio-environmental degradation : diagnostic insights from the Western Sydney/Hawkesbury-Nepean region</field><field name="creator">Darbas, Toni, School of Science &amp; Technology Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of community consultation to address socio-environmental degradation is entwined with contested democratic principles polarising views of its role. I frame this problem by examining three democratic paradigms faced with two contemporary problems. The deliberative argument that preferences require enrichment with debate mediates between the liberal-aggregative view that preferences are individual, private and amenable to aggregation and the view that participation in public life is foundational. Viewing consultation as deliberative reconciles the liberal-aggregative view of consultation as the illegitimate elevation of unrepresentative minority groups with the participationist view that consultation constitutes a step towards participatory democracy. Theorists of social reflexivity, however, point to an elided politics of knowledge challenging technoscience's exemption from politically garnered consent. Also neglected by much democratic theory is how functional differentiation renders self-referential legal, political, technoscientific and administrative domains increasingly unaccountable. I employ Habermas' procedural theory that public spheres allow social irritations into the political domain where they can be encoded into laws capable of systemic interjection in response, along with a dialogic extension accommodating the politics of knowledge. I then use this procedural-dialogic deliberative understanding of democracy to elucidate the context and outcomes of the NSW State's consultative strategy. The NSW state, institutionally compelled to underwrite economic growth, implicating itself in that growth's socio-environmental side effects provoking widespread contestation. The resulting Environmental Planning and Assessment Act (1979) and its adjunctive consultative provisions helped highlight the socio-environmental degradation of the Hawkesbury Nepean River Catchment via Western Sydney's urban sprawl, politicising the region. The convenement of a consultative forum to oversee a contaminated site audit within the region facilitated incisive lay critique of the technoscientific underpinnings of administrative underwriting of socio-environmental degradation. The discomforted NSW State tightened environmental policy, gutted the EP&amp;A Act's consultative provisions and removed regional dialogic forums and institutions. I conclude that the socio-economic accord equating economic growth with social progress is both entrenched and besieged, destabilising the political/administrative/technoscientific regime built upon it. This withdrawal of avenues for critique risks deeper estrangement between reflexive society and the NSW State generative of electoral volatility.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental policy -- New South Wales -- Western Sydney</field><field name="subject">Community development -- New South Wales -- Western Sydney</field><field name="subject">Environmental protection -- New South Wales -- Hawkesbury River Region -- Citizen participation</field><field name="subject">Environmental protection -- New South Wales -- Nepean River Watershed -- Citizen participation</field><field name="subject">Western Sydney (N.S.W.) -- Social conditions</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The autothermal reforming of artificial gasoline</field><field name="creator">Praharso, Praharso, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Stringent legislation on control of vehicle exhaust emissions has led to consideration of alternative means of reducing emissions, with hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles being accepted as one favoured possibility. However, the difficulties of storing and distributing hydrogen as a fuel are such that the conversion of more readily available fuels to hydrogen on board the vehicle may be required. The production of hydrogen by the partial oxidation of isooctane over Rh/Al2O3, Rh/CeO2-?l2O3 and Rh/CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts has been investigated. Oxidation was initiated at temperatures between 200 ?220 oC. The yield of hydrogen was 100%. CeO2-ZrO2 was found to be the best support. The production of hydrogen by the autothermal reforming of artificial gasoline has been studied. Part of gasoline is oxidised to produce heat and steam to promote the steam reforming of unburnt gasoline to produce hydrogen. The use of platinum impregnated on ceria supports (active for oxidation) and a commercial nickel based catalyst (Ni-com), for steam reforming of gasoline have been explored. Initiation of oxidation of artificial gasoline over unreduced platinum based catalysts occurred at temperature as low as 150 oC, depending on the oxygen:carbon ratio and the liquid hydrocarbon used. Detailed kinetic studies of the steam reforming of isooctane and artificial gasoline (a mix of cyclohexane, isooctane and octane) over pre-reduced Ni-com catalysts showed that the reaction was 0.17 order in isooctane and 0.54 order in steam, whilst the reaction was 0.08 order in artificial gasoline and 0.23 order in steam. Mechanisms have been proposed to account for the dual site surface reaction with dissociative adsorption of isooctane or artificial gasoline and steam. Combined oxidation and steam reforming systems (autothermal reforming) using Pt/CeO2 as a front catalyst bed and Ni-com as the rear bed at the feed conditions of oxygen:carbon (O:C) ratio of ca.1.2 and steam:carbon (S:C) ratio of ca.2, produces ca. 3.5 moles of hydrogen per mole of gasoline fed. The system reaction temperature could be controlled by adjusting the O:C and S:C ratios in feed.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gasoline</field><field name="subject">Catalytic reforming</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The rise and dilution of buoyant jets and their behaviour in an internal wave field</field><field name="creator">Tate, Peter  Michael, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">A new buoyant jet model is presented in this thesis to simulate the trajectory and dilution of a fluid from a single port or line source.  The new features include: A generalised derivation of the governing equations so that buoyant jets discharged from a source of any shape can be modelled within the one framework, and the effects of high-frequency internal waves on the motion of the buoyant jet.  	Past buoyant jet models were constructed for specific cases and their application is necessarily restricted.  In this thesis, a new model is developed in a Lagrangian framework that can be applied to buoyant jet discharges at any angle into ambient waters that may be stratified or unstratified, flowing or stagnant.  The model is validated using both laboratory and field data.  Furthermore, the model is applicable to the continuous discharge of a buoyant jet from line, axisymmetric or elliptic sources and to the instantaneous discharge of a spherical puff.  No previously published model is capable of unifying and solving all of these problems within the one framework.  	Transforming the governing equations to their non-dimensional form shows that the trajectory and dilution of discharges from line or axisymmetric sources or of spherical puffs into a flowing, stratified ambient environment are uniquely specified using three parameters.  These are: the non-dimensional size of the outlet port, the relative importance of the initial fluxes of momentum and buoyancy, and the number of orthogonal planes through which entrainment can occur.  This is a significant advance in the understanding of the processes affecting buoyant jets.	When high-frequency internal waves are present in the receiving waters they can have significant effects on the buoyant jet.  These effects are incorporated into the present model.  Using data obtained from an experiment conducted off Sydney the effects of internal waves on the height of rise and dilution of the buoyant jet were found to exceed a factor of two.  Consequently, it is important that the effects of internal waves (when present) be incorporated into any buoyant jet model.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jets</field><field name="subject">Fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">Buoyant ascent (Hydrodynamics)</field><field name="subject">Internal waves</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of microarray technology to study the physiology and pathogenesis of mouse colonising strains of Helicobacter pylori</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Lucinda Jenny, School of Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Microbiology &amp; Immunology, UNSW</field><field name="description">Helicobacter pylori is a unique bacterial pathogen which colonises the human stomach. Infection with H. pylori has been linked to several disease outcomes including gastric and duodenal ulcer, gastric cancer and MALT lymphoma. Considering the harsh environment in which it resides and the lack of competition from other bacteria, this host/pathogen relationship is particularly interesting. Microarray analysis is a new and powerful technique which can be used to investigate various aspects of these complex interactions. Expression profiling of bacteria using microarrays remains in its infancy and thus appropriate methods were developed herein for investigating the transcriptional responses of H. pylori to various environments in vitro. Studies showed the tight relationship between growth phase dependent expression of iron homeostasis, motility and virulence genes in H. pylori for the first time. Consequently, the late exponential phase of growth was implicated as the most virulent growth phase of this bacterium in vitro. In response to mammalian cell co-culture, induced expression of H. pylori metabolism/respiration genes, genes of unknown function and genes encoding the 2-component regulators, HP1021 and HP0166, were detected. These represent a set of genes likely to be important specifically in the context of infection. To investigate the host response to infection a new mouse colonising strain of H. pylori, the Sydney Strain 2000 (SS2000), was isolated for use in comparative studies with the established strain, Sydney Strain 1 (SS1). Both host and strain specific effects were studied in a 15 month colonisation experiment using C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. Genomic typing was used to investigate dynamic changes that occurred in the mouse-adapted strains during colonisation. In these animals reponses relating to the severity of inflammation and to the infecting H. pylori isolate were revealed by gene expression profiling. Previously unrealised cellular responses were uncovered. These included the significant down-regulation of both ferritin and haemoglobin expression. This perhaps suggests a mechanism for H. pylori induced iron deficiency anaemia. Physiological connections between colonisation, acid secretion and expression of the endocrine hormones were also implicated. These experiments have shown the utility of microarray analysis in the investigation of pathogenesis and have highlighted many directions for further investigation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Helicobacter pylori</field><field name="subject">DNA microarrays</field><field name="subject">Mice -- Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations in post-traumatic syringomyelia</field><field name="creator">Brodbelt, Andrew Robert, Prince of Wales Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Object. More than a quarter of spinal cord injured patients will develop an enlarging cystic cavity, or syrinx, within the spinal cord up to 30 years following the initial trauma.  Enlarging syrinxes can cause progressive loss of function in patients who often already have a disability.  Less than half the affected patients can be expected to improve following treatment.  A lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease is hampering attempts to improve on this poor prognosis.  Investigation into the mechanisms of fluid flow and the role of ischaemia in this type of syringomyelia may help understand the causative mechanisms and lead to improved treatment outcomes. Materials and methods. Temporal and dose profiling of an animal model of post-traumatic syringomyelia was performed in Sprague Dawley rats.  The cerebrospinal fluid tracer, horseradish peroxidase, was used for detailed analysis of the routes of fluid flow into the syrinx.  The effects of variations in subarachnoid space compliance on syrinx formation and fluid flow were examined using shunt insertion, pseudomeningocele formation, and animals without subarachnoid adhesions.  Local spinal cord blood flow was investigated with Doppler flowmetry, and the intracellular levels of ATP and adenosine phosphates were measured with a bioluminescence technique. Results.  A reliable animal model that mimicked human syrinx pathology was refined.  Excitotoxic injury selectively damaged neurones, and induced syrinx formation in a dose and time dependent fashion.  Cerebrospinal fluid flows from the subarachnoid space along perivascular spaces into the cord and syrinx.  Flow occurred along the perivascular spaces of the central branches of the anterior spinal artery, and was maximal at the level of the syrinx.  Improving compliance by shunt insertion reduced syrinx size but preferential fluid movement into the syrinx was maintained.  If arachnoid adhesions were absent, this preferential flow ceased and syrinxes were smaller.  Pseudomeningocele formation proved technically difficult and was unhelpful in changing cord compliance.  Spinal cord blood flow was decreased following syrinx formation.  Early reductions occurred in ATP and ADP levels, and the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio remained below 0.2 at all time points following syrinx induction. Conclusions.  CSF moves into the syrinx and spinal cord along perivascular spaces.  Arachnoid adhesions may act to decrease localized subarachnoid space compliance and encourage fluid flow from the subarachnoid space along perivascular spaces and into the syrinx.  Increasing distal subarachnoid space compliance does not prevent this preferential flow but may reduce the amount of flow.  Fluid accumulation within the syrinx causes ischaemia through pressure effects on the surrounding spinal cord tissue, and may further syrinx enlargement by apoptosis.  The results support and are consistent with a local arterial pulsation dependent pumping mechanism of cerebrospinal fluid flow.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Syringomyelia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Basket weavers and true believers : the middle class left and the ALP Leichhardt Municipality c. 1970-1990</field><field name="creator">Harris, Tony, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the two decades between 1970 and 1990, hundreds of people passed through the ALP branches of Leichhardt Municipality. These were predominantly members of what this thesis calls a 'middle class Left', employed in professions and para-professions like teaching or the public service and motivated, to one degree or another, by the social movements and politics of the late 1960's and early 1970's. This is a social history incorporating the life histories of a selection of these people. It is set against the backdrop of conflicts with incumbent, conservative, working class-based political machines and the political climate of the times. The thesis is in four parts. Part I, the introduction, establishes the point of view of the writer as it shapes what is also a 'participant history'. In this context, and that of the oral history interviews, the introduction addresses the relationship between memory and history. Parts II and III are the body of the thesis and each is lead by a 'photo-essay', recognising the complimentary importance of a visual narrative. Part II sets out the broad political topography of the 1970's and early 1980's. Chapter one describes the middle-classing of the ALP in Leichhardt Municipality, set against a review of the principal literature. It then moves through chapters two to four to examine the three loci of middle-classing: Annandale, Balmain and Glebe. Part III moves on into the 1980's when the middle class Left 'takes power'. It examines, in chapter five, the emerging, sharp, divisions among the Left on Leichhardt Council and in the contests for federal and state parliamentary seats. Chapter six examines the deepening of these divisions in the mid to late 1980's, concluding with the climactic struggle over the Mort Bay public housing project. Chapter seven looks at the diaspora of the Labor Left in Leichhardt at the end of the 1980's as the branch membership declined and many sought out political alternatives to the ALP. Part IV brings the thesis to its conclusion, focussing on the complexities and ambiguities of the middle class Left and drawing out the main socio-political themes of the two decades.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Labor Party</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Leichhardt</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Political activists</field><field name="subject">Middle class</field><field name="subject">Political activity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foot soldiers for capital: the influence of RSL racism on interwar industrial relations in Kalgoorlie and Broken Hill</field><field name="creator">Gregson, Sarah, School of Industrial Relations &amp; Organisational Behaviour, UNSW</field><field name="description">The historiography of Australian racism has principally "blamed" the labour movement for the existence of the White Australia policy and racist responses to the presence of migrant workers. This study argues that the motivations behind ruling class agitation for the White Australia policy have never been satisfactorily analysed. To address this omission, the role of the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL) in race relations is examined. As an elite-dominated, cross-class organisation with links to every section of society, it is argued that the RSL was a significant agitator for migrant exclusion and white unity in the interwar period. The thesis employs case studies, oral history and qualitative assessment of various written sources, such as newspapers, archival records and secondary material, in order to plot the dynamics of racist ideology in two major mining centres in the interwar period. The results suggest that, although labour organisations were influenced by racist ideas and frequently protested against the presence of migrant workers, it was also true that mining employers had a material interest in sowing racial division in the workplaces they controlled. The study concludes that labour movement responses to migrant labour incorporated a range of different strategies, from demands for racist exclusion to moves towards international solidarity. It also reveals examples of local and migrant workers living, working, playing and striking together in ways that contradict the dominant view of perpetual tension between workers of different nationalities. Lastly, the case studies demonstrate that local employers actively encouraged racial division in the workplace as a bulwark against industrial militancy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Returned Services League of Australia</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">industrial relations</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Kalgoorlie</field><field name="subject">racism</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Broken Hill</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collision induced timing shifts in wavelength-division-multiplexed optical fiber communications systems</field><field name="creator">Docherty, Andrew, Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Long distance repeaterless optical fiber communications systems are currently used to transmit most internet and telephone information worldwide. The growth of photonic telecommunications technology has produced systems with very high bit-rate per fiber, but this still falls short of its potential capacity. Currently systems that are able to transmit even higher bit-rates are being developed utilizing dense wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) to maximally utilize the bandwidth potential of optical fibers. One of the most important factors that limits the bit-rate achievable in a such a WDM optical communications system is the cross-talk between channels caused by pulse collisions. In this thesis a consistent mathematical theory is used to analyze the frequency and timing shifts caused collisions between two WDM channels. This theory is applied to the systems currently most promising for next-generation photonic telecommunications; the dispersion managed (DM) soliton and 'quasi-linear' systems. Self-contained formulae are obtained which accurately predict the timing shifts suffered in these systems with a wide range of parameters. These formulae require an order of magnitude less computational time that direct numerical simulations. Several mathematical techniques are introduced to obtain computationally efficient formulae for complete and incomplete collisions in both systems. For complete collisions we use the Poisson sum transform to change the calculation to a sum in the Fourier domain. For incomplete collisions we use asymptotic integration to obtain approximate formulae. For quasi-linear systems we simplify the Laplace method even further to obtain elementary formulae. We show that using a combination of these methods the timing shift for incomplete and complete collisions in a wide range of system configurations can be obtained in comparatively small computational times. We find that for systems with small DM map strength the timing shift from widely separated channels is significant. For quasi-linear systems with large DM map strength this is negligable and the timing shift decreases with the square of the channel frequency separation. We also find the timing shift from closely spaced channels is higher for quasi-linear systems than for DM soliton systems operating at the same average dispersion.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dispersion management</field><field name="subject">optical communications</field><field name="subject">timing jitter</field><field name="subject">cross phase modulation</field><field name="subject">dispersion</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chiral phosphine synthesis by the application of directed metallation</field><field name="creator">Lin, Qinghong, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The ortho metallation of some aromatic ring systems has been investigated in regard to the influence of several types of phosphorus-centred directing groups upon the reactivity, regioselectivity, and utility in later synthetic elaboration. The metallation step allows derivatisation in several useful ways, offering several routes to the synthesis of novel chiral ditertiary phosphines. Thus, an ortho lithiation of N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-P-phenylphosphonic diamide (10) led to the interesting primary phosphine, 2-(diphenylphosphino)phenylphosphine (14), after elaboration of the phosphonic diamide directing group. This primary phosphine undergoes an unprecedented facile phenyl group exchange process between its two phosphorus atoms, upon di-lithiation of the primary phosphorus centre. The primary phosphorus centre of (14) has been elaborated in several ways to yield new ditertiary phosphines. The alkylation of this centre in the copper(I) chelate complex has been investigated in several directions. In another direction, (14) has been chemically elaborated to give a new hybrid chiral ditertiary phosphine ligand, &amp;quotSemiPHOS&amp;quot, containing both a chiral phospholane ring and an adjacent diphenylphosphino group. SemiPHOS has been obtained in optically pure forms by a stereoselective synthesis and, independently, by a resolution procedure on its racemate. The molecular design of SemiPHOS was devised such that, when chelated to a metal atom, a subtle steric interaction appears to allow the chirality of the phospholane ring to influence the neighbouring diphenylphosphino group to adopt a complementary chiral conformation. This idea was tested and evaluated by applying SemiPHOS in catalytic asymmetric hydrogenations of (Z)-a-(Nacylamino) acrylate substrates to produce the R-amino acid precursors. Aryl species lithiated ortho to phosphorus-centred directing groups were coupled oxidatively by a convenient in situ method, to yield biaryl species that could then be elaborated to give biaryl ditertiary phosphine ligands. This method was used to make several atropisomeric chiral ditertiary phosphines.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phosphine -- Synthesis</field><field name="subject">Chirality</field><field name="subject">Ligand field theory</field><field name="subject">Asymmetric synthesis</field><field name="subject">Enantiomers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heterogeneous representations for reinforcement learning control of dynamic systems</field><field name="creator">McGarity, Michael, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Intelligent agents are designed to interact with, and learn about, their environment so that they can act purposefully towards a goal. One class of problems encountered in building such agents is learning how to respond to dynamic systems with a continuous state space. The goals of this dissertation are to develop a framework for understanding the behaviour of partitioned dynamic systems with continuous underlying state and to translate this framework into algorithms which adaptively form a partition of the continuous space such that the partitioned system is more easily learned and controlled, and such that the control law may be easily explained in intuitive ways. Currently, algorithms which learn a control policy for partitioned continuous state space systems treat the partitioned system as an approximation to a Markov chain. I give conditions for the partitioned system to be a Markov chain, a semi-Markov process and a new class of system, a weak-semi-Markov process. The weak-semi-Markov model is shown to model partitioned dynamic systems with greater economy than other surveyed models. The behaviour of a partitioned state space system in the area around the region boundaries is also considered. I use the theory of sliding surfaces, and some heuristic arguments to recommend region boundary shape and position. The concept of 'staying on the boundary' then becomes a robust and relatively easy subgoal within the control algorithm. The concept of 'reaching the sliding surface' as a subgoal is used as the basis for an intuitive explanation of the learnt controller. I present an algorithm based on this concept which explains the behaviour of a learnt controller in ways not previously available to a machine learning algorithms. Finally, the Markov Property and the theory of Sliding Mode Control are used as the basis of a class of recursive algorithms. These algorithms adaptively find a partition, and simultaneously use this partition in conjunction with one of five reinforcement learning algorithms to find a control policy based on that partition. This technique is shown to work very well in learning, controlling and explaining a variety of physical systems, from a monorail to a container crane.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Representation</field><field name="subject">Reinforcement Learning</field><field name="subject">Dynamic Systems</field><field name="subject">Semi-Markov Models</field><field name="subject">Markov processes</field><field name="subject">Dynamic programming</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Peter Kropotkin: ecologist, philosopher and revolutionary</field><field name="creator">Purchase, Graham, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Problem Investigated: This thesis is conceived as: [1] a work of scholarship and exegesis [2] an examination of more recent scientific works which use similar metaphors or concepts, eg. Cooperation, that are central to Kropotkin's thinking. As a work of scholarship and exegesis this thesis is an attempt to present the many areas/dimensions of Kropotkin's philosophy and thinking in a systematic way. I do not believe that this has been attempted previously in any language. Although his political, social and economic theories have generated a substantial secondary literature, Kropotkin's scientific works and philosophy of science, with the exception of his famous book, Mutual Aid, have received virtually no attention. In consequence of this the emphasis of this work will be upon his scientific writings. However, his political writings will also be examined as well as related to his broad scientific outlook. In addition to evaluating Kropotkin's scientific works in relation to his period I also discuss them in relation to contemporary debates. Although not strictly true, the second half of this thesis is not a work of historical scholarship but an attempt to bring together the ideas of scientists that in one way or another support a Kropotkinesque characterisation of natural processes. Although Kropotkin is often rightly regarded as a founder of modern environmentalism, this is difficult to substantiate from his purely political and social writings. Thus I will attempt to present the core concepts of Kropotkin's anarchism in a coherent and succinct way with an emphasis upon showing how they relate to contemporary debates and perspectives within the environmental movement. The Procedures Followed: The thesis will be introduced biographically. This seemed the best way to introduce Kropotkin's works to the reader and place them in relation to one another and in their historical context. Thus the primary purpose of this historical section is to contextualise the great diversity of works by Kropotkin. As I do not have a science background, but also for reasons of clarity, the remainder of the analysis shall be based upon the least technical and most accessible scientific literature in the various disciplines investigated. I will begin by systematically collecting, cataloguing and analysing both Kropotkin's works as well as the secondary literature and then proceed to make some overall sense of them and then relate them to contemporary debates upon process and organisation in nature and society. The General Results Obtained: My research has revealed a large body of scientific work by Kropotkin. My analysis of them shows that he had a deep understanding of the role of mutualism, symbiosis, dynamism, group and social behaviour etc., in relation to physical and biological processes. His ideas, although necessarily containing errors, are broadly, as well as in many detailed aspects, consistent with the findings of professional, though often unorthodox, scientists of the present day. The main faults of Kropotkin's approach was a fundamental failure to appreciate the role of territories and hierarchies in animal groups and his excessive progressivism. My research also reveals how Kropotkin's social vision, although somewhat utopian, can be sympathetically interpreted in terms of modern environmentalist perspectives. The Major Conclusions Reached: Kropotkin's diverse works in science and social theory when presented systematically reveals that he is a philosopher of considerable interest in respect to both contemporary and historical debates concerning sociality and its influence upon the evolution of life on Earth.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anarchists</field><field name="subject">Soviet Union</field><field name="subject">Biography</field><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Service Trading Marketplace Network (STAMP-Net): service discovery and composition for customizable adaptive network</field><field name="creator">Sookavatana, Pipat, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a complete alternative service composition model named Service Trading Marketplace Network (STAMP-Net).

Ion channels are small molecules embedded in the cell membrane and they play fundamental roles in cell function. Both topics have been extensively studied in isolation, however the role of ion channels in macrophage function is far less understood. In this thesis, the functional and molecular aspects of two ion channels expressed in macrophages, Kor, a potassium channel, and CLIC1, a chloride channel were studied. The biological function of Kor and CLIC1 in activated human macrophages was examined using ion channel blockers. In addition, the role of CLIC1 in the cell cycling of CHO-K1 cells was also investigated. The in vitro studies showed that Kor and CLIC1 are involved in cytokine production by PMA-activated human macrophages and that CLIC1 is also involved in the cell cycling of CHO-K1 cells. Despite providing interesting data, the results of the in vitro studies were difficult to interpret due to the uncertain specificities of the Cl- channel blockers. Therefore, to understand the biological role of CLIC1 in vivo, a gene targeting experiment was performed to create a CLIC1 knock-out (KO) mouse. This involved cloning the mouse CLIC1 gene, making a targeting vector, producing targeted ES cells, and generating a CLIC1 knock-in (KI) mouse which carries a flag tag at the N-terminal and three loxP sites in the targeted locus. Crossing the CLIC1 KI mouse with the TNAP-Cre mouse, a strain over expressing Cre recombinase under a TNAP promoter, a CLIC1 KO mouse was generated. The initial phenotype analysis showed no major development or growth abnormality in the CLIC1 KO mouse. Instead, hyperplasia of megakaryocytes and possible erythroid cells in the spleen and bone marrow was observed suggesting some degree of abnormality in the haematopoeitic system. Furthermore, a comparison of wild type mice with the CLIC1 KO mouse showed that CLIC1 protein expresses at high levels in monocytes, lymphocytes, platelets, and  tissue macrophages of normal animals tissues, such as spleen, kidney (mesangial cell), and liver (kupffer cells). This further indicates that CLIC1 may play a significant role in regulating functions of platelets, lymphocytes, and specially tissue macrophages. More extensive studies can now be performed on the CLIC1 KO mouse to clarify the biological function of CLIC1. In summary, the generation of the CLIC1 KO mouse provides a valuable model to study the biological function of CLIC1 both in vivo and in vitro.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Macrophages</field><field name="subject">Ion channels</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photocatalytic reduction of selenate and selenite : water/wastewater treatment and the formation of nano-selenium compounds</field><field name="creator">Tan, Thatt Yang Timothy, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The current work investigates the photocatalytic reduction of selenium (Se) ions, selenate Se(VI) and selenite Se(IV), from two perspectives: Se ion removal from water and wastewater and the formation of nano-Se compounds. Se ion pollution has become an environmental issue in recent years, and hence there is an urgent need for an efficient removal technique. In addition, there is increasing interest in the formation of nano-size semiconductors for niche applications. Since Se is a semiconductor, its formation onto the semiconductor TiO2 could lead to the discovery of new composite materials. The current study has successfully elucidated the mechanism of Se ions reduction by photocatalysis. Factors such as the simultaneous adsorption of the Se ions (the electron scavenger in this case) and a suitable organic compound (the hole scavenger), and the chemical properties of the hole scavenger were crucial for effective and efficient Se ions photoreduction. Optimum conditions in relation to pH, concentrations and types of hole scavenger were reported and discussed. It was also found that stoichiometric adsorption ratio of formate and selenate resulted to optimum photoreduction rate. A modified Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model that considered the simultaneous adsorption of both solutes was derived. The current investigation has also seen the successful formation Se deposits of different morphologies onto the TiO2 particles. Discrete Se particles of various sizes in the nano-size range as well as a Se film were deposited onto the TiO2 particles under different initial experimental conditions. The Se-TiO2 composite semiconductor was explored for the removal of cadmium Cd2+ ions, which resulted in the formation of CdSe-TiO2 systems. The photoreduction of Se ions using silver-modified TiO2 showed the enhanced reduction of Se ions to Se2- in the form of H2Se gas. It is suggested that the H2Se gas generated from the current photoreduction process could be used as a safer and cheaper technique in the formation of Se-compounds such copper selenide, cadmium selenide and zinc selenide. All these compounds were widely used in optical and semiconducting devices.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="subject">Purification</field><field name="subject">Photocatalysis</field><field name="subject">Selenites</field><field name="subject">Selenium compounds</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">N-acylhomoserine lactone regulation of adhesion and biofilm differentiation in Serratia marcescens MG1</field><field name="creator">Labbate, Maurizio, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Serratia marcescens is an opportunistic pathogen involved in predominantly nosocomial infections, however, it is also implicated as a common cause of microbial keratitis.  Since many S. marcecens strains are also resistant to multiple antibiotics, this organism represents a growing public health problem.  S. marcescens MG1 utilises a regulatory system for regulation of swarming motility and exo-enzyme secretion that relies on the production of a diffusible signal identified as N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL).  The aim of this study was to determine the role of C4-HSL in surface colonisation (adhesion and biofilm formation).  In this thesis, the development of a novel biofilm in S. marcescens MG1 is described.  The biofilm comprises of an intricate and complex structure consisting of long filamentous cells, cell aggregates and cell chains.  Two C4-HSL controlled genes (bsmA and bsmB) are shown to be crucial for biofilm formation.  It is proposed that C4-HSL regulated bsmA and bsmB gene products are engaged in fine tuning aggregation at a specific time point in late biofilm development.  Since adhesion is the first stage of colonisation, the role of C4-HSL in adhesion to a hydrophilic abiotic surface (HAS) and a human corneal epithelial (HCE) cell line was assessed.  While adhesion to the HAS was found to be C4-HSL controlled, this was not the case for adhesion to the HCE cells.  In adhesion to the HAS, mutations in the following C4-HSL regulated genes resulted in reduced adhesion; a sensor kinase gene (rssA), a type I transporter gene (lipB), bsmA and bsmB.  These four genes were found to effect the expression of type I fimbriae which is proposed to be the adhesin affecting C4-HSL regulated adhesion.  While C4-HSL is not involved in adhesion to the HCE cell line, the genes bsmA and bsmB are important.  It is proposed that bsmA and bsmB dependent HCE adhesion is due to the requirement of these genes for type I fimbriae production.  Furthermore, C4-HSL was found to regulate capsule polysaccharide and OmpX production and repress cytotoxic activity against HCE cells and erythrocytes. It is proposed that cytotoxicity is mediated by ShlA haemolysin.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biofilm</field><field name="subject">Adhesion</field><field name="subject">Serratia marcescens</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving quality while reducing cost : an innovation journey</field><field name="creator">Hu, Xiao Xia, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background: Many innovative ideas have been proposed to manage and improve the quality and cost of clinical care. For many innovations, like Total Quality Management (TQM), the &amp;quotblack box&amp;quot of implementation process is not well understood. Empirical work on the process of innovation implementation in health care is limited.  Objective: This study was designed to explore how one organisation, Intermountain Health Care (IHC), an acute and primary health care provider in the USA, innovates in implementing TQM organisation-wide to improve and manage clinical quality. More broadly, the study aims to identify factors that contribute to innovation implementation in health care for clinical quality improvement, and to generate a model of innovation implementation in health care for clinical quality improvement.  Method: This thesis takes a case study approach using multiple research methods.  The main methods used comprise interviews with key personnel, assessment of organisational documents and a survey of clinicians' and managers' attitudes and beliefs.  Findings: The main finding of the research is that innovation implementation at IHC was a journey, not a destination.  Embedded in the journey were five periods and many actions and interactions, grouped into eleven elements.  The five periods were: exposing to an innovative idea, embracing the idea, extending knowledge and experience on the idea, emerging of strategies to implement the idea organisation-wide, and enacting and adapting the strategies.  The eleven elements were: gestation, shocks, plan, proliferation, fluid participation, setbacks, criteria shift, top executive involvement, relationships and infrastructure building, and adoption.  To implement TQM organization-wide, integrated structures and systems were being instituted.  The study found that resistance to change came from not only some physicians but also hospital administrators. The study also found that supportive environments played a critical role in the journey. While the TQM implementation at IHC resulted in some cost savings and some behavioural changes including clinical practice change, cultural change at the level of values and beliefs had yet to occur. Conclusion: A process-oriented integrative model of clinical service management is proposed.  The elements of an innovation, the temporal change processes, lead to formation and changes of the ongoing organisational processes, which in turn evaluate and improve the important clinical processes.  These processes integrate TQM with other quality improvement approaches; also ensure that quality is part of the dialogue between key stakeholders who are responsible for managing and improving clinical quality and costs.  These processes also are capable of dealing with dilemmas faced in health care and the constantly created managerial ideas and clinical knowledge.

As a result, there is considerable interest in automating the design (called synthesis) of these systems. Further, given the time-to-market pressures and increasing system complexities, component reuse during synthesis is being touted as a key to success. This thesis proposes a formal framework for reusing system-level components during synthesis.  Within the framework for component reuse, component matching is a key problem that must be addressed. Given the specification of a design function, and a device stored as a component in a library, component matching addresses the question of whether the device can implement the function. Often system-level components are multi-functional and generic, and it is rarely the case that the function is directly realizable by a device. Hence, an important aspect of matching is to decide whether the device can be dynamically adapted to match the function.  This thesis proposes a formalization of the matching problem using formal models of the function and device, denoted by F and D respectively. D matches F provided there exists an interface I that adapts D dynamically to produce the same behaviour as F. None of the existing implementation verification techniques within formal methods can be used to test for the existence of an I between arbitrary pairs of F and D. In this thesis, a new simulation relation called forced simulation is proposed between the states of F and D. It is then formally established that the existence of a forced simulation relation is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of I for a pair of F and d. Two kinds of forced simulation are proposed, one each for synchronous and asynchronous interactions with the environment.  Based on forced simulation, a polynomial time algorithm for automatic matching of F and D is also developed. The distinguishing feature of the algorithm is that when successful, it generates an interface that automatically adapts the device to behave like the function. The algorithm is illustrated by reusing two rogrammable components from Intel and some typical embedded controllers.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Embedded computer systems</field><field name="subject">Computer-aided design</field><field name="subject">Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Computer organization</field><field name="subject">Formal methods (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">System design</field><field name="subject">Data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20470</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of estuarine acidification on survival and growth of the Sydney rock oyster Saccostrea glomerata</field><field name="creator">Dove, Michael Colin, Geography Program, UNSW</field><field name="description">Estuarine acidification, caused by disturbance of acid sulfate soils (ASS), is a recurrent problem in eastern Australia. Affected waters are characterised by low pH and elevated concentrations of metals, principally aluminium and iron. The effects of acid and elevated metal concentrations associated with ASS, on adult Sydney rock oysters, have not been previously investigated. This study tested links between ASS-affected drainage, subsequent estuarine acidification and Sydney rock oyster production problems on the Hastings and Manning Rivers, mid north coast New South Wales. The primary objective of this thesis was to establish if estuarine acidification causes mortality and slow growth in individual Sydney rock oysters by exposing oysters to low pH, iron and aluminium using field and laboratory experiments. Water quality data showed that estuarine acidification was spatially extensive in the Hastings and Manning Rivers following heavy rainfall and was due to mineral acids originating from drained or excavated ASS. Estuarine acidification regularly affected areas used for Sydney rock oyster production following heavy rainfall. Field experiments showed that Sydney rock oyster mortality rates were significantly higher at sites exposed to ASS-affected waters compared to locations that were isolated from ASS-affected waters. Oyster mortality increased with the time of exposure and smaller oysters (mean weight = 5 g) experienced significantly higher mortality relative to larger oysters (mean weight = 29 g). This was caused by acid-induced shell degradation resulting in perforation of the smaller oysters??? under-developed shells. Additionally, Sydney rock oyster growth rates were dramatically reduced at sites exposed to ASS-affected waters and the overall mean condition index of oysters at ASS-affected field sites was significantly lower than the overall mean condition index of oysters at non-impacted sites. Findings from laboratory experiments showed that ASS-affected water alters oyster valve movements and significantly reduces oyster feeding rates at pH 5.5. Acidic treatments (pH 5.1) containing 7.64 mg L-1 of aluminium or ASS-affected water caused changes in the mantle and gill soft tissues following short-term exposure. Degenerative effects described in oysters in this study were also due to iron contained in ASS-affected waters. Iron precipitates accumulated on the shell, gills and mantle and were observed in the stomach, intestine, digestive tubules and rectum. This study concluded that Sydney rock oysters are unable to tolerate acidic conditions caused by ASS outflows and cannot be viably cultivated in acid-prone areas of the estuary.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Saccostrea glomerata</field><field name="subject">Oysters</field><field name="subject">Effects of water pollution on</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sydney Region</field><field name="subject">Acid pollution of rivers</field><field name="subject">lakes</field><field name="subject">etc.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinetics of carbide dissolution in chromium + molybdenum steels during oxidation</field><field name="creator">Susanto, Benny Laurensius, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Iron-based alloys containing 15% chromium, 2-3% molybdenum and 0.02-1.7% carbon, consisting of M23C6 and M6C carbides in an austenitic matrix were oxidised at 8500C to study their oxidation resistance and a precipitate-free zone formation. Alloy design was carried out using a thermodynamic software Thermo-Calc. Carbides in these alloys were expected to dissolve during oxidation, releasing chromium required for the protective oxide formation. Decarburisation of the matrix was expected to trigger the carbide dissolution, and form a precipitate-free zone. Transformation of the austenitic into ferritic matrix in the precipitate-free zone was expected be essential for providing a fast chromium supply to the oxide/alloy interface. Upon exposure to pure oxygen, most of the alloys oxidised non-protectively due to the fast oxidation attack and low chromium content in the matrix, while carbide dissolution was too slow. The alloys were then pre-oxidised in H2+10%H2O to grow a purely chromia scale. In this low oxygen partial pressure environment, carbides in the alloy's sub-surface dissolved and formed a ferritic precipitate-free zone. The precipitate dissolution model developed by previous investigators was then tested and proven to be valid in this iron-based alloy system. The endurance of the pre-formed chromia scale with its underlying precipitate-free zone was then tested in pure oxygen environment. All of the alloys that had successfully developed a ferritic precipitate-free zone in the pre-oxidation stage, survived the subsequent oxidation in pure oxygen up until 3 weeks observation. Although x-ray diffraction found some minor iron oxides, the oxide consisted of mainly Cr2O3. Since iron activity had increased and iron oxides had become stable after the pure oxygen gas was introduced, the growth of the precipitate-free zone had to compete with the rate at which it was consumed by oxidation.  It was concluded that the transformation from austenite to ferrite at the subsurface region of the alloy could be achieved provided that the volume fraction of the carbides did not exceed 0.2. Evidence indicated that the chromia scale grew by chromium provided by the dissolving carbides.

During that time, they have developed from a simple disc to a complex disc with channels, vanes, holes and grooves. The stopping capability of disc brakes is affected by the rate at which heat is dissipated by forced convection and the thermal capacity of the rotor. Catastrophic failure of brake rotors can occur during rapid increases or decreases in rotor temperature where regions of high temperature gradients result in high thermal strains. There is little information in the public domain regarding the relative merits of different disc brake rotor geometries, particularly in terms of airflow patterns, heat transfer rates, and internal thermal gradients. The aim of this research project was to investigate how geometrical variations affect the thermal performance of bi-directional disc brake rotors, particularly for high performance applications. Dynamometer testing showed that respectable increases in braking performance are achievable with relatively simple machining modifications. Tuft and smoke visualization techniques provided a preliminary understanding of the airflow in the passages of three distinct bi-directional rotor designs. Particle Image Velocimetry was used for detailed flow measurements which supported the numerical simulations. Computational Fluid Dynamics was used to predict the airflow and heat transfer associated with eight bi-directional brake rotor designs. The results show that 'pillared' passage designs can achieve higher heat transfer rates than traditional straight radial vane designs and that the heat loss from pillared rotors is generally more uniform than from vaned rotors. Subsequent conjugate heat transfer simulations found that temperature gradients inside pillared rotors are typically lower than inside vaned rotors. Thus failure rates due to excessive thermal strain are expected to be lower for pillared rotors. It was shown that rotor selection based solely on heat transfer rates is inappropriate and different passage designs are suited to different applications. The findings of this research will directly benefit local disc brake manufacturers, who do not have resources to conduct thorough studies comparing the thermal characteristics of different brake rotor designs.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automobiles</field><field name="subject">Disc brakes</field><field name="subject">Disks</field><field name="subject">Rotating</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Real and p-adic oscillatory integrals</field><field name="creator">Rogers, Keith McKenzie, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">After our introduction in Chapter 1,  we consider van der Corput's lemma in Chapter 2.

This can be seen from notions of Australian racial vilification legislation as inconsistent with 'free speech' rights as well as the influence of some of the basic assumptions of First Amendment jurisprudence on political speech cases in the Australian High Court. Despite the widespread existence of legislation that penalises racial vilification at State and Federal levels, there has been a rise in Australia over the past 10 years of divisive 'race' politics. Against that background, this thesis considers the scope and limits of racial vilification legislation in Australia. It is argued that First Amendment jurisprudence is inadequate in the Australian context, because it is heavily dependent upon economic metaphors, individualistic notions of identity and outdated theories of communication. It assumes that 'free speech' in terms of lack of government intervention is essential to 'democracy'. It ignores the content, context and effect of harmful speech, except in extreme cases, with the result that socially harmful speech is protected in the name of 'free speech'. This has narrowed the parameters within which racial vilification is understood and hindered the development of a broader discourse on the realities of racist harms, and the mechanisms necessary for their redress. The author calls for the development of an Australian jurisprudence of harmful speech. Failing an Australian Bill of Rights, that jurisprudence would be grounded upon the implied constitutional right of free political speech, informed by an awareness that modern structures of public speech favour a very limited range of speech and speakers. The jurisprudence would take advantage of the insights of Critical Race Theory into the connections between racial vilification and racist behaviour, as well as the personal and social harms of racial vilification. Finally, it is argued that the concepts of human dignity and equality, which underpin European discrimination legislation and notions of justice, provide a way forward for Australian jurisprudence in this area.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Race discrimination</field><field name="subject">Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Freedom of speech</field><field name="subject">Racism in language</field><field name="subject">Racism</field><field name="subject">Civil rights</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Single-electron transistors for detection of charge motion in the solid state</field><field name="creator">Brenner, Rolf, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work investigates advanced single-electron transistor (SET) devices for detection of charge motion in solid-state systems. In particular, novel, nanoscale twin-SET and double-island SET (DISET) detectors are introduced as sensitive charge detectors. Some advantages over conventional SET detectors in terms of noise performance, sensitivity and versatility are pointed out. With the prospect of present, transistor-based microelectronics facing serious limitations due to quantum effects and heat dissipation, alternative computing paradigms ??? such as quantum computers, quantum-dot cellular automata and single-electronics ??? have emerged, promising an extension of highlevel integration and computing power beyond the above limitations. The most promising proposals are based on solid-state systems, and readout of a computational result often requires ultra-sensitive charge detectors capable of sensing the motion of single charges on fast timescales. SETs have been shown to combine all these qualities. However, random fluctuations of the background charge in solid-state systems can affect SETs and cause errors during readout. A twin-SET detector is presented that consists of two independent SETs, which were used to detect controlled single electron transfers on a small, floating metal double-dot. By cross-correlating the two SET signals, rejection of random charge noise is successfully demonstrated, thus decreasing the error probability during readout. Detection of single-electron transfer in a double-dot is also demonstrated using a double-island SET. In addition, conductance suppression in this novel DISET detector allows the detection of electrostatically degenerate charge con- figurations of a double-dot, which cannot be achieved with single-island SETs. We consider the noise performance of the DISET, and an intuitive definition of the DISET charge sensitivity suggests that under certain conditions, DISETs can have a better charge sensitivity than conventional SETs, which would be attractive for quantum limited measurements. Finally we present the first study of a DISET operated at radio-frequencies (rf-DISET), compatible with charge detection on ms timescales. This capability is a prerequisite when reading out the charge state of quantum mechanical systems. A very good charge sensitivity (5.6 x 10i6 e/pHz) and noise temperature (2.1 K) of the rf-DISET setup are reported.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transistors</field><field name="subject">Detectors</field><field name="subject">Solid state physics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Petroleum geology of the Gunnedah-Bowen-Surat Basins, Northern New South Wales : stratigraphy, organic petrology and organic geochemistry</field><field name="creator">Othman, Rushdy, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The three-dimensional thermal maturity pattern has been investigated and the hydrocarbon generation potential assessed for the Permian and Triassic sequences of the southern Bowen and northern Gunnedah Basins and the lower part of the overlying Jurassic Cretaceous Surat Basin sequence in northern New South Wales. An oil-source rock correlation also has been investigated in the Gunnedah Basin. Vitrinite reflectance measurements were conducted on 256 samples from 28 boreholes. A total of 50 of these samples were subjected to Rock-Eval pyrolysis analysis, and 28 samples extracted for additional organic geochemical studies (GCMS). A re-evaluation of the stratigraphy in the southern Bowen Basin and a stratigraphic correlation between that area and the northern Gunnedah Basin was also included in the study.  An overpressured shaly interval has been identified as a marker bed within the lower parts of the Triassic Moolayember and Napperby Formations, in the Bowen and Gunnedah Basins respectively. Suppressed vitrinite reflectance in the Permian sequence was used as another marker for mapping the stratigraphic sequence in the southern Bowen Basin. The Permian sequence in the Bowen Basin thins to the south, and probably pinches out over the Moree High and also to the west. The coal-bearing Kianga Formation is present in the north and northeastern parts of the study area. A disconformity surface between Digby and Napperby Formations in the Gunnedah Basin is probably time-equivalent to deposition of the Clematis Group and Showgrounds Sandstone in the Bowen Basin. The Clematis Group is absent in the study area, and the Moolayember Formation considered equivalent to the Napperby Formation.  Although in many cases core samples were not available, handpicking of coal or shaly materials from cuttings samples where geophysical log signatures identify these materials helped in reducing contamination from caved debris. Histogram plots of reflectance also helped where the target and caved debris were of similar lithology. Vertical profiles of the vitrinite reflectance identified suppressed intervals in the study area due to marine influence (Back Creek Group and Maules Creek Formation) and liptinite rich source organic matter (Goonbri Formation). The suppression occurs due to the perhydrous character of the preserved organic matter. High reflectance values were noted within intrusion-affected intervals, and two types of igneous intrusion profiles were identified; these are simple and complex profiles. An isoreflectance map for the non-suppressed interval at the base of the Triassic sequence in the southern Bowen Basin shows that the organic matter is mature more towards the east close to the Goondiwindi Fault, and also towards the west where the Triassic sequence directly overlies the basement. High values also occur over the Gil Gil Ridge in the middle, to the south over the Moree High, and to the north where the sequence is thicker. The reflectance gradient in the suppressed intervals is higher than in the overlying non-suppressed sequences, especially when the rank has resulted from burial depth.  Tmax from Rock-Eval pyrolysis was found to be lower in the perhydrous intervals, and was high in mature and igneous intrusion-affected intervals. Based on the source potential parameters, the Permian Back Creek Group is a better source than the Kianga Formation, while the Goonbri Formation is better than the Maules Creek Formation. The Triassic Napperby Formation has a fair capacity to generate oil, and is considered a better source rock than the equivalent Moolayember Formation. The Jurassic Walloon Coal Measures is a better source than Evergreen Formation, and has the best source rock characteristics, but is immature. The Rock-Eval S1 value shows better correlation with extracted hydrocarbon compounds (saturated and aromatics) than the total extractable organic matter. This suggests that solvent extraction has a greater ability to extract NSO compounds than temperature distillation over the Rock-Eval S1 interval. Terrestrial organic matter is the main source input for the sequences studied. This has been identified from organic petrology and from the n-alkane distributions and the relatively high C29 steranes and low sterane/hopane ratios. The absence of marine biomarker signatures in the Permian marine influenced sequence, could be attributed to their dilution by overwhelming amounts of non-marine organic matter. A mainly oxic to suboxic depositional environment is inferred from trace amounts of 25-NH, BNH and TNH. This is further supported by relatively high pr/ph ratios. Although C29/C30 is generally regarded as an environmental indicator, high values were noted in intrusion-affected samples. The 22S and 20S ratios were inverted ????reaches pseudo-equilibrium???? in such rapidly heated, high maturity samples. The ratio of C24 tetracyclic terpane to C21-C26 tricyclic terpanes decreases, instead of increasing, within the Napperby Formation close to a major igneous intrusive body. The 22S ratio, which is faster in reaction than the other terpane and sterane maturity parameters, shows that the Permian sequence lies within the oil generation stage in the Bowen Basin, except for a Kianga Formation sample. The Triassic sequence is marginally mature, and the Jurassic sequence is considered immature. In the Gunnedah Basin, the Permian sequence in Bellata-1 and Bohena-1, and the Triassic sequence in Coonarah-1A, lie within the oil generation range. In the intrusion-affected high maturity samples, the ratio is reaches pseudo-equilibrium. This and other terpane and sterane maturity parameters are not lowered (suppressed) in the perhydrous intervals. The ???????? sterane ratio, however, is slowest in reaction to maturity, and variations in low maturity samples are mainly due to facies changes. Diasterane/sterane ratios, in the current study, increase with increasing TOC content up to 5% TOC, but decrease in rocks with higher TOC contents including coals. Highly mature samples, as expected, in both cases are anomalous with high ratios. Calculated vitrinite reflectance based on the method of Radke and Welte (1983), as well as MPI 1 and MPI 2, shows the best comparison to observed values. These aromatic maturity parameters are lowered within the reflectance-suppressed intervals.  Oil stains in the Jurassic Pilliga Sandstone in the Bellata-1 well have been identified as being indigenous and not due to contamination. The vitrinite reflectance calculated to the oil stain suggests that the source rock should be within a late mature zone. Such high maturity levels are only recognised within intrusion-affected intervals. A close similarity between the oil stain sample and the intruded interval of the Napperby Formation is evident from the thermal maturity and biomarker content. Hydrocarbon generation and expulsion from the lower part of the Napperby Formation as a result of igneous intrusion effects is suggested as the source of the oil in this particular occurrence. Terpane and sterane maturity parameters increase with increasing burial depth in the intervals with suppressed (perhydrous) vitrinite reflectance. The generation maturity parameters also increase through intervals with perhydrous vitrinite, which suggests that hydrocarbons continue to be generated and the actual amount is increasing even though traditional rank ????????????stress???????????? maturity parameters are lowered. Accordingly, the Permian sequences in the lower part of the Bowen Basin are at least within the peak oil generation zone, and probably within late oil generation in the north and northeast of the study area. To generate significant amounts of hydrocarbon, however, the thickness of the shaly and coaly intervals in the Permian sequence is probably a critical parameter. In the Gunnedah Basin, a significant amount of hydrocarbon generation is probably only possible as a result of igneous intrusions.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Petroleum</field><field name="subject">Geology</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Gunnedah Basin</field><field name="subject">Surat Basin</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Bowen Basin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of personal strengths and moral reasoning in gifted adolescents</field><field name="creator">O???Leary, Kay, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study was designed to investigate the attitudes of academically gifted adolescents towards the development of their personal strengths or gifts and to compare these with the attitudes of age peers not identified as gifted. This study also examined the reported higher levels of moral reasoning in gifted adolescents compared to age peers and how this may relate to their development of academic potential. The 750 participants included 401 identified gifted students and 349 students not identified as gifted in Years 9, 10 and 11 from seven different high schools in the Sydney Metropolitan region. An instrument entitled the Development of Personal Strengths Questionnaire was developed to analyse students??? attitudes while the Defining Issues Test (Rest, 1986) was also administered to measure moral reasoning ability. Results showed that gifted students have significantly higher levels of acknowledgement of personal strengths and reasons for developing personal strengths, which reflect altruistic motivations. Gifted students scored significantly higher on altruism and philanthropy and showed significantly higher scores on the Defining Issues Test. Aspects of developing personal strengths, on which gifted students showed no significant difference from non-identified peers were in areas of motivation and responsibility for developing these strengths. A significant, but modest, connection was found between development of personal strengths and moral reasoning. Gender differences were also examined, with males reporting higher acknowledgement of personal strengths than females and females reporting higher levels on reasons for developing personal strengths as well as altruism and philanthropy. Females also showed significantly higher scores on the Defining Issues Test. These results were consistent within the gifted participant group. It was concluded that gifted students in this study were more likely to acknowledge their personal strengths or gifts and were more inclined to hold reasons for this development which related to higher levels of altruism, philanthropy and moral reasoning.

We propose novel content adaptive methods for motion compensated 3D discrete wavelet transformation (MC 3D-DWT) of video. The proposed methods overcome problems of ghosting and non-aligned aliasing artifacts, which can arise in regions of motion model failure, when the video is reconstructed at reduced temporal or spatial resolutions. We also study schemes which facilitate simultaneous scaling of compressed video bitstreams based on both constant bit-rate and constant distortion criteria, using simple and generic scaling operations.    In regions where the motion model fails, the motion compensated temporal discrete wavelet transform (MC TDWT) causes ghosting artifacts under frame-rate scaling, due to temporal lowpass filtering along invalid motion trajectories. To avoid ghosting artifacts, we adaptively select between different lowpass filters, based on a local estimate of the motion modelling accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the proposed adaptive transform substantially removes ghosting artifacts while also preserving the high compression efficiency of the original MC TDWT.    We also study the impact of various MC 3D-DWT structures on spatial scalability. Investigating the interaction between spatial aliasing, scalability and energy compaction shows that the t+2D structure essentially has higher compression efficiency. However, where the motion model fails, structures of this form cause non-aligned aliasing artifacts under spatial scaling. We propose novel adaptive schemes to continuously adapt the structure of MC 3D-DWT based on information available within the compressed bitstream. Experimental results indicate that the proposed adaptive structure preserves the high compression efficiency of the t+2D structure while also avoiding the appearance of non-aligned aliasing artifacts under spatial scaling.    To provide simultaneous rate and distortion scaling, we study ???layered substream structure. Scaling based on distortion generates variable bit-rate traffic which satisfies the desired average bit-rate and is consistent with the requirements of leaky-bucket traffic models. We propose a novel method which also satisfies constraints on instantaneous bit-rate. This method overcomes the weakness of previous methods with small leaky-bucket buffer sizes. Simulation results indicate promising performance with both MC 3D-DWT interframe and JPEG2000 intraframe compression.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scalable video</field><field name="subject">Adaptive</field><field name="subject">video compression</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation and modelling of naturally fractured reservoirs</field><field name="creator">Tran, Nam Hong, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Naturally fractured reservoirs are generally extremely complex. The aim of characterisation and modelling of such reservoirs is to construct numerical models of rock and fractures, preparing input data for reliable stimulation and fluid flow simulation analyses. This requires the knowledge of different fracture heterogeneities and their correlations at well locations and inter-well regions.  This study addresses the issues of how to integrate different information from various field data sources and construct comprehensive discrete fracture networks for naturally fractured reservoir. The methodology combines several mathematical and artificial intelligent techniques, which include statistics, geostatistics, fuzzy neural network, stochastic simulation and simulated annealing global optimisation. The study has contributed to knowledge in characterisation and modelling of naturally fractured reservoirs in several ways. It has developed: .An effective and data-dependant fracture characterisation procedure. It examines all the conventional reservoir data sources and their roles towards characterisation of different fracture properties. The procedure has the advantage of being both comprehensive and flexible. It is able to integrate all multi-scaled and diverse fracture information from the different data sources. .An improved hybrid stochastic generation algorithm for modelling discrete fracture networks. The stochastic simulation is able to utilise both discrete and continuum fracture information. It could simulate not only complicated distributions for fracture properties (e.g. multimodal circular statistics and non-parametric distributions) but also their correlations. In addition, with the incorporation of artificial fuzzy neural simulation, discrete multifractal geometry of fracture size and fracture density distribution map could be evaluated and modelled. Compared to most of the previous fracture modelling approach, this model is more flexible and comprehensive. .An improved conditional global optimisation model for modelling discrete fracture networks. The hybrid model takes full advantages of the advanced fracture characterisation using geostatistical and fuzzy neural analyses. Discrete fractures are treated individually and yet continuum information could be modelled. Compared to the stochastic simulation approach, this model produces more representative fracture networks. Compared to the conventional optimisation programs, this model is more versatile and contains superior objective function.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fractures</field><field name="subject">reservoir</field><field name="subject">characterisation</field><field name="subject">stochastic simulation</field><field name="subject">geostatistics</field><field name="subject">optimisation</field><field name="subject">neural network</field><field name="subject">Hydrocarbon reservoirs</field><field name="subject">Computer simulation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The intransigent critic: reconsidering the reasons for Clement Greenberg???s formalist stance from the early 1930s to the early 1970s</field><field name="creator">Christofides, Sheila, School of Art History &amp; Theory, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the reasons for Greenberg???s aesthetic intransigence ??? that is, his adherence to a formalist/purist stance, and his refusal to countenance non-purist twentiethcentury avant-garde trends evident in the art he ignored or denigrated, and in the art he promoted. The most substantial body of work challenged is Cold War revisionism (exemplified by the scholarship of Francis Frascina, Serge Guilbaut, and John O???Brian) which casts Greenberg as a politically expedient party to the imperialist agendas of various CIA-funded organisations. The major conclusions reached are that: Greenberg???s aesthetic intransigence was driven by a similarly intransigent ethico-political position, and that his critical method reflected patterns of argumentation set up in ???Avant-Garde and Kitsch??? (1939). This essay, and Greenberg???s ethico-political position, derived, not least, from his direct encounter with American Nazism and anti-Semitism which led him to realise that America (with what he saw as its decadence, cultural apathy, and low-level mass taste) was as vulnerable to the threat of totalitarianism as Europe and Russia. Reflecting this fear, ???Avant-Garde and Kitsch??? had juxtaposed a stagnant, impure culture with a vigorous avantgarde culture of impeccable vintage ??? in the process infusing politics into a formalist, historical conception of modernism Greenberg first devised in the early 1930s and then augmented, during 1938-9, with Hans Hofmann???s theories and others. Thus established, this rudimentary paradigm for Greenberg???s art writing was elaborated upon and made canonical in ???Towards a Newer Laocoon??? (1940), and entrenched after the war concurrent with the entrenchment of his ethico-political position. In the face of a Stalinist/capitalist war of wills, continuing anti-Semitism, and what Greenberg perceived as increasing decadence, he continued to argue for a serious, professionally-skilled (predominantly abstract) art, which would be resistant to the ersatz, yet not dehumanized by excluding the natural. By promoting this as the only genuine avant-garde art (while ignoring or denigrating playful, humorous and anarchic avant-garde tendencies), and by reiterating in the 1950s his pre-war Marxist sympathies, Greenberg was effectively demonstrating his continued hope for a utopian culture (luxuriant, formal, informed and socialist) first visualised in the late 1930s.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art critics</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="subject">Formalism (Art)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Availability of iron to the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula</field><field name="creator">Rose, Andrew, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Iron is an essential micronutrient that is required by some microorganisms in relatively large quantities. This is problematic for those inhabiting marine environments, where iron is highly insoluble and the dissolved fraction is predominantly strongly bound to organic compounds. Due to low supply and high demand, iron limits primary productivity in many oceanic waters, and may also limit growth of organisms in coastal waters under some circumstances. Recent incidents of explosive growth (???blooms???) of the noxious filamentous cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in the coastal marine waters of Moreton Bay, Queensland, have prompted speculation that terrestrial human activities have increased iron availability to the organism, thus overcoming previous limitations on growth imposed by scarcity of the nutrient. This thesis describes work investigating the chemical form of iron in coastal waters under various environmental conditions and the way in which this influences its availability to L. majuscula. Chemical speciation of iron was investigated as a function of terrestrial-derived inputs of natural organic matter (NOM) of variable origin and sunlight in coastal marine waters, employing chemiluminescence-based and spectrophotometric techniques with high sensitivity and temporal resolution. These techniques allowed determination of iron and other chemical parameters at naturally occurring (typically nanomolar) concentrations. The mechanism of iron acquisition by L. majuscula was also investigated using a radioisotope-labelling labelling technique in addition to the other techniques described. Results indicated that iron speciation can be described by five classes: inorganic dissolved and organically complexed dissolved iron in both ferrous (reduced) and ferric (oxidised) forms, and precipitated inorganic iron. Simulation of laboratory results by numerical kinetic modelling of the processes investigated indicated that while the thermodynamic impetus is strongly towards precipitated iron, iron complexation by NOM and its reduction by sunlight-mediated processes and/or L. majuscula results in meta-stable dissolved species that are more readily available to L. majuscula. Superoxide is a critical intermediate in iron reduction by both sunlight and L. majuscula. Thus L. majuscula is capable of altering iron speciation to increase its availability, however uptake is also strongly dependent on environmental conditions and may be enhanced by increased inputs of iron, NOM and sunlight into coastal waters.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">iron</field><field name="subject">cyanobacteria</field><field name="subject">superoxide</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20569</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of environmental enrichment on fundamental cognitive processes in rats and humans</field><field name="creator">Woodcock, Elizabeth Ann, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examined whether it is possible to enhance core elements of the information processing system with specific forms of environmental stimulation.  The first series of experiments demonstrated that a preweaning environmental enrichment procedure that provided 60 minutes of daily multisensory stimulation accelerated the development of long-term contextual memory and enhanced inhibitory processing in young rats.  That is, whilst stimulated and non-stimulated rats exhibited long-term memory of a context at 26 days of age, only stimulated rats showed this ability at 18 days of age.  In addition, stimulated rats showed a faster rate of extinction of long-term contextual memory at 21 days of age, which was taken as evidence of enhanced inhibitory learning (i.e., context ??? no US) in these rats. Subsequent experiments with adult rats demonstrated that a combination of preweaning multisensory stimulation and postweaning rearing in an enriched environment improved the (1) specificity of long-term contextual memory, (2) speed of contextual information processing, and (3) availability of attentional resources.  More specifically, enriched-reared rats demonstrated superior ability to discriminate between two similar contexts in comparison to standard-reared rats.  In addition, enriched-reared rats showed superior memory of a context when there was limited time available to form a memory of that context.  This finding was taken to indicate that rats that receive environmental enrichment are able to process contextual information more rapidly.  Finally, standard-, but not enriched-, reared rats showed less conditioning to a discrete stimulus when it was presented in combination with a stronger stimulus during training compared to when it was presented by itself.  The finding that enriched-reared rats did not show this overshadowing effect suggests that these rats have greater availability of attentional resources to divide between two stimuli that are competing for attention. The experiments with rats were followed by two experiments with children that investigated the effects of a computerised cognitive training procedure on information-processing speed.  These experiments demonstrated that 30-minutes per weekday of training in rapid decision-making for three to five weeks improved children???s performance on two tests of processing speed (i.e., a choice reaction time and odd-man-out task).  In addition, the speeded training improved children???s ability to sustain their attention and inhibit impulsive responses on a continuous performance test (Test of Variables of Attention).  The cognitive training procedure had no effect on children???s performance on a measure of fluid intelligence (Raven???s Standard Progressive Matrices). The results of the experiments reported in this thesis suggest that a number of fundamental cognitive processes can be modified by environmental conditions that place increasing demands on the information-processing system.  A neurobiological model, focusing on myelin, axon diameter, and the glutamatergic, glucocorticoid, noradrenergic, and cholinergic systems, was proposed in order to explain the observed effects of environmental stimulation on cognition in children and rats. The rationale for attempting to enhance fundamental cognitive processes was that improving these processes should ultimately improve general intellectual functioning.  With respect to this aim, the correlational data from the present experiments with children revealed promising trends towards greater improvements on the tests of fundamental cognitive processes in those children in the training group with slower processing speed at the start of the intervention.  This finding suggests that cognitive training may be even more effective at enhancing processing speed and other fundamental cognitive processes in children with intellectual impairments???who reportedly have slower processing speed than normal children.  However, the extent to which training-related improvements in fundamental cognitive processes generalise to improvements in general cognitive functioning is unclear.  That is, there is insufficient evidence that processing speed and other fundamental cognitive processes are causally related to intelligence.  It is therefore essential that future cognitive training research is mindful of related developments within the intelligence and information processing literature.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental enrichment</field><field name="subject">enriched environment</field><field name="subject">early experience</field><field name="subject">early stimulation</field><field name="subject">fundamental cognitive processes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The production of indigenous knowledge in intellectual property law</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Jane Elizabeth, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis is an exploration of how indigenous knowledge has emerged as a subject within Australian intellectual property law. It uses the context of copyright law to illustrate this development. The work presents an analysis of the political, social and cultural intersections that influence legal possibilities and effect practical expectations of the law in this area.  The dilemma of protecting indigenous knowledge resonates with tensions that characterise intellectual property as a whole. The metaphysical dimensions of intellectual property have always been insecure but these difficulties come to the fore with the identification of boundaries and markers that establish property in indigenous subject matter. While intellectual property law is always managing difference, the politics of law are more transparent when managing indigenous concerns. Rather than assume the naturalness of the category of indigenous knowledge within law, this work interrogates the politics of its construction precisely as a ???special??? category. Employing a multidisciplinary methodology, engaging theories of governmental rationality that draws upon the scholarship of Michel Foucault to appreciate strategies of managing and directing knowledge, the thesis considers how the politics of law is infused by cultural, political, bureaucratic and individual factors. Key elements in Australia that have pushed the law to consider expressions of indigenous knowledge in intellectual property can be located in changing political environments, governmental intervention through strategic reports, cultural sensitivity articulated in case law and innovative instances of individual agency. The intersection of these elements reveals a dynamic that exerts influence in the shape the law takes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intellectual property</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Copyright</field><field name="subject">Moral rights</field><field name="subject">Art</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australian</field><field name="subject">Cultural property</field><field name="subject">Protection</field><field name="subject">Indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">Legal status</field><field name="subject">laws</field><field name="subject">etc.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20491</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discovering hierarchy in reinforcement learning</field><field name="creator">Hengst, Bernhard, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the open problem of automatically discovering hierarchical structure in reinforcement learning. Current algorithms for reinforcement learning fail to scale as problems become more complex. Many complex environments empirically exhibit hierarchy and can be modeled as interrelated subsystems, each in turn with hierarchic structure. Subsystems are often repetitive in time and space, meaning that they reoccur as components of different tasks or occur multiple times in different circumstances in the environment. A learning agent may sometimes scale to larger problems if it successfully exploits this repetition. Evidence suggests that a bottom up approach that repetitively finds building-blocks at one level of abstraction and uses them as background knowledge at the next level of abstraction, makes learning in many complex environments tractable. An algorithm, called HEXQ, is described that automatically decomposes and solves a multi-dimensional Markov decision problem (MDP) by constructing a multi-level hierarchy of interlinked subtasks without being given the model beforehand. The effectiveness and efficiency of the HEXQ decomposition depends largely on the choice of representation in terms of the variables, their temporal relationship and whether the problem exhibits a type of constrained stochasticity. The algorithm is first developed for stochastic shortest path problems and then extended to infinite horizon problems. The operation of the algorithm is demonstrated using a number of examples including a taxi domain, various navigation tasks, the Towers of Hanoi and a larger sporting problem. The main contributions of the thesis are the automation of (1)decomposition, (2) sub-goal identification, and (3) discovery of hierarchical structure for MDPs with states described by a number of variables or features. It points the way to further scaling opportunities that encompass approximations, partial observability, selective perception, relational representations and planning.

The delivery of IMRT is commonly achieved through the use of a multileaf collimator (MLC).  One of the hindrances at present to the widespread use of IMRT is the increased time required for its planning, delivery and verification.  In this thesis one particular method of MLC based IMRT, known as Static Multileaf Collimator based IMRT (SMLC-IMRT), has been studied along with methods for improving it???s delivery efficiency.  The properties of an MLC commonly used in SMLC-IMRT have been characterised.  The potential ramifications of these properties on the dosimetric accuracy of the delivered IMRT field were also investigated.  An Interactive Leaf Sequencing (ILS) program was developed that allowed for the manipulation and processing of intensity maps using a variety of methods.  The objective of each method was to improve the delivery efficiency whilst maintaining the dosimetric quality of the IMRT treatment.  The different methods investigated were collimator angle optimisation, filtration, and intensity level optimisation.  The collimator was optimised by identifying the angle at which the minimum monitor unit???s (MU???s) were required when using a sliding-window delivery method.  A Savitzky-Golay filter was applied to random intensity maps and suitable filtration parameters identified for filtering clinical IMRT fields, and the intensity levels were optimised based on a deviation threshold.  The deviation threshold identified the acceptable level of difference tolerable between the original and modified intensity map.  Several IMRT cases were investigated and the impact of each the methods on MU???s, segments and dose distribution observed.  As the complexity of IMRT fields increases the dosimetric impact of the MLC properties increases.  Complex SMLC-IMRT fields require longer delivery times due to the increased number of MU???s and segments.  Collimator optimisation was shown to be a fast and effective means of improving delivery efficiency with negligible dosimetric change to the optimised plan.  Modifying intensity maps by applying a filter and optimising the intensity levels did reduce the complexity and improve the delivery efficiency, but also required a dosimetric compromise of the optimised plan.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intensity modulated radiotherapy</field><field name="subject">IMRT</field><field name="subject">SMLC</field><field name="subject">multileaf collimator</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20577</field></doc><doc><field name="title">(Re)producing the human : reflections on technology and nature</field><field name="creator">Harvey, Olivia, School of Sociology &amp; Anthropology, UNSW</field><field name="description">Contemporary culture abounds with stories about how new technologies are radically altering human existence. In many respects it seems intuitively obvious that there is nothing new in this, and that new techniques for doing things change social relationships. Indeed, this has been a common refrain in the modern world. Yet there is something strange about the most recent variations of how the social impact of technological change is understood. In the early twenty-first century, new technologies are argued to have changed our daily lives so much so that what we take as the most fundamental features of human experience can no longer be assumed. Specifically, in its more contemporary articulation, the argument that new technologies have radical social consequences insists that the human subject is undergoing a fundamental transformation into something entirely different: the cyborg or posthuman. 	This thesis offers an exploration of some of the assumptions that underpin contemporary accounts of new technologies and their presumed impact on human experience. Using a textual analysis methodology, this thesis takes up discussions from various areas; feminist technology studies, technology studies, the history and politics of technology as well as continental philosophy to explore changing perceptions about 'technology' and 'the human'. In addition, this thesis examines some curious examples from this diverse field in order to highlight some of the inherent ambiguities and paradoxes that endure when technology is assumed to be a detachable supplement. Assisted reproductive technologies, animal tool-use, automata, stem-cell research and human cloning, all indicate that the criteria which typically define 'the human' or 'technology' are far more amorphous than is usually presumed. What comes out of these deliberations is an intriguing tension between how both technology and human subjectivity are understood which complicates our understanding of the difference between humans and machines, nature and culture, and agency and instrumentality. In turn, this raises certain questions about the experiential implications for contemporary subjectivity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Life cycle</field><field name="subject">Human</field><field name="subject">nature</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20580</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and synthesis of new ligands and heterocycles from activated indoles</field><field name="creator">Pchalek, Karin, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">For the purpose of incorporating indoles into organometallic complexes for catalysis, as well as in the generation of new heterocyclic systems, various reactions have been carried out at C2, C6 and C7 of the indole system.  In order to achieve this, 3-substituted 4,6-dimethoxyindoles and 6-hydroxy- 4-methoxyindoles were necessary as starting materials. Consequently, a lithium-bromide-templated one-pot procedure for the synthesis of some 3-substituted 4,6-dimethoxyindoles and a selective demethylation procedure for 3-substituted 6-hydroxy-4-methoxyindoles were developed.  Various kinds of novel methylene-bridged bi-, tri-, and tetradentate pyridyl-indole ligands were synthesised via Vilsmeier-Haack, Friedel-Crafts or electrophilic addition reactions on the indole heterocycle.  However, their metal complexing properties were generally weak and variable.  Nevertheless, some of the tridentate pyridylindole ligands showed strong anion binding to halides, whereas a remarkable ligand transformation occurred with a bidentate 2-pyridylindole ligand and zinc(II), giving a substituted indolo[2,3-c]pyrrolo-[3,2,1-ij]quinoline system. Two new types of tetradentate Schiff base ligands were prepared from 2-formyl-indoles and 7-formyl-6-hydroxyindoles, and diamines.  These preformed ligands were reacted with first- and second-row transition metals to give neutral metal complexes. Novel heterocyclic systems such as 4H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolines, 3H-pyrrolo-[1,2-a]indoles, and 1H-furo[2,3-g]indoles were synthesised from 2-formyl-, 7-formyl-, and 6-hydroxyindoles, utilising mainly intra-molecular Wittig reactions, Claisen-Schmidt condensations or acid- and base-catalysed cyclisations.  A common feature of the prepared 4H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolines and 3H-pyrrolo-[1,2-a]indoles was their intense fluorescent character, which was examined as well.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">indoles</field><field name="subject">pyridines</field><field name="subject">metal complexes</field><field name="subject">ligand design</field><field name="subject">heterocyclic chemistry</field><field name="subject">Ligands</field><field name="subject">Heterocyclic compounds</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20584</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated environmental assessment of industrial products</field><field name="creator">Sun, Mingbo, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been successfully used as an environmental assessment tool for the development of ecologically sustainable products. The application of LCA in the early design stage has been constrained by the requirement of large amounts of data and time for carrying out the assessment. In addition, the complexity of LCA causes further difficulties for product developers. In order to integrate the environmental assessment into the process of product development, this research proposes an integrated decision model for sustainable product development and a simplified LCA approach for the application in the early stage of product design. The main advantage of the proposed model is that it incorporates the environmental aspects of product development into the existing product development framework. It enables designers to strike a balance between the product???s environmental performance and other traditional design objectives. The simplified LCA approach is based on the concept and application of Environmental Impact Drivers. Material-based environmental impacts and Energy-based environmental impacts are used to predict the total environmental impact of a product. Two sets of impact drivers were developed accordingly. The Material-based Impact Drivers were identified by classifying materials into 16 groups according to the nature of the materials and their environmental performance. Energy-based Impact Drivers were developed for various energy sources in major industrial regions. Product LCA cases were used to verify the proposed methods. The results computed by the application of the impact drivers were compared with the results of full LCA studies.   It is concluded that with the proposed approach, the product???s environmental performance can be assessed in a very short time and with very basic data input requirements and acceptable accuracy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">Industrial</field><field name="subject">New products</field><field name="subject">Life cycle assessment</field><field name="subject">Environmental impact analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three-dimensional (3D) three-component (3C) shallow seismic refraction surveys across a shear zone associated with dryland salinity at the Spicers Creek Catchment, New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Nikrouz, Ramin, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Dryland salinity occurs extensively throughout the Spicers Creek Catchment in central west New South Wales, Australia.  The extent of dryland salinity in the Spicers Creek Catchment has severely altered the landscape, having major environmental implication.  Large area of the catchments has experienced soil erosion resulting from the saline groundwater in the surface soil causing the destruction of clay and soil structure. The objective of this study was to use seismic refraction methods to map in detail a shear zone, which was associated with an area of major dryland salination.  In particular, both the width of shear zone and the rock fabric within it were to be mapped with two both compressional (P) and shear (S) waves using a three-dimensional (3D) array of three- component (3C) receivers. The seismic data was recorded across a shear zone which is associated with salination in the Spicers Creek Catchment using the Australian National Seismic Imaging Resources (ANSIR) 360-trace system.  Three-component (3C) geophones were used to record shear waves as well as compressional wave.  An IVI minivibrator T-15000 was used as the main source of energy for the seismic survey. The results of the three-dimensional three-component seismic refraction surveys at the Spicers Creek Catchment show that the shear zone exhibit the seismic geophysical anomaly of a shear zone, existing as a narrow region with low seismic velocities and increased depth of weathering.  A detailed analysis of the refractor seismic velocities and amplitude show a number of linear features parallel to and cross-cutting the shear zone.  Linear features cut the shear zones at each site.  They have been interpreted as a series of recent faults which act as discharge zone bringing saline groundwater to the surface.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salinity</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Spicers Creek Catchment</field><field name="subject">Seismic refraction method</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From pipe dreams to tunnel vision : engineering decision-making and Sydney's sewerage system</field><field name="creator">Beder, Sharon, Science &amp; Technology Studies (STS), UNSW</field><field name="description">The broad theme of this thesis is engineering decision-making. The various factors that shape technological development are investigated using the development of Sydney's sewerage system as a case study. The thesis focuses on various key decisions, past and present, including the choice of water-carriage technology for sewage collection, the selection of sewage treatment technologies, and on-going preference of engineers and bureaucrats for ocean disposal. Also covered are the legislative and regulatory mechanisms, the policies of the Sydney Water Board with regard to industrial waste disposal and the relationship between the Board and the public. A study was made of historical documents, engineering reports and papers, parliamentary debates, annual reports, minutes, newspaper reports and secondary sources and personal interviews were conducted. Various bodies of literature were referred to and used, including the books and articles on the history and sociology of engineers, the politics of expertise and public participation and the emerging discipline of science and technology studies. It is concluded that the development of Sydney's sewerage system has been shaped by social, political and economic factors and that engineers have played a pivotal role in the decisions made through their deliberate shaping of knowledge and the performance of predictions they have made for various options. The decisions made in this way have been defended against public opinion and public participation in the decision-making process has been kept to a minimum. This thesis supports the argument that technology is socially constructed, that the technical cannot be separated from the social, and that an interactive model of technological development is more appropriate than a linear, causal one. It shows that the role of power in the shaping of technology is crucial, and in particular the alliance of state and professional power that occurs in the shaping of public sector technology.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental controversy</field><field name="subject">engineering culture</field><field name="subject">history of technology</field><field name="subject">sewerage engineering</field><field name="subject">technological paradigms</field><field name="subject">politics of expertise</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">New SouthWales</field><field name="subject">Sewerage</field><field name="subject">Sewage disposal</field><field name="subject">Decision making</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vanishing paradise : planning and conflict in Bali</field><field name="creator">Suartika, Gusti Ayu Made, School of the Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the continuing life of Balinese culture and traditions currently under threat from unregulated economic development, mass tourism, and migration. Critical to this study are considerations surrounding the control of land and its improvements, as well as the success and failure of urban planning within the sphere of cultural conservation. The thesis argues that ???State planning systems as imposed by the Indonesian government are inappropriate in the Balinese context.??? While this statement seems fairly straightforward on the surface, it involves a complex understanding of the forces mentioned above, of their interaction and their effects on local culture. This study adopts a hermeneutic approach to theory seeking greater depth of meaning rather than discovering new facts, and embodies three main strategies. The first explains the relationship between society and space using a cultural matrix derived from anthropologist E.T.Hall. The second strategy deploys qualitative research method using focus groups, and third, it uses in-depth personal surveys at physical sites. The thesis therefore reveals the eroding impacts of tourism on local culture. Focusing on territoriality, it embraces two contradicting sets of values represented in the traditional Balinese system of Adat, and those of the market-based system of the Indonesian State. Resulting conflicts are demonstrated through specific and generic case studies. Here, the dominant position of modern state planning establishes the legal foundation on which capitalist practices, the dominating role of private enterprise, corruption, and collusionary attitudes are nourished. While the role of the government in promoting tourism, and the economic significance of the industry are acknowledged, the study measures these against the costs of such advantages to the Balinese way of life. Overall, the thesis reflects upon ongoing territorial problems that have been experienced in Bali for more than forty years. It provides an in depth analysis of how state imposed planning systems are locked in critical conflict with the proven and functioning traditional Balinese Adat. Finally, the necessary features of future planning systems are proposed in order to revitalize local culture. Hence the thesis demonstrates that modern systems of planning are inappropriate to Balinese cultural conservation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">City planning</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Bali Island</field><field name="subject">Bali Island (Indonesia)</field><field name="subject">Buildings</field><field name="subject">structures</field><field name="subject">etc.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamental aspects of the expansion of the universe and cosmic horizons</field><field name="creator">Davis, Tamara Maree, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">We use standard general relativity to clarify common misconceptions about fundamental aspects of the expansion of the Universe. In the context of the new standard Lambda-CDM cosmology we resolve conflicts in the literature regarding cosmic horizons and the Hubble sphere (distance at which recession velocity equals c) and we link these concepts to observational tests. We derive the dynamics of a non-comoving galaxy and generalize previous analyses to arbitrary FRW universes. We also derive the counter-intuitive result that objects at constant proper distance have a non-zero redshift. Receding galaxies can be blueshifted and approaching galaxies can be redshifted, even in an empty universe for which one might expect special relativity to apply. Using the empty universe model we demonstrate the relationship between special relativity and Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology. We test the generalized second law of thermodynamics (GSL) and its extension to incorporate cosmological event horizons. In spite of the fact that cosmological horizons do not generally have well-defined thermal properties, we find that the GSL is satisfied for a wide range of models. We explore in particular the relative entropic &amp;quoteworth&amp;quote of black hole versus cosmological horizon area. An intriguing set of models show an apparent entropy decrease but we anticipate this apparent violation of the GSL will disappear when solutions are available for black holes embedded in arbitrary backgrounds. Recent evidence suggests a slow increase in the fine structure constant over cosmological time scales. This raises the question of which fundamental quantities are truly constant and which might vary. We show that black hole thermodynamics may provide a means to discriminate between alternative theories invoking varying constants, because some variations in the fundamental &amp;quoteconstants&amp;quote could lead to a violation of the generalized second law of thermodynamics.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cosmology</field><field name="subject">astrophysics</field><field name="subject">expansion of universe</field><field name="subject">horizons</field><field name="subject">black holes</field><field name="subject">fundamental constants</field><field name="subject">Expanding universe</field><field name="subject">Relativity (Physics)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20640</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamental studies of oganoclays and polymer nanocomposites</field><field name="creator">Zeng, Qinghua, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Polymer materials are commonly reinforced with organic or inorganic fillers to improve their mechanical properties and to reduce the cost. Such reinforcement strongly depends on the characteristics of fillers (e.g. size, shape, aspect ratio and surface feature) and their dispersion in polymer matrix. The use of inorganic fillers exploits the synergistic effect of high mechanical strength and heat durability of fillers and processing ease of polymers. However, it often causes interfacial incompatibility and an increase in density and a loss of tenacity and opacity. Because layered clays possess rich intercalation chemistry and can be delaminated into disk-like nanopartciles, we investigate the possibility of developing polymer nanocomposites from montmorillonite (MMT). As a result, two nanomaterials, intercalated polyaniline (PANI) nanocomposites and exfoliated PS nanocomposites, have been fabricated via in situ polymerization. Morevoer, experimental work shows that the surface modification of clays and the dispersion of organically modified clays (i.e. organoclays) are crucial to the success of fabricating polymer nanocomposites. Therefore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to investigate such fundamental aspects on the structure and dynamics of organoclays and the interfacial interactions and structure of diblock copolymer (i.e. PU) nanocomposites. The simulated results are in good agreement with the available experimental data. For organoclays, the results indicate that the alkyl chains exhibit strong layered structures in the interlayer space of clays. Such layering behaviors strongly depend on the chain length and layer charge. More importantly, a pseudo-quadrilayer structure is observed for organoclays modified with dioctadecyldimethyl ammoniums in which the alkyl chains do not lie flat within a single layer but interlace and spread into the adjacent layers. Finally, different orientaion of chain segments is found in the middle and end segments, and within and out of the layer structure. For polyurethane (PU) nanocomposites, van der Waals interaction between apolar alkyl chains and PU soft segments dominates the interactions between organoclay and PU. In addition, hydrogen bonding can form between the siloxane oxygen of clay surface and nitrogen (hard segment) or oxygen (soft segments) of PU. Furthermore, there is no distinct phase-separated structure for PU in the nanocomposites, which is attributed to the results of competitive interactions among PU, alkyl ammonium and clay surface.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polymeric composites</field><field name="subject">Nanostructure materials.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20657</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The treatment of conduct problems in children with callous-unemotional traits</field><field name="creator">Hawes, David, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to determine the impact of callous-unemotional (CU) traits on treatment outcomes and processes in a 10-week behavioural parent training intervention with young boys referred for conduct problems (n=55, mean age 6.29 years). The study represents the first investigation of this risk factor in an early intervention trial, and extends the body of research examining the predictive utility of childhood CU traits in relation to subsequent antisocial behaviour. As predicted, CU traits were associated with greater conduct problems at pre-treatment, and these traits were related to poor treatment outcomes at 6-month follow-up even when controlling for baseline conduct problem severity. Consistent with the low levels of fearful inhibitions characteristic of the CU temperament, the behaviour of boys with high CU traits was less responsive to time-out discipline than that of boys without CU traits. Boys with high levels of CU traits also reacted with less affect to this discipline. The effects of CU traits on treatment outcomes and processes were not related to differences in treatment implementation by parents. These findings provide evidence that conduct problems in boys with CU traits are less responsive to changes in parenting processes than those of boys without these traits, and present important implications for the role of child temperament in the treatment of conduct problems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conduct disorders in children</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20660</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nano-grinding for fabrication of microlenses on optical fibers endfaces</field><field name="creator">Gharbia, Yousef Ahmed, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work presents mechanical nano-grinding as an alternative technique for the fabrication of optical fibers endface microlenses. It also presents a novel surface-roughness improvement technique called Loose Abrasive Blasting (LAB). Traditionally, the majority of such microlenses are made using either chemical etching or heating and pulling methods. Despite the success of these methods, they suffer some common drawbacks such as the lack of controllability on the produced lens profile. Consequently the possible variations of the lens profiles that can be made by these methods are also limited. The difficulty to center the lens on the fiber core is another problem associated with heating and pulling method. The exposure to hazardous chemical such as hydrofluoric acid is yet another problem associated with chemical etching.  Nano-grinding technique described in this thesis should provide a much better alternative to the traditional optical fabrication techniques. Nano-grinding experiments were conducted on a nano-grinding machine (NGM) specially built for this purpose. The machine incorporates state-of-the-art air-bearing spindles, piezo electric actuators, and capacitive displacement sensors with accuracy down to 2 nm. Such precise motion provided by this system is the key for the success of this technique. With such system, it was possible to produce a multitude variety of lens profiles with high profile accuracy and with surfaces of optical quality without the need for exposure to any kind of hazardous chemicals.  In achieving this objective, the research was conducted on many frontiers. First, the possibility of grinding optical fibers without inducing surface and subsurface damages was investigated. Micro-indentation, nano-indentation, and nano-scratch tests were conducted to determine the critical depth of cut that can be achieved before the occurrence of surface and subsurface cracks. Nano-scratch test in particular provided a clear insight to the cracking and the chipping mechanisms that might unfold if the critical depth of cut was exceeded in an actual grinding situation. The knowledge gained from this exercise laid the ground base for the design of the NGM.  Using the NGM, further experiments were carried out to determine the optimal grinding parameters for an efficient and successful grinding process. Parameters investigated include the grit size, the cutting speed, and the in-feed rates. The optimum parameters have to ensure the best endface surface quality and the same time maintain a high throughput. This study shows that based on these optimal parameters, it should be possible to produce endface microlenses of optical surface quality free surface and/or subsurface damages in less than 30 seconds with surface roughness (Ra) less than 3 nm.  A novel post-grinding surface improvement techniques was also developed. The technique called loose abrasive blasting (LAB) can be used for polishing at and non-flat surfaces. Experiments were conducted on a loose abrasive blasting machine built specially for this purpose. The performance of this technique was compared with other techniques such as slurry polishing and chemical etching used for polishing of brittle materials. The results showed that while chemical etching was found unsuitable for polishing of at optical fiber endfaces, LAB outperformed slurry polishing by significant margin.  After the optimal grinding conditions were established, the NGM was used for grinding of different kinds of optical fiber microlens profiles. Among the endface profiles produced were conical lenses, tapered lenses, D-shaped lenses and others. It has also been shown, in case of conical lenses for instance, that there is almost unlimited number of profiles that can be produced by simply changing the contact angle between the fiber endface and the grinding film.  The effect of surface roughness on light coupling efficiency between a fiber endface and a laser diode was also investigated. Cleaved fiber endfaces as well as ground endfaces with variant degrees of surface roughness were used in this experiment. The results showed that surface roughness has significant effect on light coupling efficiency. The effect of lens eccentricity on light coupling was also investigated.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nanotechnology</field><field name="subject">Integrated optics</field><field name="subject">Optical fibers.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology of Arabian Gulf sailfish</field><field name="creator">Hoolihan, John Paul Jr., School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Biological and life history characteristics for a previously unstudied population of sailfish, Istiophorus platypterus, in the Arabian Gulf were investigated.

Fifteen pop-up satellite archival tags were deployed on sailfish during 2001 - 2002 to track temporal and spatial movements. Extensive data from four tags showed 83.7% of time-at-depth was spent above 10 m with no significant difference (P &amp;lt 0.05) in diel preference. Depth ranged from 0.0 m to 61.0 m, while temperature ranged from 19.7 ??C to 30.1 ??C. Small-scale movements of eight sailfish were measured using ultrasonic tracking for periods ranging from 3:33 to 53:06 hours. Track distances ranged from 5.5 to 78.5 km, while linear displacement ranged from 4.6 to 37.0 km. Average speed ranged from 0.29 to 0.75 m s-1. Vertical distributions showed 84.3% of time was spent above 10 m depth, even though water temperature showed negligible variation with depth. Mitochondrial DNA comparison of 147 sailfish produced 39 composite haplotypes using eight restriction enzymes. Significant differences occurred in the frequency between population groups inside and outside the Gulf (amova 34.8%, P &amp;lt 0.01; FST = 0.356), along with evidence of restricted migration between them (average number of migrants, Nm = 0.903). Nine year classes (0-8) were determined from aging analysis of fin spines. Females (n = 50) ranged from 0 to 8 years, while males (n = 34) ranged from 0 to 6 years. Von Bertalanffy growth function indicated rapid growth during the first two years, after which males stabilized and females continued growing to a greater maximum mean length and weight. A comparison of allometric growth between sexes indicated no significant difference between length and other morphometric characters (P ranged 0.135 ??? 0.980).</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">billfish</field><field name="subject">sailfish</field><field name="subject">Istiophorus platypterus</field><field name="subject">Arabian Gulf</field><field name="subject">tagging</field><field name="subject">pop-up satellite tagging</field><field name="subject">ultrasonic tracking</field><field name="subject">genetic analyses</field><field name="subject">phylogeography</field><field name="subject">age and growth</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20755</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Without a centre that holds : the redefinition of contemporary adulthood</field><field name="creator">Blatterer, Harry, School of Sociology &amp; Anthropology, UNSW</field><field name="description">Adulthood holds a paradoxical position in sociology. It is a central category in so far as it provides the unarticulated background to a majority of social inquiries, but it is largely defined by default, as the taken-for-granted status of the social actor, and the middle stage of life. The meaning of adulthood is only rarely addressed directly. This thesis explores a way to fill this lacuna in sociology. An emerging lag between the prevalent normative ideals of adulthood and contemporary social trends is identified as the core of the 'prolonged adolescence thesis' - a dominant view in the social sciences and everyday discourse, which holds that many twenty and thirtysomethings are deferring or rejecting adulthood. My thesis argues that this approach is informed by a model of adulthood that is losing its empirical validity. I further argue that the practices of these young people are congruent with salient features of current social conditions. Drawing on theories of social recognition and the analysis of interview material, I hold that even though the form social recognition takes is subject to pluralisation, recognition of individuals' full membership in society is the meaningful constant of adulthood. I also propose that the redefinition of contemporary adulthood is marked by an intersubjectively constituted 'recognition deficit': commentators and social scientists often misunderstand young adults' practices, notwithstanding the structural rewards which these practices reap. At the same time, young adults themselves eschew the conventional markers of adult status. In so doing they forge their own, radically different, adulthood. Underpinned by an ideology of youthfulness, and subject to the fluid social relations of contemporary modernity, this adulthood eludes fixity. Its normative criteria flow from the everyday practices of individuals who, far from prolonging their adolescence, are the new adults of today.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adulthood</field><field name="subject">Sociological aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20758</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A mixed-mode GPS network processing approach for volcano deformation monitoring</field><field name="creator">Janssen, Volker, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Ground deformation due to volcanic magma intrusion is recognised as an important precursor of eruptive activity at a volcano. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is ideally suited for this application by being able to measure three-dimensional coordinate changes of the monitoring points over time. Due to the highly disturbed ionosphere in equatorial regions, particularly during times of maximum solar activity, a deformation monitoring network consisting entirely of single-frequency GPS receivers cannot deliver baseline solutions at the desired accuracy level. In this thesis, a mixed-mode GPS network approach is proposed in order to optimise the existing continuous single-frequency deformation monitoring system on the Papandayan volcano in West Java, Indonesia. A sparse network of dual-frequency GPS receivers surrounding the deformation zone is used to generate empirical 'correction terms' in order to model the regional ionosphere. These corrections are then applied to the single-frequency data of the inner network to improve the accuracy of the results by modelling the residual atmospheric biases that would otherwise be neglected.  This thesis reviews the characteristics of existing continuously operating GPS deformation monitoring networks. The UNSW-designed mixed-mode GPS-based volcano deformation monitoring system and the adopted data processing strategy are described, and details of the system's deployment in an inhospitable volcanic environment are given. A method to optimise the number of observations for deformation monitoring networks where the deforming body itself blocks out part of the sky, and thereby significantly reduces the number of GPS satellites being tracked, is presented. The ionosphere and its effects on GPS signals, with special consideration for the situation in equatorial regions, are characterised. The nature of the empirically-derived 'correction terms' is investigated by using several data sets collected over different baseline lengths, at various geographical locations, and under different ionospheric conditions. Data from a range of GPS networks of various sizes, located at different geomagnetic latitudes, including data collected on Gunung Papandayan, were processed to test the feasibility of the proposed mixed-mode deformation monitoring network approach. It was found that GPS baseline results can be improved by up to 50% in the midlatitude region when the 'correction terms' are applied, although the performance of the system degrades in close proximity to the geomagnetic equator during a solar maximum.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Volcanoes</field><field name="subject">Volcanic activity prediction</field><field name="subject">Global Positioning System</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20771</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phylogeography, population history and conservation genetics of the endangered green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea)</field><field name="creator">Burns, Emma Louise, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea) is an Australian hylid, which was once common with a relatively continuous distribution. Historically, this distribution extended from northern New South Wales (NSW), as far as Ballina, to East Gippsland in Victoria; with inland populations as far west as Bathurst and Tumut.  Today the species is reported to have disappeared from 80% of its former range and remaining populations are mostly fragmented and typically restricted to the coastline, extending from Yuraygir National Park (northern NSW) to East Gippsland.  In this thesis, I report a comprehensive study designed to identify the phylogeographic and conservation genetic parameters of L. aurea. In doing so, I also investigate evolutionary relationships within the ???bell frog??? species group. In this study, microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers are employed.  The development of species-specific microsatellite markers and the collection of samples was a substantial component of the study.  These markers and samples should prove useful for future studies of L. aurea and perhaps more generally the ???bell frogs???. Initially, a large-scale assessment of genetic structure and diversity in L. aurea using microsatellite markers was undertaken. Twenty-one locations were sampled from throughout the species range covering 1000 kilometres of the east coast of Australia.  Levels of allelic diversity and heterozygosity were high (uncorrected mean alleles/locus and HE: 4.8-8.8 and 0.43-0.8 respectively) compared to other amphibian species and significant differences among sampled sites were recorded.  Despite recent population declines, no sites displayed a genetic signature indicative of a population bottleneck.  Significant genetic structuring (overall FST = 0.172) was detected throughout the species range, but was relatively low compared to previous amphibian studies that used microsatellites. In addition, some areas sampled within continuous habitat showed evidence of weak genetic structuring (data subset FST = 0.034). Next, relationships among extant bell frogs (Litoria aurea species-group) were investigated, using mitochondrial ND4 nucleotide sequence data.  Analyses supported a clade comprised of the temperate members of the species-group, L. aurea, L. cyclorhyncha, L. moorei, and L. raniformis but failed to support the inclusion of the tropical bell frog L. dahlii in this group.  Relationships among the four members of the bell frog clade correlated with geographical distribution: the south-western Australian bell frogs (L. cyclorhyncha, L. moorei) and the south-eastern Australian bell frogs (L. aurea, L. raniformis) were reciprocally monophyletic.  Results also indicated that divergence of these two lineages occurred during the late Miocene, which was consistent with results of previous studies and with more general assertions that much of the major differentiation and radiation of the Australian biota predated the Quaternary. Following this, intraspecific phylogeography of L. aurea using two mitochondrial genes COI and ND4 was investigated. I examined extant populations from throughout the species??? range, sequencing 263 individuals from twenty-six locations.  Recent evolutionary history, as well as the current population structure of L. aurea, was inferred from the resulting pattern of genetic variation amongst haplotypes, in conjunction with demographic and population analyses.  Results indicated that there were no phylogeographic divisions within L. aurea, despite a general consensus that amphibians are highly structured.  However, I did still detect significant structure amongst extant populations (FST = 0.385).  Overall, patterns of haplotype relatedness, high haplotypic diversity (mean h = 0.547) relative to low nucleotide diversity (mean Pi= 0.003), and mismatch distribution analysis supported a Pleistocene expansion hypothesis with continued restricted dispersal and gene flow. Taken together, the results of this thesis indicate that L. aurea is a species with relatively weak population and phylogeographic structure compared to other amphibians.  The data provide no support for the existence of distinct evolutionary lineages within L. aurea, implying that there are no historically isolated populations that should be viewed as separate evolutionarily significant units.  Nevertheless, remaining populations are still significantly structured but not all populations are genetically distinct. Low phylogeographic structure, coupled with evidence for recent gene flow among many sites would permit ???well managed??? intervention to mediate gene flow amongst currently isolated populations, and I provide some guidelines for the implementation of such conservation strategies.  However, there is no evidence to suggest that supplementation through artificial immigration is at this time necessary given current levels of genetic variation within populations.  In the short-term, conservation management in L. aurea should focus on the protection of local populations and habitat to promote population connectivity to ensure processes that maintain adaptive diversity and evolutionary potential are conserved.  Preservation of the species??? natural range and the maintenance of dense networks of suitable habitat, in conjunction with maximising local carrying capacity and reproductive output, as well as minimising known threats, are key to securing the long-term persistence of the green and golden bell frog.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Litoria aurea</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Frogs.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The kinematics and dynamics of cross-hemispheric flow in the Central and Eastern Equatorial Pacific</field><field name="creator">Brown, Jaclyn Nicole, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns two topics: the kinematics of Pacific cross-equatorial flow ??? the location, timing and magnitude of the flow; and their dynamics???what are the driving forces controlling the flow? Despite extensive observations in the central and eastern Pacific, observations of these flows remain contradictory. We use output from an Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) viewed from a Lagrangian framework on density layers. This addresses the problem of high variability due to features such as Tropical Instability Waves.   The annual mean flow is found to be southward nearly everywhere, east of 140??W. Flow becomes stronger in the second half of the year due to a bolus transport of very light surface water, introduced by Tropical Instability Waves. A Tropical Cell pattern occurs along the equator that does not require diapycnal downwelling.   From 160??E to 160??W the annual mean flow is northward, occurring mostly in the mixed layer, appearing to originate partly from the Equatorial Undercurrent surfacing in the east. The northward flow is strongest in March and becomes southward in September.   The wind stress and nonlinear terms are shown to be the key driving features, with a prescribed biharmonic Smagorinsky horizontal friction scheme having negligible impact. From 160??E to 160??W, the flow is partly accounted for by an Ekman forcing, with the curl of the nonlinear term providing a crucial additional torque, more than doubling the magnitude in some instances. From 160??W to 120??W the wind stress curl provides a weak southward flow of about 1 Sv, which increases by the nonlinear addition to around 5 Sv.   The curl of the steady component of the nonlinear term, derived from annual mean currents, is similar in structure to the total nonlinear term, but higher in magnitude. The structure of the variable term, which was mostly of opposite sign to the steady term, suggests damping occurs in place of friction.   While our study is limited to an examination of the model's characteristics, our results provide important clues to the observed flow patterns not resolved by present-day measurements. This study also highlights the importance of time-space variability and both horizontal and vertical density structure in controlling the flow and its feedback on the system.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ocean circulation</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Lagrange equations</field><field name="subject">Pacific Area</field><field name="subject">Climate.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20831</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of cultural value orientation on customer perceptions of post-recovery service satisfaction in an Eastern context</field><field name="creator">Prasongsukarn, Kriengsin, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">It is now well recognised that an effective service recovery program is an essential part of firms??? service quality programs and critical to generating customer satisfaction and loyalty. A number of studies have investigated the impact of service recovery efforts (compensation, speed of response, etc.) on post-recovery satisfaction, mostly in Western countries. However, despite the importance of global markets, very few have examined how Eastern consumers react to service recovery efforts. Furthermore, none have examined the impact of cultural value orientation (cultural values measured at the individual level) in implementing effective service recovery programs. This is one of the few studies that have attempted to avoid the ecological fallacy, i.e., assume all consumers within a country are culturally homogeneous. Based on Justice Theory, this research conducted in Thailand, employed an experimental design to investigate how customer evaluations of service recovery efforts are influenced by interplay of the consumer???s cultural value orientation and service recovery attributes (apology, compensation, cognitive control, recovery initiation, and formality). The results reveal that cultural values of power distance, uncertainty avoidance and collectivism do indeed interact with a firm???s recovery tactics to influence perceptions of justice. In other words, the impact of a firm???s tactics is culturally dependent, and consumer expectations and perceptions of service recovery efforts vary, depending on customers??? cultural value orientation. Finally, all three forms of justice (distributive, procedural, interactional) along with disconfirmation of expectations, positively impact on overall service recovery satisfaction.  Unlike previous studies, we found evidence to indicate that there is a temporal sequence associated with the three justice dimensions i.e., interactional and procedural justice precede and thus impact perception of distributive (outcome) justice. The results have implication for marketing theory as well as managerial action.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">service recovery</field><field name="subject">service failure</field><field name="subject">cultural values</field><field name="subject">satisfaction</field><field name="subject">justice theory</field><field name="subject">Consumer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Customer services</field><field name="subject">Cross-cultural orientation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ear, nose and throat surgery among young Australian children</field><field name="creator">Rob, Marilyn Isobel, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy and myringotomy are the most common surgical procedures undergone by children.  Medical opinion regarding the appropriateness of these procedures remains contentious, and considerable resources have been expended in the formulation and distribution of relevant practice guidelines.  The impact of this surgery on the child, community and private and public health resources is considerable, yet there has been little examination of surgery rates and trends, or of the characteristics of children who undergo surgery.  This thesis addressed five major questions regarding this surgery in New South Wales, Australia.  The first three related to population rates: the level of surgery among NSW children, comparability with international rates, trends over time and the effect of guidelines.  Comprehensive hospital data between 1981 and 1999 were analysed.  Major findings were a higher myringotomy rate in NSW than reported internationally, the short-term effect of guidelines, and a major shift towards children having surgery at a younger age.  The remaining questions asked whether children who had surgery differed from other children in their use of health services prior to surgery, and if so, whether their utilization reverted to the norm following surgery.  Matched records of a population cohort of 6239 NSW children, born during January 1990, were extracted from Health Insurance Commission data, and their claims for medical services followed retrospectively from birth to 8 years.  Children who had privately funded surgery were found to use more medical services than other children, and, most unexpectedly, this did not change following surgery.  The results suggest potential non-clinical factors influencing this excess utilization.  This is the first population study to examine health service utilisation by these children and it has identified an important new risk factor for surgery.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adenoidectomy</field><field name="subject">tonsillectomy</field><field name="subject">tympanostomy tube insertion</field><field name="subject">guidelines</field><field name="subject">trends</field><field name="subject">health services utilisation</field><field name="subject">Otolaryngology</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Surgery</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinetics and modelling of enzymatic process for R-phenylacetylcarbinol (PAC) production</field><field name="creator">Leksawasdi, Noppol, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences (BABS), UNSW</field><field name="description">R-phenylacetylcarbinol (PAC) is used as a precursor for production of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, which are anti-asthmatics and nasal decongestants. PAC is produced from benzaldehyde and pyruvate mediated by pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC). A strain of Rhizopus javanicus was evaluated for its production of PDC. The morphology of R. javanicus was influenced by the degree of aeration/agitation. A relatively high specific PDC activity (328 U decarboxylase g-1 mycelium) was achieved when aeration/agitation were reduced significantly in the latter stages of cultivation.  The stability of partially purified PDC and crude extract from R. javanicus were evaluated by examining the enzyme deactivation kinetic in various conditions. R. javanicus PDC was less stable than Candida utilis PDC currently used in our group.  A kinetic model for the deactivation of partially purified PDC extracted from C. utilis by benzaldehyde (0?00 mM) in 2.5 M MOPS buffer has been developed. An initial lag period prior to deactivation was found to occur, with first order dependencies of PDC deactivation on exposure time and on benzaldehyde concentration. A mathematical model for the enzymatic biotransformation of PAC and its associated by-products has been developed using a schematic method devised by King and Altman (1956) for deriving the rate equations. The rate equations for substrates, product and by-products have been derived from the patterns for yeast PDC and combined with a deactivation model for PDC from C. utilis. Initial rate and biotransformation studies were applied to refine and validate a mathematical model for PAC production. The rate of PAC formation was directly proportional to the enzyme activity level up to 5.0 U carboligase ml-1. Michaelis-Menten kinetics were determined for the effect of pyruvate concentration on the reaction rate. The effect of benzaldehyde on the rate of PAC production followed the sigmoidal shape of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model. The biotransformation model, which also included a term for PDC inactivation by benzaldehyde, was used to determine the overall rate constants for the formation of PAC, acetaldehyde and acetoin.  Implementation of digital pH control for PAC production in a well-stirred organic-aqueous two-phase biotransformation system with 20 mM MOPS and 2.5 M dipropylene glycol (DPG) in aqueous phase resulted in similar level of PAC production [1.01 M (151 g l-1) in an organic phase and 115 mM (17.2 g l-1) in an aqueous phase after 47 h] to the system with a more expensive 2.5 M MOPS buffer.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biotransformation</field><field name="subject">ephedrine</field><field name="subject">pseudoephedrine</field><field name="subject">mathematical modelling</field><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="subject">enzyme technology</field><field name="subject">digital pH control</field><field name="subject">phenylacetylcarbinol</field><field name="subject">pyruvate decarboxylase</field><field name="subject">biocatalyst</field><field name="subject">benzaldehyde</field><field name="subject">pyruvate</field><field name="subject">enzymes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20846</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On complex reflection groups G(m, 1, r) and their Hecke algebras</field><field name="creator">Mak, Chi Kin, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">We construct an algorithm for getting a reduced expression for any element in a complex reflection group G(m, 1, r) by sorting the element, which is in the form of a sequence of complex numbers, to the identity. Thus, the algorithm provides us a set of reduced expressions, one for each element. We establish a one-one correspondence between the set of all reduced expressions for an element and a set of certain sorting sequences which turn the element to the identity. In particular, this provides us with a combinatorial method to check whether an expression is reduced. We also prove analogues of the exchange condition and the strong exchange condition for elements in a G(m, 1, r). A Bruhat order on the groups is also defined and investigated. We generalize the Geck-Pfeiffer reducibility theorem for finite Coxeter groups to the groups G(m, 1, r). Based on this, we prove that a character value of any element in an Ariki-Koike algebra (the Hecke algebra of a G(m, 1, r)) can be determined by the character values of some special elements in the algebra. These special elements correspond to the reduced expressions, which are constructed by the algorithm, for some special conjugacy class representatives of minimal length, one in each class. Quasi-parabolic subgroups are introduced for investigating representations of Ariki- Koike algebras. We use n x n arrays of non-negative integer sequences to characterize double cosets of quasi-parabolic subgroups. We define an analogue of permutation modules, for Ariki-Koike algebras, corresponding to certain subgroups indexed by multicompositions. These subgroups are naturally corresponding, not necessarily one-one, to quasi-parabolic subgroups. We prove that each of these modules is free and has a basis indexed by right cosets of the corresponding quasi-parabolic subgroup.

Analysis of relevant literature and theory suggests that restorative justice is a broad and encompassing movement that entails a decision making process where victims, communities and offenders come together in a joint response to an offence.  Although this breadth has allowed and encouraged a proliferation of programs that respond to particular needs and particular demands of culture and social context, the consequence is that both understandings and practices of restorative justices are variable.  When theoretical understandings are so varied there will necessarily be a lack of commonality in the way principles are articulated.  If practice is not linked directly to principled theory it is inevitable that processes will be vulnerable at all levels to the interaction between context, situations and participant characteristics that may easily deflect the focus from the true purpose of restorative justice.  This thesis attempts to clarify the restorative principles relevant to the NSW program with reference to Braithwaite and Pettit???s republican theory (1990) and their notion of dominion.  In turn these principles are used to identify five practical elements to be used as a framework to guide youth conferences.  Such a framework highlights potential areas for improvement in conference preparation and practice.  A case study approach was used to collect data and involved the observation of eighty five Youth Justice Conferences in three New South Wales conferencing regions. As well, one hundred and fifty two currently practising Youth Justice Conferencing practitioners (Police, Conveners, Managers) in New South Wales completed a mail out questionnaire.  Findings from the study suggest that conference processes are influenced by the presence or absence of five particular elements: the attendance of victims, the attendance of communities, the attendance of offender support, reparation to victims, communities and offenders and the experience of non-domination during the conference space.  However, findings also suggest that ???situational??? factors may mediate these key elements to enhance or compromise the overall process.  This thesis suggests that many of the issues arising in NSW conferences result from the failure to articulate the links between restorative justice theory and practice. While in NSW such links may intentionally have been unarticulated in order to encourage a freedom within the process, in reality the lack of clarification has led to a freedom in discretion that sometimes diminishes the chance of success.  Therefore it proposes the need for a more articulated translation of theory into principles that will in turn frame practice.  In this way the thesis uses the normative theory proposed by Braithwaite and Pettit (1990) to provide an explanatory and ideal framework for best practice in NSW Youth Justice Conferencing.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">youth justice conferencing</field><field name="subject">restorative justice</field><field name="subject">young offenders</field><field name="subject">criminal justice</field><field name="subject">Juvenile justice</field><field name="subject">Administration of</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Juvenile delinquents</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20780</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interrupted ageing of Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloys</field><field name="creator">Buha, Joka, School of Materials Science &amp; engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis systematically investigates the effects of a recently developed modified ageing procedure of aluminium alloys, termed the T6I6 temper, on the microstructural development and mechanical properties of the Al ??? Mg ??? Si - Cu alloy 6061. For the T6I6 temper, a conventional single stage T6 temper is interrupted by an ageing period at a reduced temperature (65??C) to facilitate secondary precipitation, before resuming the final ageing at the temperature of the initial T6 treatment. The T6I6 temper was found to cause simultaneous increases in tensile properties, hardness, and toughness as compared with 6061 T6.  Al ??? Mg ??? Si ??? Cu alloys are medium strength alloys widely used in the automotive industry and their further improvement is underpinned by stringent demands for weight reduction placed on the transportation industry in recent years. The potential for further improvement of the mechanical properties was found in the control of secondary precipitation that may take place even in some fully aged alloys when exposed to reduced temperatures.  The overall improvement in the mechanical properties of 6061 T6I6 was attributed to the formation of finer and more densely dispersed precipitates in the final microstructure. The refinement of precipitates was facilitated by control of the precipitation processes and gradual evolution of the microstructure throughout each stage of the T6I6 treatment. The results indicated that the concentration and the chemical environment of the vacancies controlled the precipitation processes in this alloy. Findings also show that the proportion of the different precipitate phases present in the final microstructure, as well as the amount of the solute in these precipitates, can be controlled and modified utilizing secondary precipitation.  A number of analytical techniques were used in this study. The evolution of the microstructure was studied using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), High Resolution TEM (HRTEM) and Three Dimensional Atom Probe (3DAP). Vacancy-solute interactions were studied using Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS) and 3DAP. The distribution of the solute was studied using 3DAP and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).

These studies were supplemented with investigations on one metallurgical coke for the sake of comparison. The wettability of coal chars and coke with liquid iron at 1550 degrees C was measured as a function of time.

The accumulation of alumina at the interface was detected for all materials and was seen to increase with time in all cases. Calcium and sulphur also appeared to preferentially accumulate at the interface, concentrating at levels in excess of those expected from the ash composition alone. Despite the high levels of silica in the ash initially, very little silica was detected in the interfacial region, implying ongoing silica reduction reactions. A small amount of silicon was however detected in the iron droplets, indicating silica reduction with solute carbon. It was identified that the reduction reactions can also consume solute carbon in the liquid iron. As this is occurring simultaneously with carbon dissolution into liquid iron, the interdependency of silica reduction and carbon dissolution could potentially limit the observed carbon dissolution rate.  A theoretical model was developed for estimating the interfacial contact area between chars and liquid iron. Wettability was found to have a very significant effect on the area of contact. A two-step behaviour was observed in the carbon dissolution of two chars and coke. Slow rates of carbon dissolution in stage II were attributed to very high levels of interfacial blockage by reaction products leading to much reduced areas of contact between carbonaceous material and liquid iron. The first order dissolution rate constants for four chars/coke and the observed trend in first order dissolution rate constants were calculated. These dissolution results compare well with the previously measured dissolution rate constants. The trends in dissolution can be adequately explained on the basis of carbon structure, silica reduction, sulphur concentration in the metal and ash impurities.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">carbon dissolution</field><field name="subject">iron</field><field name="subject">wettability</field><field name="subject">interfacial reaction</field><field name="subject">ash reaction</field><field name="subject">Blast furnaces</field><field name="subject">Coal</field><field name="subject">Pulverized</field><field name="subject">Liquid iron</field><field name="subject">Char</field><field name="subject">Wetting.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20797</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of national culture on the planning and purchase-consumption behaviour of international leisure travellers</field><field name="creator">Ahn, Inja, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research investigates the influence of national culture on the trip planning and purchase-consumption behaviour of international leisure travellers. This study focuses on achieving a theory-driven, rigorous study that covers a large number of national cultures in empirically testing systematic relations between national values and overseas leisure travel behaviour. The study proposes a conceptual model linking four sets of generalized national value dimensions drawn from the Hofstede, Schwartz and Inglehart studies with trip planning and purchase-consumption behaviours, drawing on and extending the model of a tourism consumption system suggested by Woodside and King (2001). Both country- and individual-level control variables are incorporated in the model. Per capita GDP and statutory annual leave are country-level covariates; prior-destination experience, trip purpose, age and gender are individual-level covariates. In addition to these covariates, trip itinerary planning and total external search are included in models of consumption behaviours.  Secondary data obtained from the quarterly Australian International Visitor Survey (from quarter one 2000) is used to test the proposed model. The final sample for the study comprises international leisure travellers from 22 Asian, European and North American countries. Trip planning and consumption behaviours are taken as the dependent variables in a series of weighted and multi-level (HLM) regression models where the independent variables include national values, per capita income and statutory leave (at the country-level) and four travel segments constructed from prior-destination experience and trip purpose, age and gender at the individual-level, as well as trip itinerary planning and total search.    The study found that national values play a significant role in influencing both trip planning and purchase-consumption behaviour. National values were found to have a stronger impact on trip planning behaviours than on consumption behaviours at a destination. The four sets of national values differed in explanatory power as did, the three national culture models in an international tourism context, although there was substantial convergent validity across the three models of national culture. The impact of national values on overseas leisure travel behaviour was strongest among the holiday travellers and the youngest (15-24) female tourists, followed by older (45-55plus) tourists.  The study contributes a theory-driven, rigorous investigation of national culture and overseas leisure travel behaviour by provision of comprehensive conceptual model and by empirically testing the hypotheses on a large number of countries. It enriches our understanding of the role of national culture on cross-cultural consumer behaviour. The study's findings may assist in developing more effective international destination marketing strategy (e.g., positioning, communication and products-services development) by showing the potential usefulness of national values. Finally, several avenues for future research are suggested including direct measurement of cultural values, further empirical testing based on larger samples, further advances in the conceptual model adding post-purchase behaviour and other confounding variables.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Travel</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Consumer behavior</field><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">Social aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20803</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of gas-powder-liquid-solid multiphase flow in a blast furnace</field><field name="creator">Dong, Xuefeng, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The ironmaking blast furnace (BF) is a complex reaction vessel involving counter-, coand/ or cross-current flows of gas, powder, liquid, and solids. However, the interactions of these multiphase flows have not been completely understood. The objective of this thesis is to develop a suitable model to simulate the powder flow and accumulation in packed beds and then extend it to numerically investigate the multiphase flow in the furnace. Gas-powder flow in a slot type packed bed has been experimentally studied in order to understand the flow and accumulation behaviour of powder in systems like an ironmaking blast furnace. A variety of variables including gas flowrate, powder flowrate and packing properties have been taken into consideration. It is found that a clear and stable accumulation region can form in the low gas-powder velocity zone at the bottom of the bed. The accumulation region is stable and shows strong hysteresis. The distribution of softening-melting layers in the blast furnace known as the cohesive zone (CZ) is modelled by inserting solid blocks into the bed. The results indicate that the inverse-V cohesive zone shape leads to low powder accumulation within the CZ and at the corner of the bed. A mathematical model is proposed to describe gas-powder flow in a bed packed with particles. The model is the same as the two fluid model developed on the basis of the space-averaged theorem in terms of the governing equations but extended to consider the interactions between gas, powder and packed particles, as well as the static and dynamic holdups of powder. In particular, a method is proposed to determine the boundary between dynamic and stagnant zones with respect to powder phase, i.e. the profile of the powder accumulation zone. The validity of numerical modelling is examined by comparing the predicted and measured distributions of powder flow and accumulation under various flow conditions. With high PCI rate operations, a large quantity of unburned coal/char fines flow together with the gas into the blast furnace. Under some operating conditions, the holdup of fines results in deterioration of furnace permeability and lower production efficiency. Therefore, the proposed model is applied to simulate the powder (unburnt coal/char) flow and accumulation inside the blast furnace when operating with different cohesive zone (CZ) shapes. The results indicate that powder is likely to accumulate at the lower part of W-shaped CZs and the upper part of V- and inverse V-shaped CZs. In addition, for the same CZ shape, a thick cohesive layer can lead to a large pressure drop while the resistance of narrow cohesive layers to gas-powder flow is found to be relatively small. Gas-powder flow in moving beds of solid particles has been numerically investigated, under conditions related to the ironmaking blast furnace and high rate pulverized coal injection. A new correlation, which is formulated to describe static powder holdup in a moving packed bed, is incorporated into the previous mathematical model and applied to a description of gas-powder flow in a blast furnace. Compared with the results of fixed beds, the results show that the solids descent due to the consumption of ore, coke and unburnt char in various regions, together with the non-uniform structural distribution, significantly affects powder flow and accumulation in a blast furnace. Finally, liquid flow is simulated through force balance approach and numerical results are compared with the different liquid inlet distribution under the iron-making blast furnace conditions with gas flow. The results show that the effect of inlet distribution on liquid flow is significant in the upper part of coke region in BF and possible loading and dry zone can be numerically identified. Then, this part of work is incorporated to the developed gas-powder-solid modelling system to investigate the influence of liquid phase on other phases flow in the blast furnace although heat transfer and chemistry are not considered in the model.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blast furnaces</field><field name="subject">Multiphase flow.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of auxiliary transcription factors in the regulation of gene expression during sporulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</field><field name="creator">Lenardon, Megan Denise, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sporulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae includes the processes of meiosis and spore formation.  The genes involved in this developmental process are tightly regulated at the level of transcription to ensure that genes are expressed at the correct time and level.  The co-ordinated expression of middle sporulation genes is mediated by a key timing promoter element called the middle sporulation element (MSE).  While this element sets the timing of gene expression to middle sporulation, in some cases, the level of expression is mediated by cis-acting auxiliary promoter elements.  This study has addressed the role that auxiliary transcription factors play in fine-tuning of timing and level of expression of the MSE-regulated middle sporulation genes SPS18 and SPS19 and the mid-late sporulation genes DIT1 and DIT2.  The MSE*SPS18/19 was shown previously to set the timing of expression of SPS18 and SPS19 to middle sporulation.  In order to achieve the full level of meiotic activation, a novel bipartite auxiliary promoter element called the MAE (MSE-associated element) was required (Dalton, 2004).  This study has revealed that proteins bind to specific regions of the MAE motif during sporulation in vitro and has attempted to isolate the proteins by affinity chromatography and identify them by mass spectrometry. The timing of expression of DIT1 and DIT2 during sporulation was of particular interest since two MSE-like elements had been identified in the promoter of the these genes (Hepworth et al., 1995).  If these MSEs were functional, it was thought that auxiliary elements may delay expression of these genes until mid-late sporulation.  This study has shown that the MSE*NRE confers a normal middle sporulation pattern of expression on a reporter gene.  The DRE (DIT repressor element) previously identified by Bogengruber et al. (1998) was further characterised as an element that alters the level of expression conferred by an MSE without altering the timing.  Several proteins were shown to bind to specific regions of the DIT promoter surrounding the DRE motif in vitro, with a different set of proteins binding during vegetative growth and sporulation.  Attempts to isolate and identify these proteins by affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry are discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sporulation</field><field name="subject">Meiosis</field><field name="subject">Yeast</field><field name="subject">DIT1</field><field name="subject">Transcriptional Regulation</field><field name="subject">MSE</field><field name="subject">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</field><field name="subject">Gene expression.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formal Composition and Recovery Policies in Service-Based Business Processes</field><field name="creator">Hamadi, Rachid, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Process-based composition of Web services is emerging as a promising technology for the effective automation of integrated and collaborative applications.  As Web services are often autonomous and heterogeneous entities, coordinating their interactions to build complex processes is a difficult, error prone, and time-consuming task.  In addition, since Web services usually operate in dynamic and highly evolving environments, there is a need for supporting flexible and correct execution of integrated processes.  In this thesis, we propose a Petri net-based framework for formal composition and recovery policies in service-based business processes.  We first propose an algebra for composing Web services.  The formal semantics of this algebra is expressed in terms of Petri nets.  The use of a formal model allows the effective verification and analysis of properties, both within a service, such as termination and absence of deadlock, and between services, such as behavioral equivalences.  We also develop a top down approach for the correct (e.g., absence of deadlock and termination) composition of complex business processes.  The approach defines a set of refinement operators that guarantee correctness of the resulting business process nets at design time.  We then introduce Self-Adaptive Recovery Net (SARN), an extended Petri net model for specifying exceptional behavior in business processes.  SARN adapts the structure of the underlying Petri net at run time to handle exceptions while keeping the Petri net design simple and easy.  The proposed framework caters for the specification of high-level recovery policies that are incorporated either with a single task or a set of tasks, called a recovery region.  Finally, we propose a pattern-based approach to dynamically restructure SARN.  These patterns capture the ways past exceptions have been dealt with.  The objective is to continuously restructure recovery regions within the SARN model to minimize the impact of exception handling.  To illustrate the viability of the proposed composition and exception handling techniques, we have developed HiWorD (HIerarchical WORkflow Designer), a hierarchical Petri net-based business process modeling and simulation tool.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business Process</field><field name="subject">Web Service</field><field name="subject">Formal Modeling</field><field name="subject">Service Composition</field><field name="subject">Exception Handling</field><field name="subject">Organizational effectiveness</field><field name="subject">Business planning</field><field name="subject">Customer services.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The digger myth and Australian society : genesis, operation and review</field><field name="creator">Cummins, Philip S A, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">Through a theoretical framework of myth in genesis, operation and review, this thesis evaluates the relationship between Australian society and the myth of the digger, a tradition of Australian military manhood which originated in the First World War. The digger in genesis was a product of early twentieth century Australia???s need to establish for itself a distinct national identity. Deriving strongly from existing mythology of the bushman/pioneer and foster by the work of CEW Bean, it was quickly adopted by both governments and citizens anxious to promote the contributions of the Australian soldiers and to understand the relationships that these had with the emerging Australian society. The digger in operation from the First World War to the end of the Second World War to the early 1960s demonstrates the way in which Australian (enamoured of its simple and seemingly enduring qualities) Embedded the myth at the core of orthodox thinking about national Identity, despite its exclusivity and prescriptive, authoritarian control by conservative institutions. The era of the Vietnam War acted as a key review phase for the myth as its relevance was questioned significantly. Despite temporary rejection from many and fragmentation into a variety of icons, Australia???s brief flirtation with radical thinking did not last beyond the mid-1970s. A return to conservative values in the 1980s-1990s coincided with political reconciliation over the Vietnam War ??? by the mid-1990s, the digger myth had retained its position of relevance and importance within Australian culture, demonstrating its capacity to become adapted and appropriated to reflect an increasingly democratic and pluralistic society. The current prevailing version of the digger, the &amp;quotnew professional&amp;quot, demonstrates the parallel transition of Australian military culture. It co-exist with other representations, providing a scaffold through which individuals interact with it to develop their own understanding of the application of the digger myth to both their own lives and Australian society.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia.

However, current ensemble techniques for classification require both positive and negative data to produce a result that is both meaningful and useful. Negative data is, however, sometimes difficult, expensive or impossible to access. In this thesis a learning framework is described that has a very close relationship to boosting. Within this framework a method is described which bears remarkable similarities to boosting stumps and that does not rely on negative examples. This is surprising since learning from positive-only data has traditionally been difficult. An empirical methodology is described and deployed for testing positive-only learning systems using commonly available multiclass datasets to compare these learning systems with each other and with multiclass learning systems. Empirical results show that our positive-only boosting-like method learns, using stumps as a base learner and from positive data only, successfully, and in the process does not pay too heavy a price in accuracy compared to learners that have access to both positive and negative data. We also describe methods of using positive-only learners on multiclass learning tasks and vice versa and empirically demonstrate the superiority of our method of learning in a boosting-like fashion from positive-only data over a traditional multiclass learner converted to learn from positive-only data. Finally we examine some alternative frameworks, such as when additional unlabelled training examples are given.

This thesis examines the conjunction of social and political forces which contributed to the acceptance of the gay sauna by Sydney???s civic society. Two questions reveal this process:  1. How was an illegal and clandestine place for homosexuals, perceived as a threat to the moral standards of Sydney, transformed into an institutional entity, legally recognised as ???crucial???, and important within particular environs of this city? 2. How did the evolving public domain of gay saunas contribute to the development of gay culture in Sydney by fostering the opportunities for individual and collective expression of homosexual practices?  This study is contextualised within international and Australian studies of the sexualisation of urban spaces???such as Michel Foucault???s, Manuel Castells??? and Lawrence Knopp???s???and the role of the built environment in the development of sexual identity and sexual practices???such as Gayle Rubin???s, John Ricco???s, and Joel Brodsky???s. The first part of the thesis is an empirical analysis of development applications for gay saunas in Sydney between 1967 and 2000 which reveals the play of forces within state and local government, legislative processes, the homosexual community and broader civic stakeholders through which the gay sauna achieved acceptance in Sydney???s civic society. Two principal research approaches???documentary research and twenty in-depth interviews???were used in this first part. The second part of the thesis is an ethnography that uses twenty-nine in-depth interviews to provided a unique insight into the evolving public domain of Sydney???s gay saunas and how they fostered the experiences of gay men, allowing gay men to develop individual and collective sexual identities and practices.  This exploration of the interplay of built form, sexuality, civic governance, social identity and social action provide a sociological contribution which will also be of interest to gay studies, anthropology, architecture, geography and planning. Essential to an experience of the thesis is a concurrent reading of the Special Enclosures???a schematic chronology of Sydney gay saunas, plans of Sydney and architectural plans of its saunas.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gays</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">Gay clubs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The treatment of urinary incontinence : cost utility analysis and quality of life benefits</field><field name="creator">Foote, Andrew, , UNSW</field><field name="description">Aims: The aim of this thesis was to identify the most cost effective urogynaecological treatment from a range of five standard therapies of 217 female patients, and to test the hypothesis that the conservative treatment of urinary incontinence was more cost effective than surgical or pharmacological interventions, using the cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY)  as a common assessment. Methods: The first step in this process was to determine whether a generic cost effectiveness instrument, the York Quality of Life Questionnaire was sufficiently sensitive to allow its use in the field of urogynaecology.  The York Questionnaire was compared with several other quality of life questionnaires and outcome measures that have been previously utilised in urinary incontinence, and was found to be equally sensitive in detecting change in quality of life as a result of treatment. The next step was to measure the costs required to produce this change in quality of life and to calculate the QALY's for five urogynaecological treatments in three prospective trials comprising of: a randomised trial of Nurse Continence Advisor versus Urogynaecologist conservative treatment of urinary incontinence (n=143), a prospective trial of laparoscopic versus open colposuspension (n=62), and the pharmacological treatment of detrusor instability (n=12).  Costs assessed included consultation fees, investigations, theatre costs, hospital stay, patient time off work &amp; travel expenses,  and reduction in protective pad costs. Results: The cost/QALY for 5 years as a result of each of the five treatments varied from $28,009 for the Nurse Continence Advisor conservative treatment to $134,069 for the open colposuspension treatment. Conclusions: This finding suggests that the conservative treatment of urinary incontinence is the most cost effective, and should be utilised as the first form of treatment. As a consequence, financial resources would be more efficiently utilised in the conservative treatment of urinary incontinence, such as increasing the availability of services offered by Nurse Continence Advisors and physiotherapists.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urinary incontinence</field><field name="subject">quality of life</field><field name="subject">cost effectiveness</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk management in superannuation</field><field name="creator">Thorp, Susan Jane, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to investigate how members of Australian superannuation funds can manage risks arising from uncertain security returns and unpredictable mortality so as to ensure a steady income stream during retirement. In chapter 2 we note that the proportion of superannuation assets invested in foreign assets has increased over the past two decades, exposing investors to currency risk. Surveys of superannuation funds verify that most international bond holdings, but not equity holdings, have been hedged for currency risk. We test the mean-variance efficiency of this practice against two alternative hedging strategies: a conventional forward hedge and a selective hedge conditioned on the domestic-foreign interest differential. Implementing optimal hedging results in portfolios whose returns stochastically dominate portfolios constructed under restricted equity hedging, according to our new adaptation of Barrett-Donald (2003) tests. Selective hedging works best for equities and conventional hedging for bonds. Chapter 3 applies a discrete-time Merton (1971) model to questions of optimal decumulation and asset allocation for self-funded retirees drawing down lump-sum retirement benefits. Risk management is taken to revolve around protecting a pre-specified minimum consumption stream. Risk tolerances and lifetimes are allowed to span a range of possibilities. In the case of an agent living to age 90, ideal investment in equity-type assets increases gradually from 27-43 % over remaining life. This is much lower than the 55-60% observed among retirees. Conservative investment strategies are needed to meet consumption goals over long lifetimes.  Milevsky and Young (2002, 2003) attribute the reluctance to voluntarily annuitise to a valuable real option to delay annuitisation (RODA). Chapter 4 extends the RODA analysis to the case of HARA preferences. A formula for the optimal timing of annuitisation is derived from the solution to a dynamic stochastic consumption and investment problem with uncertain lifetime. The effect of introducing a consumption floor is to reduce the delay before annuity purchase. As in the CRRA case, delayed annuitisation is associated with optimistic predictions of the Sharpe ratio and divergence between annuity purchaser and provider predictions of mortality.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">superannuation</field><field name="subject">pensions</field><field name="subject">HARA utility</field><field name="subject">currency hedging</field><field name="subject">annuitisation</field><field name="subject">Pension trusts</field><field name="subject">Risk management.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20858</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Software group reviews and the impact of procedural roles on defect detection performance</field><field name="creator">Land, Lesley Pek Wee, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Software reviews (inspections) have received widespread attention for ensuring the quality of software, by finding and repairing defects in software products. A typical review process consists of two stages critical for defect detection: individual review followed by group review. This thesis addresses two attributes to improve our understanding of the task model: (1) the need for review meetings, and (2) the use of roles in meetings. The controversy of review meeting effectiveness has been consistently raised in the literature. Proponents maintain that the review meeting is the crux of the review process, resulting in group synergism and qualitative benefits (e.g. user satisfaction). Opponents argue that against meetings because the costs of organising and conducting them are high, and there is no net meeting gain. The persistence of these diverse views is the main motivation behind this thesis. Although commonly prescribed in meetings, roles have not yet been empirically validated. Three procedural roles (moderator, reader, recorder) were considered. A conceptual framework on software reviews was developed, from which main research questions were identified. Two experiments were conducted. Review performance was operationalised in terms of true defects and false positives. The review product was COBOL code. The results indicated that in terms of true defects, group reviews outperformed the average individual but not nominal group reviews (aggregate of individual reviews). However, groups have the ability to filter false positives from the individuals' findings. Roles provided limited benefits in improving group reviews. Their main function is to reduce process loss, by encouraging systematic consideration of the individuals' findings. When two or more reviewers find a defect during individual reviews, it is likely to be carried through to the meeting (plurality effect). Groups employing roles reported more 'new' false positives (not identified from preparation) than groups without roles. Overall, subjects' ability at the defect detection was low. This thesis suggests that reading technologies may be helpful for improving reviewer performance. The inclusion of an author role may also reduce the level of false positive detection. The results have implications on the design and support of the software review process.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Software engineering</field><field name="subject">Quality control</field><field name="subject">Computer software</field><field name="subject">Group problem solving</field><field name="subject">Evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21838</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The negative chargeability of clays</field><field name="creator">Brandes, Ian Marcus, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Coastal clay deposits are an increasingly important focus of environmental and geotechnical studies, and to date, geophysical techniques for mapping them have almost exclusively relied on bulk conductivity measurements. However, direct correlation of bulk conductivity data is difficult, as it is a non-unique parameter. A potential alternative geophysical mapping tool is the complex conductivity technique, where both in-phase and out-of-phase conductivity are measured concurrently. Using similar principles, the induced polarisation field technique measures the charge polarisation parameter chargeability. Studies that utilise these techniques have almost exclusively concentrated on the charge polarisation properties of sediments with low clay contents, and these sediments have intuitively credible positive chargeability values. However, the few studies that include high-clay-content sediments ??? like those encountered in coastal clay deposits ??? have often reported negative chargeabilities. No mechanism has been presented that accounts for this effect. Similar negative chargeability effects have been noted in other sciences, but often remain unexplained. Negative chargeability is shown here to be a non-linear property of clay gels ??? unique to sediments with bulk membrane properties and a potential new clay mapping parameter. A new clay polarisation model is presented which accounts for negative chargeability. Clay sediments are considered as a clay gel membrane, as opposed to traditional models ??? of clay zones within a solid substrate. In the revised model, non-linear ionic gradients occur within the sample, due to the bulk membrane properties of clay gels. Charge dispersion is described in terms of anomalous diffusion Warburg impedances, which create currents in the opposite sense to the applied potential. Negative chargeability is then a unique feature of sediments with bulk membrane properties. Laboratory electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data are presented. The experimental data covers a variety of clay types at a variety of water contents. For pure clay samples, negative chargeability is shown to occur when the clay???s water content is such that it is in a gel state. The threshold water content is shown to be a function of the clay???s liquid limit. This trend is more complicated for natural clays. Field measurements of negative chargeability are presented. The Conductivity Cone Penetrometer (CCPT) is utilised as a chargeability-logging tool at a field site at Hexham, New South Wales. In the first study of its kind, negative chargeability CCPT logging is shown to be effective in mapping a coastal clay deposit.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clays</field><field name="subject">Analysis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21847</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Boron tribromide sourced boron diffusions for silicon solar cells</field><field name="creator">Slade, Alexander Mason, Electrical Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis undertakes the development, characterization and optimization of boron diffusion for silicon solar cells.  Heavy diffusions (sheet resistance &lt; 40 Ohm/square) to form a back surface field, and light diffusions (sheet resistance &gt; 100 Ohm/square) to form oxide-passivated emitters were developed.  Test structures and solar cells were fabricated to assess uniformity, lifetime and recombination effects due to the light and heavy boron diffusions. It was found that the growth of a thin ~200 ??, thermal oxide, during stabilization ??? immediately prior to the boron diffusion - was required to maintain high lifetime and reduce surface recombination (reducing the emitter saturation current density) for all boron diffusions.  The heavy boron diffusion process was incorporated into the single side buried contact solar cell processing sequence.  The solar cells fabricated had both boron diffused and Al/Si alloyed P+ regions for comparison.  This research conclusively showed that boron diffused solar cells had significantly higher open circuit voltage compared to Al/Si alloyed devices.  Fabrication of n-type solar cells, and their subsequent characterization by overlayed secondary electron image and the electron beam induced current map showed that the Al/Si alloy varied in depth from 5 to 25 micrometers deep. Methodology and characterization for light, oxide-passivated boron diffusions are also presented.  This study yielded boron diffused emitters (sheet resistance &gt; 100 Ohm/square) with low emitter saturation current.  It was observed that this was possible only when the thermal oxidation after the boron diffusion was minimal, less than 1,000 ??.  This was due to the segregation effect of boron with oxide, decreasing the surface concentration that in turn decreased the electric field repulsion of electrons from the surface.  Device modelling of n-type solar cells is presented where the parameters of the modelling include the results of the light, oxide-passivated boron diffusions.  This modelling shows n-type-base material with light oxide-passivated boron diffusion has higher potential conversion efficiency than forming a solar cell from phosphorous diffused p-type material.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">boron diffusion</field><field name="subject">BBr3</field><field name="subject">solar cell</field><field name="subject">Boron</field><field name="subject">Solar cells.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21850</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fatigue crack propagation in functionally graded materials</field><field name="creator">Tilbrook, Matthew Thomas, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Propagation of cracks in functionally graded materials (FGMs) under cyclic loading was investigated via experiments and finite element (FE) analysis. Alumina-epoxy composites with an interpenetrating-network structure and tailored spatial variation in composition were produced via a multi-step infiltration technique. Compressed polyurethane foam was infiltrated with alumina slip. After foam burn-out and sintering, epoxy was infiltrated into the porous alumina body. Non-graded specimens with a range of compositions were produced, and elastic properties and fatigue behaviour were characterised. An increase in crack propagation resistance under cyclic loading was quantified via a novel analytical approach.  A simulation platform was developed with the commercial FE package ANSYS. Material gradient was applied via nodal temperature definitions. Stress intensity factors were calculated from nodal displacements near the crack-tip. Deflection criteria were compared and the local symmetry criterion provided the most accurate and efficient predictions. An automated mesh-redefinition algorithm enabled incremental simulation of crack propagation. Effects of gradient and crack-geometry parameters on crack-tip stresses were investigated, along with influences of crack-shape, crack-bridging, residual stresses and plasticity. The model provided predictions and data analysis for experimental specimens. Fatigue cracks in graded specimens deflected due to elastic property mismatch, concordant with FE predictions. In other FGMs, thermal or plastic properties may dominate deflection behaviour. Weaker step-interfaces influenced crack paths in some specimens; otherwise effects of toughness variation and gradient steps on crack path were negligible. Crack shape has an influence, but this is secondary to that of elastic gradient. Cracks in FGM specimens initially experienced increase in fatigue resistance with crack-extension followed by sudden decreases at step-interfaces. Bridging had a notable effect on crack propagation resistance but not on crack path. Similarly, crack paths did not differ between monotonic and cyclic loading, although crack-extension effects did. Recommendations for analysis and optimisation strategies for other FGM systems are given. Experimental characterization of FGMs is important, rather than relying on theoretical models. Opportunities for optimization of graded structures are limited by the properties of the constituent materials and resultant general crack deflection behaviour.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Functionally graded materials (FGMs)</field><field name="subject">composites</field><field name="subject">fracture</field><field name="subject">fatigue</field><field name="subject">finite element analysis</field><field name="subject">R-curve</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular interactions and chirality</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Tuong Vi, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">- Alicyclic diols can hydrogen bond in many different ways and yield most interesting structures. In this thesis, eight C2-symmetric diols 48-50, 78, 79 and 81-83 were synthesized and their crystal structures were determined. No less than seven of these show unusual solid state behaviour: 48 and 78 are inclusion hosts; 49, 50 and 78 form doubly-stranded hydrogen-bonded ladder structures, where there is a strong preference for each strand to be homochiral; 78, 81 and 82 undergo self-resolution during recrystallization; and 83 forms chirally pure crystals (but the material is still racemic). - One of the favourable supramolecular synthons for hydroxy compounds is the (O-H)6 cycle of hydrogen bonds. When this cycle is formed by a racemic compound, its enantiomers alternate down-up-down etc. around the cycle. No case of an (O-H)6 cycle involving chirally pure hydroxy compounds is known. These observations indicate a strong preference for the (O-H)6 cycle being constructed from achiral or racemic molecules rather than from chirally pure hydroxyl compounds. Racemic (??)-48 and (??)-92 which are already known to form (O-H)6 cycles in the solid state were prepared in chirally pure form and their X-ray crystal structures determined. No (O-H)6 cycles were observed for these homochiral diols. These findings confirm that the (O-H)6 motif occurs only for achiral or racemic compounds. - Similarly, the edge-to-edge eight-membered aryl C-H???N dimer involves either achiral molecules or those of opposite chirality. No chirally pure dimers of this type are reported. Racemic compounds 42-44 that are known to pack using the C-H???N dimer were synthesized in chirally pure form. No edge-to-edge eight-membered aryl C-H???N dimers were formed in the solid state. Hence this supramolecular synthon is only favoured for achiral or racemic compounds only. - Other major conclusions are that the cause of self-resolution is due to packing energy. In some cases it is likely that solvent choice, or solvent plus temperature selection, can be used to control self-resolution.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chirality</field><field name="subject">Molecular dynamics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21891</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Decision by Design - Decision Support for Antibiotic Prescribing in Critical Care</field><field name="creator">Sintchenko, Vitali, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Decision support systems (DSS) are traditionally designed to optimise the outcomes of a decision. This thesis explores how DSS design can also be driven by the optimisation of the decision process leading to the decision, and how it may enhance the human uptake and use of DSS. It identifies which tasks could be simplified by decision support, and how to build DSS that are likely to be readily adopted and so improve decision outcomes. It tests the hypotheses that: (a) The analysis of specific process attributes of a given clinical decision task, as well as the information needs of its users, improves the design of DSS and enhances systems?impact and acceptance. (b) The complexity of the decision task is the key process attribute that, in conjunction with the information seeking of users, shapes the outcome of the design process. The work is applied to the domain of antibiotic prescribing in critical care. To explore the first hypothesis, the key attributes of prescribing decisions associated with specific prescribing subtasks and different decision-makers and decision contexts are identified and then analysed. Based on our findings, an information-processing model of decision support for an antibiotic-prescribing task is proposed. The second hypothesis is addressed by applying and comparing metrics for decision complexity including minimum message length, cognitive effort assessment and clinical algorithm structure analysis to the prescribing task. A framework is developed to select clinical decision tasks that may benefit from automation, by characterizing decision support as a process of complexity reduction for users, and these ideas are tested in the context of antibiotic prescribing for ventilator-associated pneumonia. The hypotheses are then tested by applying the task complexity framework to the design of a DSS for antibiotic prescribing in critical care. A web-based experiment and a clinical trial of the DSS are described, both of which study the acceptability and effectiveness of the system and verify the usefulness of the design framework. Specifically, in a before-after controlled trial, with no difference in patient mortality or severity of presentation between the two periods, the use of the DSS was associated with statistically significant improvements in patient outcomes and a reduction in antibiotic usage. The length of stay and total consumption of antibiotics decreased respectively from 7.15 to 6.22 days (P=0.02) and from 1767 to 1458 defined daily doses/1000 patient days (P=0.04). The introduction of a hand-held computer-based DSS was associated with less administration of ???broad-spectrum?antibiotics. The relative impact of the uptake of the DSS on the prescribing quality was quantified. Clinicians chose to use guidelines for one third, and pathology data or the DSS for about two thirds of cases for which they were available to assist their prescribing decisions. When used, the DSS plus pathology data improved the agreement of decisions with those of an expert panel - from 65% to 97% (P=0.002). The impact of the DSS was more significant on prescribing decisions of higher complexity. The level of decision complexity appeared to affect the choice of decision support type. Prescribing guidelines were accessed more often for lower complexity decisions, whereas the infection risk DSS plus pathology data were preferred for decisions of higher complexity. The need for measurement of the effectiveness of a DSS in improving decisions, as well as their likely rate of adoption in the clinical environment, was demonstrated. The thesis concludes with a proposal to apply the framework described to the modelling of the DSS adoption and to include task complexity and user information seeking as determinants of the design and evaluation of clinical DSS.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antibiotics</field><field name="subject">Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Critical care medicine.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21894</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tracers and indicators of estuarine nutrients</field><field name="creator">Moore, Stephanie Kay, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Three novel methods were examined to assess the effects of nutrient enrichment in three sub-tropical east Australian estuaries with differing levels of catchment disturbance. The Manning and Wallamba River catchments are 8927 and 500 km2 respectively and support intensive livestock agriculture and some residential development, whereas the smaller Wallingat River catchment is 185 km2 and is mostly forested. The Wallamba and Wallingat Rivers flow into Wallis Lake, which was the site of an environmental crisis in 1997 when the consumption of sewage-contaminated locally grown oysters caused an outbreak of Hepatitis A. This study contributes valuable and extensive water quality data to assess rehabilitative works in Wallis Lake, and in other estuaries, to reduce the input of nutrients such as sewage. The importance of various sources, loads and sinks and the dispersion and assimilation of nutrients were quantified and compared for each estuary. An ecological model coupled with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic box model revealed that nearly all of the nitrogen inputs to the modified Wallamba River entered as runoff from the intensively livestock farmed upper catchment. In contrast, in the forested Wallingat River nitrogen was generated internally from anoxic sediments and was also longitudinally dispersed upstream from the junction with the modified Coolongolook River. Bloom conditions of up to 59 mg m-3 were observed in the Wallamba River between 7 and 11 days after the storms, but in spite of high concentrations of biologically available nitrogen in the forested Wallingat River, phytoplankton biomass was low due to phosphate limitation. Longitudinal dispersion could not counter phytoplankton growth in the modified Wallamba River, in spite of large increases in river flow. Estimates of grazing pressure by the pygmy mussel, Xenostrobus securis, demonstrate that it could contribute up to half of the phytoplankton loss. The inter-tidal mangrove pneumatophore habitat of X. securis allows filtering of the upper water column from the lateral boundaries in a vertically stratified water column, exerting top-down control on phytoplankton biomass.  The optical plankton counter (OPC) can provide an in situ, rapid assessment of zooplankton productivity over large temporal and spatial scales from the size distribution of zooplankton. High concentrations of sub-resolved particles, including suspended detritus, have hampered the use of the in situ OPC in estuaries. Up to 58 counts L-1 due to the coincidence of sub-resolved particles passing through 100 ??m mesh were detected by the laboratory OPC in Manning, Wallamba and Wallingat River water samples. The influence of these erroneous counts on in situ OPC measurements was assessed by comparison with measurements of simultaneously collected net zooplankton measured using the laboratory OPC. In situ OPC measurements of total zooplankton abundance could be corrected for erroneous counts of sub-resolved particles using laboratory OPC measurements of 100 ??m mesh filtered water samples from the same site, but estimates had large associated error and information on the size structure of the zooplankton community is sacrificed. In contrast to expected relationships, no meaningful or significant correlations were found between the number or biomass of sub-resolved particles and in situ light attenuance. Laboratory OPC measurements of net zooplankton in each estuary revealed that the modified Manning and Wallamba Rivers supported a greater biomass of zooplankton compared to the forested Wallingat River. The normalised biomass size spectra of net zooplankton responded to both production of small particles and predation and loss of large particles.  The effect of catchment disturbance on the nitrogen and carbon stable isotope ratios (??15N and ??13C) of X. securis was investigated in the three estuaries. Manning and Wallamba River mussels were enriched in ??15N by an average of 3.2??? and 1.5??? respectively compared to mussels from the forested Wallingat River. The isotope values of particulate organic matter showed a similar pattern to mussels, indicating a direct link between them within each estuary. A multiple regression model of mussel ??15N using the fractions of land used for livestock agriculture and residential development within 5 km zones from river networks to a distance equivalent to a tidal ellipse from sites explained 67% of the variation in mussel ??15N with 95% of the differences lying within 1.6??? of observed values. Increasing fractions of land used for livestock agriculture in the regression equation depleted estimated mussel ??15N indicating the use of cow manure as a nutrient source with a value of 2.0???. Increasing fractions of land used for residential development enriched estimated mussel ??15N, indicating the use of human-derived waste with a value of 20.8???.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Estuarine ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21993</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of dissenting opinions upon the development of Australian constitutional law</field><field name="creator">Lynch, Andrew, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to assess the role played by disagreement in the High Court???s constitutional law decisions. It does so firstly by considering the theoretical arguments in favour of allowing expression of dissent and those which urge judicial restraint and observance of precedential values. The tensions between change and conformity, and also the individual and institutional aspects of adjudication, intersect when the Court divides. The complex nature of disagreement on a multimember judicial body is further examined in the context of devising an empirical methodology for the quantification of dissent on the High Court. The thesis selects a period of a little over twenty years for detailed examination. Within that timeframe, it measures the prevalence and nature of disagreement amongst the Justices of the Court, with particular emphasis upon constitutional cases. From these results, various streams of opinion are examined for subsequent significance. In particular, the thesis contrasts the practice of persistent dissent from the Court???s approach to an issue, with those occasions when a minority Justice yields to the demands of stare decisis. The impact of dissent upon the development of the Court???s constitutional interpretation is evaluated. Although the study finds that direct reversals in the law in favour of an earlier dissent occur very rarely, it argues that dissents may still exercise a powerful influence on the Court???s pronouncements. The contribution which minority opinions make to judicial deliberation is to inevitably alter the context of the Court???s decision. Consideration of two specific case studies illustrates that this may result in the law taking a more moderate path or may actually lead to greater efforts by a majority to strengthen the cogency of its approach. In either scenario, dissent plays a far more subtle role than suggested by the myth of a ???Great Dissenter??? and the dramatic redemption of his or her lone opinions. To only assess the value of dissenting judgments against that standard is to fail to appreciate the true nature of their influence in many cases and their importance to the work of the High Court.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">High Court</field><field name="subject">Dissenting opinions</field><field name="subject">Constitutional law</field><field name="subject">Cases.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21996</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parameter identification for vector contolled induction motor drives using artificial neural networks and fuzzy principles</field><field name="creator">Karanayil, Baburaj, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses, develops and implements a very fast on-line parameter identification algorithm for both rotor and stator resistances of a rotor flux oriented induction motor drive, with the best possible convergence results using artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic systems. The thesis focuses mainly on identifying the rotor resistance, which is the most critical parameter for RFOC. Limitations of PI and fuzzy logic based estimators were identified. Artificial neural network based estimators were found to track the rotor and stator resistances of the drive accurately and fast. The rotor flux of the induction motor estimated with a classical voltage model was the key input of the rotor resistance estimator. Because, pure digital integrators were unable to play this role, an alternative rotor flux synthesizer using a programmable cascaded filter was developed. This rotor flux synthesizer has been used for all of the resistance estimators. It was found that the error in rotor resistance estimation using an ANN was contributed to by error in the stator resistance (caused by motor heating). Several stator resistance estimators using the stator current measurements were developed. The limitations of a PI and a fuzzy estimator for stator resistance estimation were also established. A new stator resistance identifier using an ANN was found to be much superior to the PI and fuzzy estimators, both in terms of dynamic estimation times and convergence problems. The rotor resistance estimator developed for this thesis used a feedforward neural network and the stator resistance estimator used a recurrent neural network.  Both networks exhibited excellent learning capabilities; the stator resistance estimator network was very fast as it had a feedback input. A speed estimator was also developed with the state estimation principles, with the updated motor parameters supplied by the ANN estimators. Analysis for speed sensorless operation has shown that the stator and rotor resistances could be updated on-line.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">induction motor drives</field><field name="subject">vector control</field><field name="subject">parameter identification</field><field name="subject">artificial neural networks</field><field name="subject">fuzzy logic</field><field name="subject">Electric motors</field><field name="subject">Induction</field><field name="subject">Neural networks (Computer science)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21999</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modulation of T cell responses by N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone</field><field name="creator">Ritchie, Adam John, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which causes severe secondary infections in immunocompromised patients, virulence factor expression is regulated by quorum sensing signal molecules known as acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs). One of the major AHLs produced by P. aeruginosa, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL), has also been shown to alter the function of a range of mammalian cells. The goals of experiments reported in this thesis were to use murine models to investigate the effects of in vivo exposure to OdDHL on TH responses, define the direct effects of OdDHL on TH cells and to explore the mechanism by which OdDHL alters the function of TH cells. It was found that in vivo exposure to OdDHL led to changes in cytokine and antibody subclass production indicative of a shift towards the underlying TH bias of the mouse strain studied. Such shifts may play a role in infections with P. aeruginosa, as strong TH1 or TH2 responses have been associated with worsening prognosis for the host, while more balanced responses have been associated with decreases in both infection and pathology. These results suggest that treatments targeting the immunomodulatory activities of OdDHL may be of benefit in the clinical setting in the future. Direct analysis of TH cells in defined in vitro systems revealed that exposure to OdDHL led to uniform decreases in cytokine production and proliferation. These decreases in cytokine production were found to be the result of OdDHL acting on both TH cells and the antigen presenting cells (APCs) that activate them, and only occurred when cells were exposed to OdDHL within 4 hours of stimulation. These findings suggest that OdDHL is acting on a molecular target common to several cells types, and that in TH cells and APCs, this target is involved in the early stages of TH cell activation. Experiments in which T cells were activated with mitogens that bypass the cell membrane revealed that OdDHL is not acting on the cell membrane or membrane-associated activation factors, suggesting that OdDHL is instead inhibiting TH cell function through interactions with one or more intracellular signalling molecules.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">immunomodulation</field><field name="subject">psuedomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">T cell</field><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">Lactones</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'The centre cannot hold': resistance, accommodation and control in three Australian call centres</field><field name="creator">Barnes, Alison Kate, School of Industrial Relations &amp; Organisational Behaviour, UNSW</field><field name="description">Drawing upon case studies of three organisations operating six call centres in Australia, this thesis explores the manifestations and interplay of employee resistance and accommodation in response to five facets of employer control: electronic monitoring; repetitious work; emotional control; the built environment; and workplace flexibility.  Accommodation refers to the ways workers protect themselves from and adapt to the pressures that make up their day-to-day experiences of work. Accommodation, unlike resistance, which implies opposition to control, may superficially resemble consent to control. I argue that resistance and accommodation are not polar opposites; rather they are both reflections of the conflict and tensions that lie at the heart of the employment relationship.  At the study sites, employees utilised resistance and accommodation both separately and concurrently. An explanation of these seemingly contradictory responses and of the links among accommodation individual resistance and collective resistance lies in the concept of ???self???. In this thesis, ???self??? refers to workers??? perceptions of fairness, dignity and autonomy. I examine how these notions frame worker discontent and promote employee solidarity. ???Everyday resistance???, a concept first developed by Scott (1985) in relation to peasant struggles, is employed to highlight the existence of subterranean struggles in workplaces that otherwise appear to be harmonious. At the study sites, everyday resistance was a multi-faceted, widely employed strategy whose strength lay primarily in its immediate impact. There was, however, no necessary sequential development from accommodation, through everyday resistance to overt, formal forms of conflict. What was evident was that multiple responses to employer control could co-exist and inhibit or promote one another. But it was through organised collective resistance that more formalised gains were made and widely held grievances addressed.  I suggest that, although everyday resistance may lay the groundwork for more formal struggles, one should not conclude that traditional collective resistance is ???genuine??? resistance and everyday resistance is simply a second-best prelude to it. Although conflict is always present, its intensity differs. If we are to understand the complexity of worker responses to managerial control, we need to expand the theoretical frameworks within which we analyse and interpret conflict.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">call centres</field><field name="subject">call centers</field><field name="subject">labour process</field><field name="subject">labor process</field><field name="subject">resistance</field><field name="subject">accommodation</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">repetitious work</field><field name="subject">customer service</field><field name="subject">built environment</field><field name="subject">flexibility</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Employees</field><field name="subject">Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Case studies</field><field name="subject">Employee attitude surveys</field><field name="subject">Employee morale</field><field name="subject">Work environment</field><field name="subject">Control</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="subject">Electronic monitoring in workplace</field><field name="subject">Quality of work life</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">T cell transcriptomes: uncovering the mechanisms for T cell effector function through gene profiling</field><field name="creator">Chtanova, Tatyana, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">T cells are at the heart of the adaptive immune response. They mediate many important immunological processes that provide protection against viruses, bacteria and other pathogens. The aim of the work described in this thesis was to use gene expression profiling to gain insights into different aspects of T cell biology. In particular we wanted to examine the mechanisms and identify the genes that underlie T cell effector function.  IFN-g-producing Th1 cells are a major effector subset that protects against intracellular pathogens, while Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 and mediate protection against large extracellular pathogens. Microarray profiling of gene expression in mouse and human Th1 and Th2 cells, as well as mouse Tc1 and Tc2 cells, identified a number of novel markers of these T cells which may have important roles in T cell differentiation/function. We found that T cell type, host species and differentiation conditions significantly influenced gene expression profiles generated during T cell polarization. Providing help to B cells for antibody production is the major function of the third effector subset of CD4+ T cells termed T follicular homing or TFH cells. Relatively little is known about the generation of these cells, and the mechanisms of their effector function. Using oligonucleotide microarrays we identified a TFH-specific gene expression signature, which included many novel genes which will undoubtedly enable better identification and characterization of this novel subset. A comprehensive study profiling all the major leukocyte subsets revealed their distinct gene expression signatures and numerous leukocyte subset specific genes. A detailed examination of most major T cell subsets identified distinguishing features of each subset together with gene expression changes associated with T cell activation and exposure to cell culture conditions. In addition, we described a distinctive transcriptional profile for gd T cells and examined the differences between central and effector memory T cells. We also showed that specific gene expression signatures provide a powerful tool for subset classification. Taken together this work provides important insights into T cell differentiation and effector function, and presents a basis for future work examining numerous novel genes relevant to T cell biology.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">microarrays</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the antecedents and consequences of career decidedness and comfort</field><field name="creator">Earl, Joanne K., Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines some of the antecedents and consequences of career decision status (i.e., being decided about and comfortable with career decisions). Antecedents investigated included: age, university level, work experience (quality and quantity), and accuracy of self-ratings.  Work outcomes (as measured by job satisfaction, organisational commitment and performance) were the consequences of career decision status explored in this thesis. When the antecedents of age, university level and quantity of work experience were reviewed cross-sectionally all contributed to career decision status. It was concluded that age best predicted decidedness suggesting that the development of career decision status is part of a maturation process.  Volume measured by the number of hours worked rather than pattern of work (i.e., full-time vs. part-time vs. casual) determined variability in scores on the career measures. Breadth of work experience (measured by number of jobs and employers) did not influence career decision status.  When explored longitudinally it was found that decidedness decreased after participating in the work force and work experience programs. Quality rather than quantity of work experience was a more significant predictor of decidedness.  Work experience and graduate programs should focus on the quality of experience provided, rather than quantity of time spent, if the purpose is to contribute to career decision making. In comparing the self-ratings of decided and undecided students it was found that decided students were no more perceptive about their capabilities than those who were undecided.  This suggests that self-rating measures should be used in conjunction with objective measures if this information is to be used for the purpose of vocational assessments, even when students claim to be decided about their career choice. Some evidence exists to suggest that students rating themselves higher on comfort with career decisions were more capable of matching their career interests with job advertisements rather than on occupational titles alone.  Comfort levels in career decision making may have an important role in evaluating available opportunities. In examining the relationship between work outcomes and career decision status in a longitudinal design it was concluded that job satisfaction promotes career comfort, decidedness predicts organisational commitment and this relationship is moderated by met expectations, and that neither being decided or comfortable predicts performance. Some evidence was found to suggest that those employees claiming high self-clarity (i.e., knowledge of their abilities, skills, and personality) were rated as higher performers. It may be beneficial for organisations to direct their efforts towards promoting comfort by providing quality work experience, and helping employees to clarify their strengths in terms of interests, abilities and attributes. It was concluded that career decidedness is still relevant to a contemporary work environment, but that comfort with career decisions has the potential for far greater impact.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Career development</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A pattern based approach for the architectural design of e-business applications</field><field name="creator">Dabous, Feras Taleb  Abdel Rahman, School of Information Systems Technology &amp; Management, UNSW</field><field name="description">With the widespread use of the Internet and its associated technologies, enterprises have to evolve in the way they are conducting business. 'e-business applications' refer to a new class of distributed applications that involves the Internet as a communication platform. Each e-business application supports the full automation of business processes that can span across multiple enterprises.  For a given application domain that involves e-business application development, a number of design decisions that best fullfil stakeholders requirements have to be made. One important issue is the reuse of functionality which exists within legacy systems that can belong to one or more enterprises within the same domain. Most existing design approaches are inadequate in supporting the exploration of all design combinations. Moreover, there is little work on how to identify the best design decisions systematically for a given application domain. In this thesis we present a pattern-based approach that addresses the architectural design of e-business applications. We identify a number of architectural patterns whose instantiation on a given design problem correspond to different architectural design alternatives. We also identify models that enable the estimation of quality attributes for such alternatives. Then we investigate and utilise methods to select the best pattern for a given design problem. We also describe the process of generating the alternative architectures, estimating their qualities, and then ranking them with respect to any quality attribute or a combination of quality attributes.  We validate this approach on a real life case study in the area of capital markets. The case study concerns realistic e-business applications that rely on existing legacy applications. The validation exercise has produced predictions which have been compared with actual design decisions that have been made. The thesis also proposes a framework for the systematic identification of architectural patterns. An additional set of architectural patterns and their impact on the case study are discussed.

I use a range of experimental techniques to investigate these questions including: comparisons of feral populations of guppies (Chapter Two), laboratory experiments that manipulate the social (sex ratio, density; Chapters Three and Four) and physical (water current; Chapter Five) environment in which guppies live, genetic paternity analysis and multivariate selection analysis (Chapter Four). I also conduct longitudinal studies of house crickets that estimate the net fitness consequences (Chapter Six) and indirect effects (Chapter Six and Seven) of mating with attractive males. My results demonstrate that the physical and social environment of individuals are important in determining the costliness of both sexual display and mate choice, and thus influence the mating behaviour of males and females. These differences in mating behaviour are often thought to lead to differences in sexual selection on males. My study of the effects of operational sex ratio and density on multivariate sexual selection, however, indicates that differences in behaviour may not necessarily translate into differences in selection. In contrast to predictions of recent theory, my results also indicate that although there are many costs to being choosy and to mating with attractive males, these may be outweighed by indirect benefits. Hence, despite direct costs of choice, mate choice may evolve via indirect benefits to females. Indirect benefits that are often neglected in sexual selection studies, that I show to be important in determining the net fitness of mating with attractive males, include the attractiveness of sons and the mate choice decisions of daughters. These results highlight the importance of examining the consequences of mate choice over multiple generations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mate selection</field><field name="subject">sexual selection in animals</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical investigation of client perceived value for professional B2B services in an international context</field><field name="creator">La, Vinh Quang, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In today???s highly competitive business environment, client perceived value has become increasingly important to practitioners and business researchers as it is believed to be central to client decision-making, satisfaction and client retention. However, there are few insights as to what constitutes client perceived value and what are its antecedents, especially in the context of international, professional business-to-business (B2B) services. This study thus addressed two key questions: (i) what are the antecedents of client perceived value in an international, professional B2B service setting?; and (ii) how do these determinants influence client perceived performance and value under different contingency conditions (e.g., perceptions of country-oforigin (COO) and client experience)? The research was undertaken in two phases: Phase 1 included a literature review covering services marketing, international marketing, resource-based theory, contingency theory as well as an exploratory research amongst eight dyadic case studies. The objectives were to identify the key variables that contribute to client perceived performance and value; to fine tune the key constructs adopted from the literature; and to verify the linkage between the resource-based view (RBV) of a firm and client perceived value. By drawing on the theories mentioned above, and the results from the exploratory research, a conceptual model and a series of hypotheses were developed. The data used to test the model in Phase 2 was collected from 218 client firms in both Malaysia and Thailand. The data was collected through a mail survey with a net response rate of 32.9%, and was analysed via structural equation modelling, regression analysis and subgroup analysis. The results show that the key antecedents of perceived performance which in turn drives client value, included technical skills, customer orientation, innovation and firm reputation. The findings also suggest that COO moderates the relationships between these antecedents and perceived performance, while client experience moderates the association between perceived performance and value. The results provide a better understanding of value perceived by the B2B clients in an international setting. The academic contributions of this thesis are: the linkage of RBV and the services paradigm in an international context; the understanding of client perceived value and its antecedents; and the establishment of metric equivalence of measures employed across two countries (Malaysia and Thailand). Finally, the managerial contributions include guidance for exporting firms in terms of resource allocation to achieve competitive advantage; utilising the COO effect in promotion; and managing client value perceptions in international markets.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">international business enterprises</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of bone defect models in immunodeficient animals</field><field name="creator">Gan, Jade Ho Yue, School of Biomedical Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Bone defects resulting from non-unions, fractures, significant revision joint replacements, tumour resection and osteolysis present a clinical problem. While autografts are considered the gold standard, ubiquitous use of this reparative technique is limited by graft supply and site morbidity. Recent progresses in tissue engineering using stem cells, bone enhancing molecules and gene therapy have provided more hypotheses for bone defect treatment. In vivo assessment to test these hypotheses requires animal models to mimic human conditions. Immunodeficient or nude animals have the advantage of hosting materials from human and other xenographic origins without immuno-intolerance or rejection. A thorough understanding of the biology in nude animals is vital for the further advancement of connective tissue healing and regeneration strategies. Nude mice are excellent xenographic hosts for in- vivo characterisation and provide a reproducible animal source. The immune deficiencies of nude compared to normal animals may however, influence bone healing and need to be addressed. This dissertation (a) investigated potential bone defect models in nude mice and nude rats (b) incorporated the selected bone defect model to evaluate the effect of T cell deficiency and age on bone defect healing in nude animals (c) determined the feasibility of a critical size defect (CSD) in nude mice. A distal-femur-condylar-defect (DFCD) model was successfully performed in nude mice and rats. The model was found to have some advantages as a bone defect model: (1) located at a weight-bearing skeletal site (2) no requirements for an internal or external fixator (3) does not obstruct or limit mobility (4) location is not in close proximity to any major organs such as the brain (5) easy identification of surface anatomy (6) defect size is standardised and reproducible (7) does not require lengthy and complicated surgery and (8) cost effective. This dissertation confirmed that bone healing in nude mice is similar to that of normal immunocompetent mice. Absence of T lymphocytes did not delay or inhibit bone repair. Use of older nude mice did not seem to affect the healing rate, in contrast to older normal mice, which showed delay in bone healing in the initial phase. Establishment of critical sized defects in mice at a weight-bearing location was not feasible due to the robust healing of murine. This dissertation recommends that the DFCD model could be utilized for the assessment of xenogenic materials at early time point.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bone-grafting</field><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time-dependent cracking and crack control in reinforced concrete structures</field><field name="creator">Nejadi, Shamsaddin, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Due to the relatively low tensile strength of concrete, cracks are inevitable in reinforced concrete structures. Therefore, studying the cracking behaviour of reinforced concrete elements and controlling the width of cracks are necessary objectives both in research and in design. The introduction of higher strength reinforcing steel has exacerbated the problem of crack control. Using higher strength steel, means less steel is required for a given structure to satisfy the strength requirements. The stiffness after cracking is reduced and wider crack widths will occur under normal service loads. Unserviceable cracking may encourage corrosion in the reinforcement and surface deterioration, and may lead to long term problems with durability. Indeed excessive cracking results in a huge annual cost to the construction industry because it is the most common cause of damage in concrete structures. In this study cracking caused by both shrinkage and external loads in reinforced concrete members is examined experimentally and analytically. The mechanisms associated with cracking and the factors affecting the time-varying width and spacing of both direct tension cracks due to restrained shrinkage deformation and flexural cracks due to the combined effects of constant sustained service loads and shrinkage are examined. Laboratory tests on eight fully restrained slab specimens were conducted for up to 150 days to measure the effects of drying shrinkage on the time-dependent development of direct tension cracks due to restrained deformation. The effect of varying the quantity, diameter, and spacing of reinforcing steel bars was studied. In addition, an analytical model previously developed without experimental verification by Gilbert (1992) to study shrinkage cracking was modified and recalibrated. A second series of tests on twenty four prismatic, singly reinforced concrete beams and slabs subjected to monotonically increasing loads or to constant sustained service loads for up to 400 days, were also conducted. The effects of steel area, steel stress, bar diameter, bar spacing, concrete cover and shrinkage were measured and quantified. An analytical model is presented to simulate instantaneous and time-dependent flexural cracking. The tension chord model (Marti et al, 1998) is modified and used in the proposed model to simulate the tension zone of a flexural member and the time-dependent effects of creep and shrinkage are included. The analytical predictions of crack width and crack spacing are in reasonably good agreement with the experimental observations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reinforced concrete</field><field name="subject">concrete</field><field name="subject">cracking</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy in question: from problem solving to problematology</field><field name="creator">Turnbull, Nicholas James, Social Science &amp; Policy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since the postpositivist critique of the policy sciences, policy theory has come into question. More particularly, the ???problem orientation??? upon which Lasswell defined the policy sciences has come into question because policy making does not conform to his problem solving logic. That logic is inadequate. I argue that we must reconsider the problem orientation at a philosophical level to reconstruct it upon a more appropriate foundation. This thesis does not depict how we should conduct policy making but deals with foundational concepts and issues. I draw on Michel Meyer's new philosophy of questioning, problematology, to consider policy theory in terms of questioning and to reconstruct the problem orientation on problematological grounds.  The thesis is in two parts. Part I reviews and critiques past policy theory in terms of questioning, commencing from the problem solving basis of Dewey's philosophy and Lasswell???s ???policy sciences???. I criticise this basis and outline how it made politics and argumentation residual aspects of reason. I discuss how the postpositivist critique problematised the policy sciences and how this permits us to pose policy theory itself as a question. Part II answers this question by reconstructing policy theory upon the problematological foundation of knowledge. Meyer???s logic of questioning incorporates problematicity in answering, allowing us to account for the politics of policy. I outline the dynamic nature of the logic of questioning and how it incorporates key concepts of interpretative epistemology; hermeneutics, dialectic, and rhetoric. I conclude by describing policy making as a synthesis of two questions: the policy question and the question of legitimacy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">policy sciences</field><field name="subject">problematology</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22382</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CFD modeling of heat exchange fouling</field><field name="creator">Walker, Patrick Gareth, Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Heat exchanger fouling is the deposition of material onto the heat transfer surface causing a reduction in thermal efficiency.  A study using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was conducted to increase understanding of key aspects of fouling in desalination processes.  Fouling is a complex phenomenon and therefore this numerical model was developed in stages.  Each stage required a critical assessment of each fouling process in order to design physical models to describe the process???s intricate kinetic and thermodynamic behaviour.  The completed physical models were incorporated into the simulations through employing extra transport equations, and coding additional subroutines depicting the behaviour of the aqueous phase involved in the fouling phenomena prominent in crystalline streams.  The research objectives of creating a CFD model to predict fouling behaviour and assess the influence of key operating parameters were achieved.  The completed model of the key crystallisation fouling processes monitors the temporal variation of the fouling resistance.  The fouling rates predicted from these results revealed that the numerical model satisfactorily reproduced the phenomenon observed experimentally.  Inspection of the CFD results at a local level indicated that the interface temperature was the most influential operating parameter.  The research also examined the likelihood that the crystallisation and particulate fouling mechanisms coexist.  It was found that the distribution of velocity increased the likelihood of the particulate phase forming within the boundary layer, thus emphasizing the importance of differentiating between behaviour within the bulk and the boundary layer.  These numerical results also implied that the probability of this composite fouling was greater in turbulent flow.  Finally, supersaturation was confirmed as the key parameter when precipitation occurred within the bulk/boundary layer.  This investigation demonstrated the advantages of using CFD to assess heat exchanger fouling.  It produced additional physical models which when incorporated into the CFD code adequately modeled key aspects of the crystallisation and particulate fouling mechanisms.  These innovative modelling ideas should encourage extensive use of CFD in future fouling investigations.  It is recommended that further work include detailed experimental data to assist in defining the key kinetic and thermodynamic parameters to extend the scope of the required physical models.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">crystallisation fouling</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">heat transfer</field><field name="subject">desalination</field><field name="subject">heat exchangers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22385</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aircraft noise and public health : acoustical measurement and social survey around Sydney  (Kingsford Smith) Airport</field><field name="creator">Issarayangyun, Tharit, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The development of major commercial airports promotes the air transport industry and generates positive economic benefits to the airport and to its host economy. However, external costs are associated with these benefits. Any increase in aircraft movement causes negative environmental impacts, especially noise pollution. Governments have reduced aircraft noise levels at their sources, or introduced aircraft noise management strategies (ANMS); however the problems have never been satisfactorily resolved. This research aims at developing a better understanding of the impacts of aircraft noise on community health and well-being by exploring two core research questions: (1) ???Is health related quality of life worse in communities chronically exposed to aircraft noise than in communities not exposed????; and (2) ???Does long-term aircraft noise exposure associate with adult high blood pressure level via noise stress as a mediating factor????. The Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport has been selected as a case study. The health survey instruments have been developed and piloted, and then translated from English into Greek and Arabic. A postal self-administrative health survey (with follow-up letters) has been implemented in the areas surrounding Sydney Airport (called ???aircraft noise exposure group???) and in the matched control group. The total sample size was 1,500 with 47% response rate. This thesis has developed a ???new??? noise index (named Noise Gap Index, NGI) to describe and assess aircraft noise in such a way that is easily understood by the layperson. Factorial analysis of covariance revealed that ???Health related quality of life, in term of physical functioning, general health, vitality, and mental health, of community chronically exposed to high aircraft noise level were worse than the matched control area???. Binary logistic regression analysis found that ???Subjects (aged 15 ??? 87) who have been chronically exposed to high aircraft noise level have the odds of 2.61 of having chronic noise stress. In addition person who have chronic noise stress have the odds of 2.74 of having hypertension compared with those without chronic noise stress???. Finally, the robust hypotheses of effects of aircraft noise on community health and well-being for future experimental study were proposed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aircraft Noise</field><field name="subject">Health Related Quality of Life</field><field name="subject">Hypertension</field><field name="subject">Airport noise</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">Measurement</field><field name="subject">Airplanes</field><field name="subject">Noise</field><field name="subject">Health aspects</field><field name="subject">Public health</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognates, competition and control in bilingual speech production</field><field name="creator">Bond, Rachel Jacqueline, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">If an individual speaks more than one language, there are always at least two ways of verbalising any thought to be expressed. The bilingual speaker must then have a means of ensuring that their utterances are produced in the desired language. However, prominent models of speech production are based almost exclusively on monolingual considerations and require substantial modification to account for bilingual production. A particularly important feature to be explained is the way bilinguals control the language of speech production: for instance, preventing interference from the unintended language, and switching from one language to another. One recent model draws a parallel between bilinguals??? control of their linguistic system and the control of cognitive tasks more generally. The first two experiments reported in this thesis explore the validity of this model by comparing bilingual language switching with a monolingual switching task, as well as to the broader task-switching literature. Switch costs did not conform to the predictions of the task-set inhibition hypothesis in either experiment, as the ???paradoxical??? asymmetry of switch costs was not replicated and some conditions showed benefits, rather than costs, for switching between languages or tasks. Further experiments combined picture naming with negative priming and semantic competitor priming paradigms to examine the role of inhibitory and competitive processes in bilingual lexical selection. Each experiment was also conducted in a parallel monolingual version. Very little negative priming was evident when speaking the second language, but the effects of interlingual cognate status were pronounced. There were some indications of cross-language competition at the level of lexical selection: participants appeared unable to suppress the irrelevant language, even when doing so would make the task easier. Across all the experiments, there was no evidence for global inhibition of the language-not-in-use during speech production. Overall results were characterised by a remarkable flexibility in the mechanisms of bilingual control. A striking dissociation emerged between the patterns of results for cognate and non-cognate items, which was reflected throughout the series of experiments and implicates qualitative differences in the way these lexical items are represented and interconnected.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bilingualism</field><field name="subject">speech production</field><field name="subject">lexical access</field><field name="subject">cognate words</field><field name="subject">speech</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of reductive methods in organophosphorus chemistry</field><field name="creator">Donoghue, Neil, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with the reductive cleavage of tetracoordinated organophos-phorus compounds (either quaternary phosphonium salts R4P+ X??? or tertiary phosphine oxides R3P=O) with either the naphthalene radical (naphthalenide) anion or lithium aluminium hy-dride in THF solution at room temperature (RT). Part 1 examines the reaction of lithium naphthalenide with both phosphonium salts and phosphine oxides. The reaction was dem-onstrated to cleave phenyl groups from both bis-salts and bis-oxides in the presence of 1,2-ethylene bridges; based upon this, parallel syntheses of either 1,4-diphosphabicyclo[2.2.2]oc-tane or its P,P'-dioxide were attempted by using the commercially available ethane-1,2-bis-(diphenylphosphine) as the starting material in each case. Examination of the products ofreductive cleavage of the series of benzylphenylphosphonium bromide [PhnP(CH2Ph)4-n]+ Br???(where n = 0 to 3) with lithium naphthalenide leads to the proposal of a mechanism. Part 2 describes hydridic reductions of both quaternary phosphonium salts and ter-tiary phosphine oxides. Examination of the lithium aluminium hydride reduction of qua-ternary phosphonium salts using 31P-NMR has confirmed tetraorganophosphoranes (R4PH; R = Ph, alkyl) as intermediates in the reaction; in addition, two previously unknown classes of compounds, the triorganophosphoranes R3PH2 and the tetraorganophosphoranates R4PH2???, were also found to be intermediates. The behaviour of bis-phosphonium salts where the phosphonium centres are separated by either 1,2-ethylene or 1,3-propylene bridges are also examined. Formation of a monocation exhibiting a bridging hydride occurs when the cyclic bis-phosphonium salt 1,1,5,5-tetraphenyl-1,5-diphosphocanium dibromide is reacted with li-thium aluminium hydride.

This requires an understanding of the mechanisms of fluid flow in naturally fractured reservoirs and the detailed properties of individual fractures and matrix porous media. This study has been carried out to address the issues and difficulties faced by previous methods; to establish possible answers to minimise the difficulties; and hence, to improve the efficiency of reservoir simulation through the use of properties of individual fractures. The methodology used in this study combines several mathematical and numerical techniques like the boundary element method, periodic boundary conditions, and the control volume mixed finite element method. This study has contributed to knowledge in the calculation of the effective permeability and simulation of fluid flow in naturally fractured reservoirs through the development of two algorithms. The first algorithm calculates the effective permeability tensor by use of properties of arbitrary oriented fractures (location, size and orientation). It includes all multi-scaled fractures and considers the appropriate method of analysis for each type of fracture (short, medium and long). In this study a characterisation module which provides the detail information for individual fractures is incorporated. The effective permeability algorithm accounts for fluid flows in the matrix, between the matrix and the fracture and disconnected fractures on effective permeability. It also accounts for the properties of individual fractures in calculation of the effective permeability tensor. The second algorithm simulates flow of single-phase fluid in naturally fractured reservoirs by use of the effective permeability tensor. This algorithm takes full advantage of the control volume discretisation technique and the mixed finite element method in calculation of pressure and fluid flow velocity in each grid block. It accounts for the continuity of flux between the neighbouring blocks and has the advantage of calculation of fluid velocity and pressure, directly from a system of first order equations (Darcy???s law and conservation of mass???s law). The application of the effective permeability tensor in the second algorithm allows us the simulation of fluid flow in naturally fractured reservoirs with large number of multi-scale fractures. The fluid pressure and velocity distributions obtained from this study are important and can considered for further studies in hydraulic fracturing and production optimization of NFRs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">effective permeability</field><field name="subject">fluid flow</field><field name="subject">naturally fractured reservoirs</field><field name="subject">rocks</field><field name="subject">fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">hydrocarbon reservoirs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Age related variations in anterior ocular characteristics and response to short term contact lens wear</field><field name="creator">Jayakumar, Jaikishan, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis was to investigate age related variations in anterior ocular characteristics and their effect on the response to short-term (one-hour) open eye orthokeratology (OK) lens wear and overnight hydrogel lens wear. Sixty-three volunteer subjects were divided into three groups comprising children (Group I), young adults (Group II) and older adults (Group III). Anterior ocular characteristics that were measured included corneal topography with the Medmont corneal topographer, total, stromal and epithelial thickness with the Holden-Payor optical pachometer, microscopic cell characteristics with the confocal microscope, corneal aesthesiometry, corneal modulus of elasticity, and tear film, palpebral and eyelid characteristics. The older cornea was found to be more spherical in shape (asphericity Q = -0.24 ?? 0.07 in group III compared to -0.34 ?? 0.09 and -0.32 ?? 0.17 in groups I and II respectively) and showed a tendency from with-the-rule to against-the-rule astigmatism. Older subjects also had a decreased endothelial cell density (2596 ?? 111 cells/mm2 in group III compared to 2793 ?? 138 cells/mm2 in group II) and reduced eyelid tension compared to the younger groups. Children were found to have lower blink rates than adults. It was concluded that these changes might have a significant impact on contact lens wear. The responses to two contact lens based techniques, orthokeratology (OK) and hydrogel overnight wear (ON), were studied. Sixty subjects (20 per group) wore reverse-geometry lenses (BE, Ultravison Aust Pty Ltd) of Boston XO material in one eye under open eye conditions for one hour in one eye only. Changes in unaided visual acuity, corneal curvature, corneal thickness and confocal microscopic variables were measured after OK lens wear. All subject groups showed statistically significant improvements (p &amp;lt 0.05) in unaided visual acuity, a trend for more positive (less prolate) corneal asphericity, increase in apical corneal radius and decrease in central total corneal thickness, after OK lens wear. When the groups were stratified, statistical significance was obtained between the older group and the other two younger groups for change in apical corneal radius (0.23 ?? 0.01 mm in group I, 0.15 ?? 0.01 mm for group II, 0.06 ?? 0.33 for group III). The change in asphericity also showed significant differences between the older age group (0.10 ?? 0.08 mm) and the young adult group (0.21 ?? 0.13). Central corneal thinning obtained after one hour of OK lens wear revealed significant differences between the older adult group (-1.9 ?? 3.2 ??m) and the other two groups (-5.0 ?? 5.9 ??m in group I, -5.0 ?? 2.0 ??m for group II). Sixty subjects wore hydrogel lenses (One-Day Acuvue, Johnson and Johnson Visioncare Pty Ltd) made of etafilcon A in one eye only overnight during sleep at their home. Changes in unaided visual acuity, corneal curvature, corneal thickness, confocal microscopic variables and slitlamp variables were measured after ON lens wear. All subjects showed significant thickening (p &amp;lt 0.05) of the cornea with ON wear, more in the lens-wearing eye. This study reported that the edema response induced by Acuvue contact lenses is stromal in origin. The edema response of the older group (33.9 ?? 11.5 ??m) was lower than the other two groups as demonstrated by the difference in the change in central stromal thickness (49.3 ?? 20.3 ??m for group I and 51.0 ?? 20.0 ??m for group II). However, a statistically significant difference in the change in thickness was not reached either for the central total corneal thickness or for other topographic locations. Corneal and visual changes found in this study confirm previous reports of the effects of short term OK and hydrogel ON lens wear. Older lens wearers showed a reduced or delayed response to short-term lens wear. Studies investigating the effects of age with long lens-wearing durations are warranted to quantify these effects further.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Contact lenses; Orthokeratology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of fragmentation and disturbance on a eucalypt open-forest plant community in south-eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Ross, Karen, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study documented effects of fragmentation and disturbance on a coastal eucalypt dry open-forest plant community at Port Stephens-Myall Lakes, south-eastern Australia. The study evaluated the relative influence of fragment size (range &amp;lt1-75ha), fragment or edge age (&amp;lt 1-25y), time since fire (5-25y) and anthropogenic disturbance (minor, major) on microclimate, native plant species richness and weed invasion. Plots were sampled for native and exotic species richness per 25 m2 and edge transects for light, soil moisture, soil temperature, vegetation structure, native species richness and exotic species richness and cover. Depths of edge influence (DEI) were all &amp;lt 20m inside the forest edge. Younger edge zones were lighter, had hotter and drier soils and more native species than forest interiors. Older edge zones were shadier, had warmer and moister soils and fewer native species than forest interiors, due to vegetation thickening in the edge zone. Light and soil moisture followed linear or monotonic edge-to-interior gradients in younger edges, but more complex patterns in older edges. Soil-temperature DEI decreased with increasing edge age. Fragment size had little influence on edge effects, but those for light developed more rapidly in smaller fragments, and recent fire was associated with reduced richness in edge zones of smaller fragments. Both anthropogenic disturbance and fire enlarged DEI for native species richness. Major anthropogenic disturbance coupled with fragmentation produced a stronger and more immediate loss of native species than fragmentation alone. Small fragments with minor disturbance had fewer native species per 25 m2 than larger fragments, but only after &amp;gt10y since fragmentation. Analysis of forest interior portions of transects revealed that edge effects, and possibly disturbance, were largely responsible for this loss of native species with time, rather than effects of area. Despite a viable soil seed bank in fragments and the surrounding matrix, weed invasion in fragments was minimal. Exotic species were concentrated in edge zones, and were promoted by major anthropogenic disturbance within fragments. Results were highly dependent on fragment or edge age, and external influences of fragmentation (edge effects and disturbance), were more important than biogeographic (area-driven) factors.

Recently, some of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to have the ability to interfere with microbial biofilm formation. In this project, antibacterial properties of commonly used NSAIDs (salicylic acid, sodium diclofenac and ketorolac) were assessed and characterised using biological assays and molecular biological techniques. Salicylic acid, ketorolac and diclofenac reduced adhesion of a range of bacterial species isolated from corneal infection and inflammatory events to contact lenses in a dose-dependent manner. Salicylic acid also decreased the adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis to human corneal epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Results further demonstrated that NSAIDs had a significant impact on the production of virulence factors such as Type IV pili mediated (twitching) motility, flagella mediated swimming, elastase, protease IV and alkaline protease and affected the production of acylated homoserine lactones of P. aeruginosa. Salicylic acid and ketorolac affect the expression of P. aeruginosa outer membrane proteins. In the presence of the salicylic acid and ketorolac more than 85% of all detectable outer membrane proteins changed and most were down-regulated. Moreover, in the presence of salicylic acid at least five gene products, including Na+ - translocating NADH (Nrq1), choline dehydrogenase (CHDH), a hypothetical protein of unknown function, a gene product with no similarity to any known sequence in the database and a sequence similar to 23S rRNA of P. aeruginosa, were down-regulated. The results of this study clearly demonstrated that NSAIDs have a significant impact on virulence factors and the expression of acylated homoserine lactones by P. aeruginosa. This thesis has illustrated the potential of NSAIDs for preventing bacterial contamination of contact lenses by ocular pathogens and highlights the potential for NSAIDs as antibacterial agents. Therefore, this class of compound should be investigated further for their therapeutic efficacy in vivo.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents</field><field name="subject">Antibacterial agents</field><field name="subject">Contact lenses</field><field name="subject">Complications</field><field name="subject">Cornea</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond representation : Coetzee, Deleuze, and the colonial subject</field><field name="creator">Hamilton, Grant A. R., School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns the colonial subject, subjectivity, and resistance in postcolonial theory and literature.  It argues that contemporary attempts within the practice of postcolonial theory to retrieve a colonial subject from a representation that issues from a dominating colonial discourse can only be met with failure.  Thus, this thesis follows Spivak's claim that the colonial subject is merely a production of positions granted by its very representation, which is to say, a given.  However, this thesis also recognises that Spivak's assertion cannot account for moments of resistance to colonial discourse that abound in postcolonial literature.  As such, this thesis claims that the colonial subject is not wholly given; that if one approaches the colonial subject through Gilles Deleuze's re-writing of subjectivity, demonstrated in the concept of 'the body without organs', then a transcendent configuration of the colonial subject is revealed.  In elucidating this claim, this thesis turns to the fiction of South African academic and novelist, J.M. Coetzee.  It is argued that Coetzee writes the Other by 'staging it', that is by testing the limits and eventually going beyond the authoritarian regime of representation.  Thus, this thesis is constructed by three main chapters that offer both a rethinking of postcolonial theory in light of the work of Deleuze, and a reading of a selected cynosure of texts authored by Coetzee.  The first chapter is a reading of Coetzee's Dusklands that concentrates on the body as a site of resistance to the manoeuvres of representation, demonstrating it to be a site that takes authority in the production of truth from the 'objective', structured methodology of reason, while the second chapter offers a reading of Coetzee's Waiting for the Barbarians that interrogates the postcolonial concern with  'space'.  It is in this novel that Coetzee renders space in terms of its dynamic relationship with the nomad, which ultimately problematises the colonial endeavour to organise, represent, and thereby, 'know' the world.  The final chapter engages Coetzee's Foe by way of a sustained critique of the operation of language, and demonstrates how Coetzee manages to test the boundaries of representation through language use.  As such, each chapter offers a specific account of an entire programme that tends towards the transgression of the binds organised by the operation of representation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Postcolonialism in literature</field><field name="subject">Coetzee</field><field name="subject">J.

I have coined the term ???friction???, as a writing practice, to describe the space in-between narrative conception and conscious, ordered reflection upon that narrative. Thus, the thesis comprises an exploration of Foucault's intersecting marginal zone, which is an integral aspect of his philosophic concept of ???positive unconscious???. The ???positive unconscious??? is where the overlapping sections of what Foucault calls, a ???table??? (creative narrative) and ???tabula??? (the ordering of the narrative) are situated. The frictional form is synonymous with Foucault's concept. It is as a developing narrative conception that becomes an ordered practice, and also aims to be what Jacques Derrida calls ???a new writing???. Hence, Foucault's ???positive unconscious???, Derrida's ???new writing???, and the frictional narrative process all comprise, along with and through the multiple inclusions of myriad theorists, philosophers, fiction writers, lyric poets, etc., an amalgamated whole ???new??? narrative (the frictionalised thesis). The paradox of the ???new??? (frictional) narrative is that through mimesis comes characterised difference - a ???new??? hybridised space is opened up which both fascinates and appals, railing as it does against fixed, constraining and systematised linguistic and discursive structures. Yet this is a stimulating space that ultimately brings new focus to stifling self-conformity. It is a frictional space comprised of a profusion of literary ???voices??? made singular, a singularity that is also mutiplicitous in its composite origin. It is a frictional observance that refutes the injunction of needing definite closure given its inclusion of potentially unlimited sources.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narration Rhetoric</field><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="subject">Michel</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22376</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speech analysis techniques useful for low or variable bit rate coding</field><field name="creator">Kim, Hyun Soo, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">We investigate, improve and develop speech analysis techniques which can be used to enhance various speech processing systems, especially low bit rate or variable bit rate coding of speech. The coding technique based on the sinusoidal representation of speech is investigated and implemented. Based on this study of the sinusoidal model of speech, improved analysis techniques to determine voicing, pitch and spectral estimation are developed, as well as noise reduction technique. We investigate the properties and limitations of the spectral envelope estimation vocoder (SEEVOC). We generalize, optimize and improve the SEEVOC and also compare it with LP in the presence of noise. The properties and applications of morphological filters for speech analysis are investigated. We introduce and investigate a novel nonlinear spectral envelope estimation method based on morphological operations, which is found to be very robust against noise. This method is also compared with the SEEVOC method. A simple method for the optimum selection of the structuring set size without using prior pitch information is proposed for many purposes. The morphological approach is then used for a new pitch estimation method and for the general sinusoidal analysis of speech or audio. Many of the new methods are based on a novel systematic analysis of the peak features of signals, including the study of higher order peaks. We propose a novel peak feature algorithm, which measure the peak characteristics of speech signal in time domain, to be used for end point detection and segmentation of speech. This nonparametric algorithm is flexible, efficient and very robust in noise. Several simple voicing measures are proposed and used in a new speech classifier. The harmonic-plus-noise decomposition technique is improved and extended to give an alternative to the methods used in the sinusoidal analysis method. Its applications to pitch estimation, speech classification and noise reduction are investigated.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Speech processing systems</field><field name="subject">Vocoder</field><field name="subject">Coding theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strength and ductility of fibre reinforced high strength concrete columns</field><field name="creator">Zaina, Mazen Said, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The main structural objectives in column design are strength and ductility. For higher strength concretes these design objectives are offset by generally poor concrete ductility and early spalling of the concrete cover. When fibres are added to the concrete the post peak characteristics are enhanced, both in tension and in compression. Most of the available experimental data, on fibre reinforced concrete and fibre reinforced high strength concrete columns, suggest that an improvement in both ductility and load carrying capacity due to the inclusion of the fibres.   In this thesis the ductility and strength of fibre reinforced high strength concrete are investigated to evaluate the effect of the different parameters on the performance of columns. The investigation includes both experimental and the numerical approaches with 56 high strength fibre reinforced concrete columns being tested. The concrete strength ranged between 80 and 100 MPa and the columns were reinforced with 1, 2 or 2.6 percent, by weight, of end hooked steel fibres. The effect of corrugated Polypropylene fibres on the column performance was also examined. No early spalling of the cover was observed in any of the steel fibre reinforced column tested in this study. A numerical model was developed for analysis of fibre and non-fibre reinforced eccentrically loaded columns. The column is modelled as finite layers of reinforced concrete. Two types of layers are used, one to represent the hinged zone and the second the unloading portion of the column. As the concrete in the hinged layers goes beyond the peak for the stress verus strain in the concrete the section will continue to deform leading to a localised region within a column. The numerical model is compared with the test data and generally shows good correlation. Using the developed model, the parameters that affect ductility in fibre-reinforced high strength concrete columns are investigated and evaluated. A design model relating column ductility with confining pressure is proposed that includes the effects of the longitudinal reinforcement ratio, the loading eccentricity and the fibre properties and content and design recommendations are given.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Columns Concrete</field><field name="subject">Testing</field><field name="subject">Reinforced concrete Fiber</field><field name="subject">High strength concrete</field><field name="subject">Reinforced concrete construction</field><field name="subject">fiber</field><field name="subject">spalling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22054</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aids dementia complex in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy: a neuropsychological study</field><field name="creator">Cysique, Lucette Adeline Juliette, St. Vincent's Hospital, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of the thesis was to undertake an evaluation of the neuropsychological functioning of non-demented and demented patients with advanced HIV-infection who have been treated with Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) for several years. One hundred and one non-demented HIV-infected individuals and 23 patients with mild or moderate AIDS Dementia Complex (ADC), from the outpatient clinics and Neurology department at St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, Australia were randomly selected to participate in a prospective study of the neurological and neuropsychological complications of HIV disease. All had advanced HIV-infection and all had been on HAART for five years on average. Thirty-one seronegative controls were recruited as controls. All participants completed a standard neuropsychological examination assessing nine cognitive domains. Non-demented advanced HIV-infected individuals participated in three follow-up visits. In addition, we report the results of a multi-centre cohort of 78 patients with mild to moderate ADC on HAART (Abacavir ADC trial). The main findings of our research were that the prevalence of neuropsychological impairment in advanced HIV-infected individuals remains equivalent to the era that preceded the introduction of HAART. Moreover, while complex attention / psychomotor speed remained a marker of HIV-related neuropsychological impairment in the HAART era, impairment in learning, memory and aspects of complex attention may be new indicators of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment. While progression of neuropsychological impairment is associated with past HIV-related history of brain involvement, we demonstrated that deterioration does not occur in a linear fashion and that over a 27 month period neuropsychological performance stabilizes in the majority. Stabilization of performance may be related to relapses in the course of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment and HAART optimization especially with antiretrovirals that have good brain tissue penetrance. Our research showed that plasma viral load and current CD4 cell count were generally not associated with the neuropsychological performance, but rather that nadir CD4 cell count was associated with neuropsychological performance suggesting a relation between past immune deterioration and current cognitive status. Cerebrospinal markers of immune and virological activity were found to be partly dissociated from current neurological in contrast to what was observed in the pre-HAART era. Future studies will need to evaluate new factors for underlying HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment as well as factors for underlying partial recovery.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS dementia complex</field><field name="subject">Pathogenesis</field><field name="subject">Treatment</field><field name="subject">Antiretroviral agents</field><field name="subject">Aids Disease</field><field name="subject">Patients</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">HIV Viruses</field><field name="subject">Neuropsychology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22074</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cavity expansion in unsaturated soils</field><field name="creator">Russell, Adrian Robert, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The problem of cavity expansion in unsaturated soils is investigated. A unified constitutive model for unsaturated soils is presented in a critical state framework using the concepts of effective stress and bounding surface plasticity theory. Consideration is given to the effects of suction and particle crushing in the definition of the critical state. A simple isotropic elastic rule is adopted. A loading surface and bounding surface of the same shape are defined using simple and versatile functions. A limiting isotropic compression line exists, towards which the stress trajectories of all isotropic compression load paths approach. A non-associated flow rule is assumed for all soil types. Isotropic hardening/softening occurs due to changes in plastic volumetric strains as well as suction for some unsaturated soils, enabling account of the phenomenon of volumetric collapse upon wetting. Results of isotropic compression tests, oedometric compression tests and drained and undrained triaxial compression tests performed on Kurnell (quartz) sand in saturated and unsaturated states and subjected to stresses sufficient to cause particle crushing are presented and used to calibrate the model. The model is also calibrated using results reported in the literature for triaxial tests performed on saturated and unsaturated speswhite kaolin and three load paths. For both soils the model leads to a much improved fit between simulation and experiment compared to that for models based on conventional plasticity theory. The model is implemented into a cavity expansion analysis using the similarity technique, extended for application to unsaturated soils. Cylindrical and spherical cavities are considered, as are drained and undrained conditions. Cavity expansion results for the bounding surface model and conventional plasticity models are compared for saturated conditions. Substantial differences highlight the importance of adopting a model that accurately describes stress-strain behaviour. Cavity expansion results for the bounding surface model and saturated and unsaturated conditions are also compared. Substantial differences, particularly in the limit pressure, highlight the major influence of suction and the importance of accounting for this when using cavity expansion theory to interpret results of the cone penetration and pressuremeter tests.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil mechanics</field><field name="subject">Soil moisture</field><field name="subject">Deformations Mechanics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing creative and health production processes : issues, similarities and differences</field><field name="creator">Hillier, Fleur Jane, School of Public Health &amp; community medicine. Centre for Clinical Governance Research in Health, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis I am concerned to examine the management behaviours and predilections of managers across the two settings of health and theatre considered to be divergent.  To do this I explore and map methods, similarities and differences managers employ to ???manage??? workers across the industries.  I also deconstruct creativity and its manifestations in both managerial behaviours and environmental contexts and map the complexity issues that managers face in different settings.  Further, I explore the extent to which management activity is contextual to the identity of participant organisational aims and processes and examine the level of calculated chaos experienced by managers across the settings.  Central to this approach is the utilisation of multi-method design incorporating interview, micro-ethnography, auto-ethnography and a RAND expert panel to assist with interpretation of the results.  Core findings include high degrees of similarity in the roles and functions and support systems utilised by managers across the settings despite substantial differences in environmental contexts and organisational aims and processes.  Differences were identified in the areas of: levels of chaos, interactions, purposes, and environmental characteristics.  To account for these differences I apprehended seven metafactors grounded in the data sets.  These seven metafactors can be found in each setting but emerge in different ways.  The metafactors that I apprehend are order versus disorder; creativity; experimentation and change; risk; reflection; trust and respect; and time and pressure.  While I discuss these seven metafactors as separate factors in reality they are fundamentally inter-related.

During the past two decades rationalisation and privatisation of services has led to the closure of many basic services in rural Australia. The withdrawal of services has necessitated longer distance travel for many rural residents ??? a problem which has been exacerbated by the rationalisation of public transport services. As a result there have emerged severe accessibility and mobility problems in rural areas, despite the presence of high levels of car ownership in such areas. In terms of rural transportation, the situation in Australia is characterised by two different features; first, poor public transport provision (or non-existence). Second; high levels of car ownership among rural residents. However, high levels of car ownership do not reflect high levels of prosperity; this is likely to indicate a situation of &amp;quotenforced ownership&amp;quot in response to declining levels of public transport provision. Furthermore, many rural residents neither own a car nor have access to a reliable public transport system due to socio-economic and location-based circumstances. Previous research has shown that these residents generally belong to groups who include the elderly, teenagers, students, Indigenous residents, unemployed persons and low-income households. Such groups have been termed transport-disadvantaged. The contention of this thesis, however, is that such groups are in a state of &amp;quottransport need&amp;quot given their range of transport related problems. This is one dimension of the accessibility problem in rural Australia, which has yet to be investigated. This thesis is concerned with the measurement of transport need through the development of several transport need indices using available census data. The key objective of this thesis is to investigate the relevance and suitability of need indices for identifying the relative spatial distribution of transport needs in rural areas. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) is used for the development, analysis and visualisation of the transport need index. This thesis examines transportation needs in rural NSW simply by measuring &amp;quotdemand&amp;quot and &amp;quotsupply&amp;quot components of transport. To measure the demand index, some socio-economic characteristics of population are involved including: the elderly, no or low car owning households, Indigenous people, students, children, unemployed persons, low-income households, and accessibility. A weight has been assigned to each component based on its relative importance among the other components. Weighted values are then standardised based on 100. To measure the supply index, six components, which represent the availability of various kinds of transport in rural NSW are involved and have been calculated by assigning weights and standardising to 100. These are: CountryLink rail services, CountryLink coach and bus services, Regional Services, Community Transport Program, Wheelchair taxi services, and School Buses. The final transport need for rural NSW is calculated by dividing demand index by supply index. It simply quantifies transportation needs across the rural Statistical Local Areas (SLAs) of NSW. In addition, this thesis discusses the potential and limitations of GIS and our transport need indices to be used as input to decisions about improvements in provision of services, and coordination of existing services to better meet identified needs, for the transport disadvantaged in rural NSW. In essence, this thesis is an attempt to make Australian transport and social services planners aware of the value of a need based transport-planning methodology.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transportation</field><field name="subject">rural transportation</field><field name="subject">geographic information systems</field><field name="subject">New South Wales.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optical transitions in SiO2/crystalline Si/SiO2 quantum wells and nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si)/SiO2    superlattice fabrication (Restricted for 24 months until Feb. 2006)</field><field name="creator">Cho, Eun Chel, Electrical Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Innovation in photovoltaic technology may offer cost competitive options to other energy sources and become a viable solution for the energy and environmental challenges of the 21st century. One proposed innovative technology is based on all-silicon tandem cells, which are constructed using superlattices consisting of environmental friendly Si and its compounds. The well and barrier materials in superlattices are restricted to silicon and silicon oxide during the present study.  Single crystalline Si/SiO2 quantum wells (QWs) have been fabricated by thermal oxidation of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers. It is found that oxide properties in QWs are important for SOI wafers prepared by the SIMOX (Separation by Implantation of Oxygen) technique. However, QWs fabricated from SOI wafers prepared by the ELTRAN (Epitaxial Layer TRANsfer) approach show the effect of quantum confinement without evidence of strong oxide interfacial transitions. In these wafers, evidence for an apparently ordered silicon oxide was found with 1.92?atomic fringe spacing along the (110) direction of the Si structure and with the thickness about 17?along the (100) direction of the Si structure. Luminescence wavelength ranges are from 700nm to 918nm depending on the Si thickness. The luminescence measurements on other positions of the sample show peak and shoulder spectra, which are explained by monolayer fluctuations in QW thicknesses, previously observed in III-V QWs and II-VI QWs.  Si/SiO2 superlattices are fabricated by RF magnetron sputtering. Si density is the key issue in crystallizing the superlattice. High-density Si layers crystallize either under high temperature furnace annealing or rapid thermal process annealing. However, low density Si would not crystallize even at high temperature. Crystallized nanocrystals in the Si layers are observed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) when the Si layer is thicker than 3nm. When Si layers are thinner than 3nm, the Si layers are discontinuous and finally deteriorate into small nanocrystals. The suitability of such superlattices for surface passivation and antireflection coatings is reviewed. Initial attempts to fabricate heterojunctions between Si wafers and Si/SiO2 superlattices resulted in open circuit voltage of 252mV. However, it is expected that better results would be obtained if Si/SiO2 superlattices were fully crystallized.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Si quantum well</field><field name="subject">SOI</field><field name="subject">ELTRAN</field><field name="subject">SIMOX</field><field name="subject">superlattices</field><field name="subject">RF sputtering</field><field name="subject">solar cells</field><field name="subject">quantum wells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22492</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of interrupted time series analysis to evaluate the impact of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme policies on drug utilisation in Australia.</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, Neil James, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">PROBLEM INVESTIGATED: Methodological issues and policy implications arising from the application of interrupted time series (ITS) analyses to assess the impact of Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS) subsidisation policies on drug utilisation in Australia.  PROCEDURES FOLLOWED: A critical review of methodological issues relating to the application and analysis of ITS designs was undertaken.  This included an examination of drug utilisation data sources in Australia.  The PBS policies examined were: (i) the introduction of copayments in 1990; (ii) the introduction of re-supply limits in 1994 and (iii) the introduction of a form of reference pricing in 1998.  Monthly aggregate drug utilisation data was obtained from the Australian Department of Health and Ageing.  Segmented regression analyses incorporating autocorrelated errors were implemented and statistical diagnostics applied to ensure correct ITS model specification. Alternative seasonal modelling approaches were compared.  RESULTS OBTAINED: The copayment ITS evaluation found that while these copayments produced a reduction in the utilisation of essential and discretionary medications, this effect was stronger for discretionary drugs.  An unintended policy effect was a large anticipatory increase in drug utilisation during the month prior to the copayments.  Repatriation PBS data was also utilised due to the limited number of pre-intervention data points in the Community series.  The re-supply limit ITS evaluation found that the 20-day rule markedly reduced the size of the seasonal increase during the month of December.  However, logistic regression analyses showed that the size of this reduction attenuated over time, highlighting the need to consider alternative analysis strategies when applying a ITS approach. The reference pricing ITS evaluation found that this policy had achieved its drug utilisation objectives for H2RAs and ACE Inhibitors.  However with regard to CCBs, no increase in the utilisation of benchmark priced drug was apparent, which probably reflected clinical concerns at the time about the safety of these drugs.  MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Well implemented ITS analyses provide a valuable tool for evaluating the impact of PBS subsidisation policy change on drug utilisation in Australia.  As with any methodology, however, different design and data integrity issues will affect the quality of information provided.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interrupted times series analysis</field><field name="subject">drug utilisation</field><field name="subject">policy evaluation</field><field name="subject">Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BAFF regulation of peripheral T cell responses</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Andrew Peter Robert, St Vincents Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">The activation and effector function of CD4+ T cells are critical points of regulation during an antigen specific T cell response. Dysregulation of these processes can lead to the development of human diseases, encompassing both immunodeficiency and autoimmunity. Members of the TNF superfamily have recently emerged as important regulators of T cell responses, with their overexpression causing autoimmune inflammation in animal models. As overproduction of the novel TNF superfamily ligand BAFF is associated with several autoimmune conditions, we sought to examine the potential role of BAFF as a regulator of T cell activation and effector function. We initially demonstrated BAFF costimulation of T cell activation in vitro. Generation of specific monoclonal antibodies identified BAFF-R as the only BAFF receptor present on T cells, and showed that it was expressed in an activation-dependent and subset-specific manner. Impaired BAFF costimulation in BAFF-R deficient mice indicated that BAFF-R was crucial for mediating BAFF effects in T cells. Analysis of T cell responses in vivo revealed that BAFF transgenic mice have increased T cell priming and recall responses to protein antigens, and showed a corresponding increase in the DTH model of Th1 cell-dependent inflammation. In addition, Th2-dependent allergic airway responses are suppressed in BAFF transgenic mice. Crossing to a B cell deficient background revealed that the proinflammatory effects of BAFF on T cell priming and DTH rely on the presence of B cells, while the suppressive effects during allergic airway inflammation are B cell independent. These data demonstrated that BAFF regulated the outcome of T cell responses in vivo and identified BAFF dependent crosstalk between T and B cells. Stimulation of B cells with BAFF induced the upregulation of MHC class II and ICOS-L both in vitro and in vivo. Induction of these cell surface molecules was associated with an increased capacity to induce T cell proliferation, however this effect was independent of ICOS-L expression. Thus it was demonstrated that BAFF regulated T cell activation and effector function both directly, via stimulation of BAFF-R, and indirectly, by altering the function of B cells. These data suggest that BAFF dependent alterations in T cell function may be an additional causative factor in the association between elevated BAFF levels and the generation of autoimmunity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">tumor necrosis factor</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22788</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biological oceanography of larval fish diversity and growth off eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Syahailatua, Augy, BEES, UNSW</field><field name="description">Fish larvae in Australian waters have been studied progressively in the last 2-3 decades including the distribution and abundance of taxa, growth and age, their prey and predators.  However, the effect of nutrient limitation on ichthyoplankton is unstudied, particularly in the oligotrophic Australian waters.  My study was aimed to examine the effect of natural or anthropogenic nutrients on the abundance, distribution, growth and condition of fish larvae along-shore of the NSW coast (latitude 30-34S), where the East Australian Current departs the NSW coast and generates local upwelling of cool nutrient-rich water.  This study shows no significant difference in the total abundance or diversity of either larval fishes amongst the 112 taxa (111 families and 1 order), among regions within or upstream of the upwelling.  However in both months, there were distinctive ichthyoplankton assemblages at the family level.  The Carangidae, Labridae, Lutjanidae, Microcanthidae, Myctophidae and Scombridae were more abundant in the EAC or oceanic water masses, while the Callionymidae, Clupeidae, Platycephalidae, Sillaginidae and Terapontidae were mostly found in the surface or deep upwelled/uplifted water masses.  This pattern is observed in other ichthyoplankton studies and may be a general and useful method to determine mixing of water masses.  Larvae of silver trevally (Pseudocaranx dentex) and yellowtail scad (Trachurus novaezelandiae) were generally larger and less abundant in the topographically induced upwelling region, than north of the region in pre-upwelled conditions of the East Australian Current. Both species were mostly at the preflexion stage (less than 4.3 mm in body length and less than 10 days old) in the pre-upwelled conditions, particularly during November, and proportionally more larger and older larvae in the upwelled waters (mostly post-flexion, greater than 4.3 mm in body length and greater than 10 days old).  Ages from sagittal otoliths ranged from 2-25 increments (~days) and exhibited linear growth for both species and months over the size range (3-15 mm standard length).  The otolith radius-length relationship and the growth rates were similar between species and months, despite the 3-4C difference between months.  Overall growth rates of the younger larvae were uniform throughout the entire sampling area (0.5-0.6 mm.d-1), while older larvae grew significantly faster in the upwelled water (0.41 mm.d-1) compared to the non-upwelled conditions (0.34 mm.d-1).  Both species tended to be depleted in 13C in the upwelling region (from ???18.5 to ???19.0), consistent with expected ratios from deeper water, whereas the 15N composition tended to increase in Pseudocaranx, but decrease in Trachurus indicating different diets and possibly trophic level.  The early life history of both species indicates spawning in pre-upwelled waters, but larval transport into upwelled waters is necessary for faster growth in the post-flexion stage. The assemblage of larval fishes did differ between the upwelled region and a region south of Sydney???s deepwater outfalls, but the difference was ascribed to a latitudinal effect and the EAC.  Both larval carangids were enriched in 15N, possibly due to the enriched dissolved organic matter of primary treated sewage. In summary, this study found that the larval fish community can provide a biological means to trace water masses, and estimate their degree of mixing.  Remarkably there was no significant effect of upwelling or sewage addition to the abundance or diversity of larval fish, in the nutrient poor waters of the East Australian Current.  Larval carangids and pilchards were abundant in late spring off northern NSW, and their early life histories were inferred.  Both larval carangid species seem to be spawned in the EAC waters, but as post-flexion larvae grew faster in the upwelled zone.  Pre-flexion (less than 10 day old) larval carangids of both genera indicated spawning in the EAC, and the rarer post-flexion (greater than 10 days old) carangids grew faster in the upwelled waters.  Here, both genera had stable isotope signatures characteristic of upwelled waters for carbon, but had different nitrogen signatures, indicative of different diets and trophic level status.  Larval pilchards actually grew more slowly in the upwelling region, as observed in coastal waters off Japan, and their nursery grounds may be further offshore in the Tasman Front, analogous to their early life history in the Kuroshio Extension.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biological oceanography</field><field name="subject">ichthyoplankton</field><field name="subject">eastern Australia</field><field name="subject">Tasman Sea</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22791</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays on macoroeconomics and macroeconomic forecasting</field><field name="creator">Heidari, Hassan, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation collects three independent essays in the area of Macroeconomics and Macroeconomic forecasting. The first chapter introduces and motivates the three essays. Chapter 2 highlights a serious problem of the Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) models with Litterman???s prior cannot be used to get accurate forecasts of the driftless variables in a mixed drift models. BVAR models with Litterman???s prior, because of the diffuse prior on the constant, do not perform well in the long-run forecasting of I(1) variables either, if they have no drift. This is interesting as in practice most of the macro models include both drift and driftless variables. One solution to this problem is using the Bewley (1979) transformation to impose zero drift to driftless variables in a mixed drift VAR models. A novel feature of this chapter is the use of g-prior in BVAR models to alleviate poor estimation of drift parameters of the Traditional BVAR model. Chapter 3 deals with another possible explanation for the poor performance of the Traditional BVAR models in inflation forecasting. BVAR with Litterman???s prior have the disadvantage of a lack of robustness to deterministic shifts, exacerbated by the ill-determination of the intercept. Several structural break tests show that Australian inflation has breaks in the mean. Chapter 3 uses the Kalman filter to allow parameters to vary over time. The novelty of this chapter is modifying the standard BVAR model, where deterministic components evolve over time. Moreover, this chapter set aside the assumption of diagonality in the prior variance-covariance. Hence, another novelty of this chapter is using a BVAR model with modified non-diagonal variance-covariance matrix similar to the g-prior, where the deterministic components are the only source of variation, to forecast Australian inflation. Chapter 4 moves onto DSGE models and estimates a partially microfunded small-open economy (SOE) New-Keynesian model of the Australian economy. In this chapter, structural parameters of the rest of world (ROW), SOE, and closed economy, are estimated using Australian data as the small economy, and the US as the ROW, with the full information maximum likelihood.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Macroeconomics</field><field name="subject">Macroeconomics -- Forecasting</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intersemiosis in film: a metafunctional and multimodal exploration of colour and sound in the films of Wong Kar-Wai</field><field name="creator">Pun, Betty Oi-Kei, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study explores two stylistic features in the films of contemporary Hong Kong film-maker Wong Kar-Wai: colour and sound. In particular, it focuses on how transitions in colour palettes (e.g. from a natural colour spectrum to a monochromatic effect of black-and-white) and specific sound resources (such as silence) function as important semiotic resources in the films, even when they appear to create a disjunctive effect. The study draws on two perspectives on communication to explore film. The first is the metafunctional hypothesis of Systemic-Functional Linguistics, which theorises that the communicative dimensions of texts can be explored from three simultaneous ???macro-functions???: the ideational, the interpersonal and the textual metafunction. The second is multimodal communication, which stresses that multiple semiotic resources are used for meaning-making purposes and that meanings created multimodally are multiplicative in essence. From this theoretical basis the study aims to illuminate two inter-related objectives. First, that the meaning potentials of colour transition and sound are construed and enabled by the co-ordinations of meanings across different co-present semiotic resources ??? known as intersemiosis in the study. Second, that the semiotic capacities of the two resources can be usefully explored from a functional perspective. Drawing especially the notions of intersemiosis and resemiotisation the study shows that colour transition and sound are multivalent resources in Wong???s films. In other words, their meaning potentials are metafunctionally complex and are never static. The thesis argues that colour transition and sound should not be seen as having ???a??? meaning, but rather, that it is the semiotic complexities among the co-patterned resources that shape the meaning-making potential of the resources, and in turn, help contribute meaning potentials to the films.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wong, Kar-Wai</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of linoleate on insulin action in skeletal muscle cells</field><field name="creator">Cazzolli, Rosanna, St Vincents Campus, UNSW</field><field name="description">Emerging evidence suggests that an important mechanism for the negative feedback control of insulin signalling involves the inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by its prior serine/threonine (ser/thr) phosphorylation. IRS-1 ser/thr phosphorylation has been linked to the dissociation of IRS-1 from the insulin receptor and PI3K, and its degradation via a proteasome-dependent pathway. Studies in animal models have shown that increases in plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) are associated with reduced IRS-1-signalling, and so it has been postulated that elevated FFA cause insulin resistance by activating pathways that negatively regulate insulin action, including hyper-phosphorylation of ser/thr residues in IRS-1. We have shown that in the case of linoleate-induced insulin resistance in L6 rat skeletal muscle cells, the inhibition of IRS-1-dependent signalling arises via effects on both the phosphorylation status and degradation of IRS-1, which are mediated, in part, by IKKb. In addition, the reduction of IRS-1 mRNA levels allude to transcriptional effects of linoleate treatment that also contribute to the observed reduction in the total levels of this protein. PtdOH, particularly dilinoleoyl PtdOH, was found to be significantly increased in linoleate treated L6 cells, and sufficient to induce at least some of the effects on insulin-signalling that are observed upon linoleate treatment. It is unlikely, however, that IKKb and PtdOH are components of the same inhibitory pathway, since inhibiting IKKb activity did not alleviate the effects of PtdOH on IRS-1 tyrosine (tyr) phosphorylation. Moreover, although an integral component of the mechanism by which linoleate induces insulin-resistance in L6 cells, it appears that restoring IRS-1 function in linoleate treated cells is not sufficient to reverse insulin resistance. Hence, we hypothesise that linoleate induces multiple inhibitory pathways in L6 cells, with at last two of these involving IKKb- and PtdOH-dependent inhibition of IRS-1 signalling, which act in parallel to reduce glucose disposal and cause insulin resistance in this model.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">insulin signalling</field><field name="subject">type 2 diabetes</field><field name="subject">linoleate</field><field name="subject">IRS-1</field><field name="subject">phosphatidic acid</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing Malaysian children???s motivation to learn music</field><field name="creator">Mohd. Ghazali, Ghaziah, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">Children???s  attitudes  towards  music  reflect  the  socializing  practices  of  their  family,  parents,  peers,  school,  and  the  society  in  which  they  live.   The  fact  that  the  Malaysian  school  system  has  offered  school  music  since  1983  with  very  few  attempts  to  understand  the  impact of  this  subject  among  the  children  themselves  highlights  the  need  for  investigations  which  can  clarify  the  extent  to  which  school  music  education  has  influenced  children???s  perceptions  of  learning  music.   The  purpose  of  this  dissertation  was  to  examine  the  personal  and  external  factors,  which  help  shape  Malaysian  children???s  valuing  for  the  formal  learning  of  music  both  in  and  out  of  school.   Surveys  of  1,060  primary  school  children  aged  9  to  12,  as  well  as  interviews  with  a  smaller  sample  of  music  learners,  were  undertaken  to  investigate  children???s  motivation  to  learn  music.  The  Expectancy???Value  theory  of  Jacquelynne  Eccles  and  Allan  Wigfield  acted  as  a  framework  to  investigate  motivational  constructs  dealing  with  ttainment,  intrinsic  interest,  and  utility  values,  in  addition  to  the  cost  factor  related  to  learning  music.   In  the  first  part  of  the  analyses,  survey  results  were  categorized  according  to  the  three  main  ethnic  groups  in  Malaysia,  subdivided  into  five  ethnic???religion  groups  (i.e.,  Malay  Muslims,  Chinese  Buddhists,  Chinese  Christians,  Indian  Hindus  and  Indian  Christians),  musical  experience  (learners,  non???learners  and  those  who  had  ceased  learning)  and  gender.   The  second  part  of  the  analyses  focused  on  the   responses  of  20  music  learners  in  order  to  enrich  the  data  obtained  in  the  first  part  of  the  analyses.  Results  revealed  that  most  children,  regardless  of  ethnicity,  were  intrinsically  motivated  to  learn  music  in  school.   Moderately  high  perceptions  of  enjoyment  and  interest,  as  well  as  recognition  for  music???s  utility  value  were  prominent  among  all  ethnic  groups.   However,  most  children,  regardless  of  ethnicity,  musical  experience  and  gender  did  not  perceive  learning  music  in  and  out  of  school  as  having  high  attainment  value,  with  a  majority  indicating  moderately  low  responses  for  the  importance  of  learning  music.   Differences  among  ethnic  groups  revealed  that  Chinese  and  Indian  children  perceived  the  utility  value  of  musical  training  mor  than  Malay  children,  who  were  also  more  inclined  to  perceive  learning  music  as  difficult  and  involving  more  cost.   Significant  differences  for  gender  also  revealed  that  girls  recognize  more  intrinsic  and  utility  value  of  learning  music  bothin  and  outside  school.   An  important  implication  arising  from  the  study  is  the  importance  of  music  advocacy  throughout  Malaysian  society.   This  thesis  asserts  the  right  of  all  Malaysian  children  to  have  access  to  a  quality  music  education  that  assists  in  developin  all  of  their  potentials.   However,  it  also  recognizes  that  a  great  deal  of  work  is  needed  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  discipline  of  music  is  more  highly  regardedwithin  all  sections  of  the  Malaysian  educational  system.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DNA hybridization biosensors based on long-range electron transfer</field><field name="creator">Wong, Elicia Leh See, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">For the successful detection of selected DNA sequences or mutated genes associated with human disease, there are several challenges that the current research aims to overcome - higher sensitivity, greater selectivity and rapid assaying time. An electrochemical device using redox-active intercalators to transduce DNA hybridization via long-range electron transfer is presented in this thesis which aims to address the above challenges. The DNA recognition interface is composed of thiolated single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) and a diluent component both of which are self-assembled onto a gold electrode. This project seeks to advance fundamental insight into issues that impact the structure and behavior of surface-immobilized DNA towards hybridization with target complementary ss-DNA. After the optimal conditions have been identified for the construction of a reproducible DNA recognition layer, a stepwise detection scheme using an anionic intercalator, as the redox molecule is introduced for the DNA transduction. The stepwise detection relies on the absence of any electrochemistry prior to DNA hybridization. Upon hybridization, the perfectly stacked DNA is capable of mediating the electrochemical oxidation and reduction of intercalated species and hence voltammetric peaks become evident. Although excellent selectivity towards single-base mismatch detection is achieved, this detection scheme has a high detection limit and slow assaying time. However, this is overcome by a novel in situ approach where the electrochemistry is performed in the presence of both complementary target DNA and intercalator. The effect of different DNA recognition interfaces on hybridization is also investigated using electrochemical and gravimetric techniques where the hybridization efficiency, kinetics and affinity constant of hybridization were assessed. These measurements showed that the length of the diluent layer has a large impact on the time taken to form a perfect duplex but no impact on the initial recognition of the target DNA by the immobilized probe DNA. Fundamental aspects of the DNA technology towards assaying small molecules which have binding affinity to DNA are also investigated. The probe ss-DNA sensing interface was found to be highly sensitive towards detection of Cd2+. The long-range electron transfer approach was also utilized in gaining more insight knowledge of the interaction of cisplatin, an anti-cancer drug with the DNA.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="subject">biosensors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22815</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The strategic use of prior-period benchmark disclosures in management earnings forecasts</field><field name="creator">Coulton, Jeffrey James, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">I investigate the way in which Australian managers issue their earnings forecasts, and the impact this has on the reaction of equity investors and security analysts. Using a sample of 233 management earnings forecasts issued from 1994 to 2001, I find that managers are more likely to issue earnings forecasts when they have bad earnings news than good earnings news. I find that a vast majority of forecasts are ???framed??? by the use of an accompanying earnings benchmark. Forecasts are issued with varying degrees of specificity (or precision) and also with variation in additional accompanying disclosures. Forecasts issued with negative framing (forecast earnings less than benchmark earnings) are more likely to be accompanied by statements about factors external to the firm in explaining performance, while forecasts issued with positive framing (forecast earnings greater than benchmark earnings) are more likely to be accompanied by additional verifiable forecasts of components of earnings. I find the market reaction to earnings forecasts released with positive framing is higher than for forecasts released with negative framing, after controlling for forecast news and other forecast properties. I also examine security analysts??? forecasts around the release of management earnings forecasts and find that after the release of a management earnings forecast, analyst activity increases, but that analysts??? forecasts become less accurate and more biased. Neither the extent of analyst activity nor changes in analysts??? forecast accuracy or bias is related to forecast framing.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Earnings forecasts</field><field name="subject">continuous disclosure</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sequence stratigraphy and structure of the tertiary limestones in the Gulf of Papua, Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Glenn Douglas, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A sequence stratigraphic study was conducted on the Mendi and Darai Limestone Megasequences in the foreland area of the Papuan Basin in Papuan New Guinea.  It involved the integrated use of seismic, wireline log, well core and cuttings, strontium isotope age and biostratigraphic data. This study enhanced the understanding of the structure, stratigraphy and depositional architecture of the limestones, and the morphology of the basin at the time of deposition.  The results of the study were integrated with published geological and tectonic models for the Papuan Basin to develop a consistent and coherent model for the depositional history of the limestones.  Eleven third-order sequences were delineated within the Mendi and Darai Limestone Megasequences.  Eight depositional facies were interpreted across these sequences, namely deep-shelf, shallow-shelf, backreef, reef, shoal, forereef, basin margin and submarine fan facies.  Each facies was differentiated according to seismic character and geometry, well core and cuttings descriptions, and its position in the depositional framework of the sequence.  Deposition of the Mendi Limestone Megasequence commenced in the Eocene in response to thermal subsidence and eustatic sea-level rise.  Sedimentation comprised open-marine, shallow-water, shelfal carbonates.  During the middle of the Oligocene, the carbonate shelf was exposed and eroded in response to the collision of the Australian and Pacific Plates, or a major global eustatic sea-level fall.  Sedimentation recommenced in the Late Oligocene, however, in response to renewed extensional faulting and subsidence associated with back-arc extension.  This marked the onset of deposition of the Darai Limestone Megasequence in the study area.  The KFZ, OFZ and Darai Fault were reactivated during this time, resulting in the oblique opening of the Omati Trough.  Sedimentation was initially restricted to the Omati Trough and comprised deep and shallow-marine shelfal carbonates.  By the Early Miocene, however, movement on the faults had ceased and an extensive carbonate platform had developed across the Gulf of Papua.  Carbonate reef growth commenced along topographic highs associated with the KFZ, and led to the establishment of a rimmed carbonate shelf margin.  Shallow to locally deeper-marine, shelfal carbonates were deposited on this shelf, and forereef, submarine fan and basin margin carbonates were deposited basinward of the shelf margin.  The Uramu High and parts of the Pasca High became submerged during this time and provided sites for pinnacle reef development.  During the middle of the Early Miocene, a major global eustatic sea-level fall or flexure of the Papuan Basin associated with Early Miocene ophiolite obduction subaerially exposed the carbonate shelf.  This resulted in submarine erosion of the forereef and basin margin sediments.  Towards the end of the Early Miocene, however, sedimentation recommenced.  Shallow-marine, undifferentiated wackestones and packstones were deposited on the shelf; forereef, submarine fan and basin margin sediments were deposited basinward of the shelf margin; and reef growth recommenced along the shelf margin and on the Pasca and Uramu Highs.  By the end of the Early Miocene, however, the pinnacle reef on the Pasca High had drowned.  During the middle of the Middle Miocene, subtle inversion associated with ophiolite obduction subaerially exposed the carbonate shelf, and resulted in submarine erosion of the forereef and basin margin sediments.  Sedimentation recommenced towards the end of the Middle Miocene, however, in response to eustatic sea-level rise and flexure of the crust associated with foreland basin development.  Shallow marine, undifferentiated wackestones, packstones and grainstones were deposited on the shelf; carbonate shoals were deposited along the shelf margin; and forereef, submarine fan and basin margin carbonates were deposited basinward of the shelf margin.  Carbonate production rapidly outpaced accommodation space on the shelf during this time, resulting in highstand shedding and the development of a large prograding submarine fan complex basinward of the shelf margin.  By the Late Miocene, carbonate deposition had ceased across the majority of the study area in response to a major global eustatic sea-level fall or inversion associated with terrain accreation events along the northern Papuan margin.  Minor carbonate deposition continued on parts of the Uramu High, however, until the middle of the Late Miocene.  During the latest Miocene, clastic sediments prograded across the carbonate shelf, infilling parts of the foreland basin.  Plio-Pleistocene compression resulted in inversion and erosion of the sedimentary package in the northwestern part of the study area.  In the southeastern part of the Papuan Basin, however, clastic sedimentation continued to the present day.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sequence stratigraphy; Papuan Basin; Darai Limestone; Mendi Limestone; strontium</field><field name="subject">Gulf of Papua</field><field name="subject">stratigraphic geology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel protein interactors of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor</field><field name="creator">de Bock, Charles Edo, St George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">The plasminogen activator (PA) system plays an important role in cell adhesion, migration and invasion, and may require the coordinated expression of various proteins. The human urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) receptor (uPAR) is a central protein component of the PA system. By binding its ligand uPA, uPAR can direct proteolysis of the extracellular matrix. Also, it is now apparent that uPAR can initiate proteolytic independent signal transduction to influence angiogenesis, inflammation, wound repair and tumour progression. To determine whether any novel proteins interacted with uPAR, a yeast two-hybrid screening analysis was undertaken using alternate uPAR domain constructs as baits. These included full-length three domain uPAR (uPAR-DIDIIDIII), two domain uPAR (uPAR-DIIDIII), and each individual uPAR domain (uPAR-DI, uPAR-DII and uPAR-DIII). A number of proteins were identified as putative candidate interactors for the alternate constructs, with two of special interest for uPAR-DIDIIDIII. These were the heat shock protein Mrj, and the extracellular matrix protein fibulin-2. The protein Mrj was shown to bind uPAR both in vitro and in vivo using GST-pull down and co-immunoprecipitation assays respectively. The GST-pull down assay identified the interaction between Mrj and uPAR dependent on the C-terminal domain of Mrj and DI of uPAR. Using in vivo co-immunoprecipitation analysis, Mrj also bound to uPAR. Preliminary data suggest the association between uPAR and Mrj may play a role in the regulation of apoptosis. In regard to the uPAR interactor of fibulin-2, a calcium dependent binding interaction with uPAR was identified using the GST-pull down assay. However due to the large molecular weight and stringent conditions needed to solubilise fibulin-2, it was not possible to co-immunoprecipitate both uPAR and fibulin-2. Together, the identification of both Mrj and fibulin-2 amongst other candidate interactors of uPAR presented here provides further insight into the intricate relationship between uPAR and other proteins which may influence a range of biological functions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">uPAR</field><field name="subject">yeast two-hybrid</field><field name="subject">Fibulin-2</field><field name="subject">Mrj</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Short-term and time-dependent flexural behaviour of steel fibre-reinforced reactive powder concrete</field><field name="creator">Warnock, Robyn Ellen, Civil &amp; Environmental, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an experimental and theoretical study of the material and structural behaviour of a Steel-Fibre reinforced Reactive Powder Concrete (SF-RPC). The experimental program consisted of three phases. Phase 1 involved the development of a design mix for use throughout the remainder of the study. Phase 2 consisted of an in-depth investigation into the material properties of the mix. The final phase of the experimental component was the testing of 16 plain and prestressed SF-RPC beams. Twelve beams were tested under short-term loading to determine their cracking and ultimate moment capacity. The remaining 4 beams were used to investigate the time-dependent flexural behaviour of prestressed SF-RPC slabs. The material properties were measured using a range of short-term tests and included the compressive and flexural behaviour, static chord modulus of elasticity and crack mouth opening. In addition to the short-term tests, investigation into the time-dependent material behaviour was undertaken and included the creep and shrinkage characteristics of the material. The response of the material to various curing conditions was also investigated. The structural behaviour investigated included the short-term flexural moment-curvature response and load-deflection behaviour of beams and slabs along with the crack patterns of both plain and prestressed SF-RPC members. In addition to the investigations into the short-term flexural behaviour, a study into the time-dependent flexural behaviour was also undertaken. There are currently 2 available models for predicting the flexural response of plain and prestressed RPC cross-sections. The analytical phase of this investigation involved an evaluation of these models. Based on the experimental findings and analysis, a modified model was proposed for calculating the short-term flexural behaviour of plain and prestressed SF-RPC beams. The applicability of an age-adjusted effective modulus method for calculating the time-dependent deformations of prestressed SF-RPC slabs under various levels of sustained loads was also evaluated and found to be adequate with minor refinements.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reactive powder concrete</field><field name="subject">steel-fibre reinforced concrete</field><field name="subject">flexural behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internal labour markets and human resource management in an international investment banking institution : deal makers in the global economy</field><field name="creator">Royal, Carol, School of Industrial Relations &amp; Organisational Behaviour, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the continuing significance of the internal labour market construct for shaping human resource management practices in an international investment banking organisation. By adopting a historical perspective this study departs from existing literature and presents new explanations for understanding internal labour market theory in the investment banking industry. It also adds to existing scholarship on labour markets by considering more human resources indicators than have been previously used to differentiate labour market types. A range of approaches have been adopted. The BZW/ ABN AMRO case study has been investigated using both qualitative and quantitative methods and longitudinal and cross-sectional data. The theoretical framework elaborated has two dimensions. The first involves a model which highlights the importance of the organisational historical context for analysing the origins and functions of internal labour markets. It draws attention to certain recurring interrelated features that ultimately result in the adoption of internalised market arrangements. This aspect of the model also highlights the importance of emerging patterns in internal labour market structures that become evident over time. The second part of the framework involves a typology that establishes the existence of three different labour market types. The study revealed that a historical perspective is extremely valuable for understanding the origins and functions of internal labour markets, and for identifying two internal labour market types, the firm and occupational internal labour market types and also the occupational labour market type or external labour market. It was concluded that despite the claim made by various scholars that internal labour market arrangements are in decline, the dramatic changes experienced by the investment banking industry have proven that these arrangements are very resilient.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Investment banking</field><field name="subject">labor market</field><field name="subject">personnel management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dialogue: Hobbes and his perception of the role and development of the common law</field><field name="creator">Milgate, Michael Andrew, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis has three parts. The purpose of the first part is to analyse the origin, general characteristics, context and meaning of A Dialogue. I also include a history of the editions of this work, and a discussion on how the scholars have understood it. My intention is to explore the possibility of adding to their comments some additional reasons for Hobbes??? intentions in writing A Dialogue. In order to do all this, I have to take into account two main questions: ??? First, the relation between Hobbes (his life, ideas, aspirations, enemies) and A Dialogue; and ??? Second, the specific problem posed to Hobbes by common law. These issues correspond to the three chapters of Part One of the thesis. The second part of the thesis is divided into nine chapters; it analysis the content of A Dialogue section by section, trying to explain Hobbes??? interpretation of English law and legal history. According to Hobbes, an analysis of the rational principles expressed by both common and civil (Roman) law in England shows the indivisible nature of sovereignty. History, supposedly, confirms this. In the third part of the thesis I locate Hobbes??? legal philosophy as a science, according to the same deductive principles, which he states, are applied to geometry. Hobbes intends to make jurisprudence a form of scientific knowledge to reinforce the idea that sovereignty cannot be shared. While pursuing this philosophical enterprise, Hobbes wants to square his science of politics with English legal history. Hobbes argues that in England, except for the period during the civil wars, there has always been only one absolute ruler of the country. By taking this stand, Hobbes, indirectly calls for changes in the English constitutional order, to be made by advocating the authority of the past, and not only by advocating the application of reason.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">common law</field><field name="subject">Thomas Hobbes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ion exchange equilibria of the gold cyanide complex in aqueous and mixed solvent environments</field><field name="creator">Jayasinghe, Nivari, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Ion exchange equilibria are presented for [ ]??? ??? Au(CN)2 / Cl , [ ]??? ??? Au(CN)2 / SCN and SCN??? / Cl??? in aqueous solution, and in various mixed solvents, at 303K using Purolite A500 as the ion-exchanger. The mixed solvents investigated include water-acetone, water-dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and water-N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). In aqueous solution, the selectivity of Purolite A500 for a given anion increases in the order: [ ]??? ??? &amp;lt ??? &amp;lt Cl SCN Au(CN)2 . This selectivity sequence confirms the high affinity of the ion exchange resin for the [ ]??? Au(CN)2 species. In mixed solvents, however, the selectivity of Purolite A500 for [ ]??? Au(CN)2 decreases with an increase in the composition of the organic solvent in the external solution. Mixed solvents containing greater than 60 mol% organic solvent are preferred for the displacement of [ ]??? Au(CN)2 from the resin. The effectiveness of a given type of mixed solvent generally increases in the following order: DMSO &amp;it acetone &amp;it NMP. The ion exchange equilibria are correlated using the Law of Mass Action, modified with activity coefficients, to determine the equilibrium constant for each binary system. The fitted values of the equilibrium constants are consistent with the trends observed in the ion exchange isotherms. The accuracy of the correlation results in the mixed solvent systems range from 1 to 10% and this is similar to the level of accuracy obtained for the ion exchange equilibria in aqueous solution. From these results it can be concluded that the Law of Mass Action is equally valid in mixed solvent systems. The variation in the equilibrium constant with mixed solvent composition, for a given binary system, correlates well with the dielectric constant of the mixed solvent. For a given value of the dielectric constant, however, the equilibrium constant, however, the equilibrium constant is dependent on the type of mixed solvent. A fundamental relationship is derived between the equilibrium constants and the Gibbs energies of transfer associated with the solvation of the ions in the mixed solvents. Based on this relationship, the redistribution of ions between the pore solution and the bulk mixed solvent, appears to be the most significant factor that governs the selectivity of the resin in mixed solvent systems.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gold</field><field name="subject">cyanide proces</field><field name="subject">ion exchange resins</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the externalities of reconstruction projects in neighbourhood residential markets</field><field name="creator">Kim, Jong Jin, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">Externalities are defined as situations where an economic activity of an economic subject affects the production or consumption activities of other economic subjects (third parties), that do not participate in the activity. Externalities therefore cause changes in the welfare state of third party subjects and result in an economic inefficiency in an economy, indicating that the economy does not enjoy the maximum benefits from its given resources. Reconstruction project is a kind of large scale residential renewal programs that is organized and undertaken by private sector in Korea. In the process of profit maximization in the private sector, old housing estates are reconstructed with higher and larger residential buildings, as well as more dwelling units on the same sites. These changes emit externalities into the neighbourhood residential markets. The aim of the study is to demonstrate, statistically, the creation of externalities in the reconstruction of old housing estate. In doing so, the study investigates the differences of land prices in the neighbourhood residential markets due to the externalities generated by the projects and quantifies the differences, using the land price data from the Ministry of Construction and Transportation in Korea. Three statistical analysis methods were used in the study. Firstly, descriptive statistic detected the differences of land prices between the residential markets in each project case and indicated the existence of the externalities in some of the neighbourhood residential markets. Secondly, ANOVA and T-tests statistically concluded that reconstruction projects emit externalities in some neighbourhood residential markets. Lastly, the intervention analysis quantified the amounts of the externalities and verified the established hypotheses. The major finding of the study is that reconstruction projects emit externalities in the neighbourhood residential markets, and the net externalities are, on the whole, positive. It is concluded that the general welfare could be extended as the production level of reconstruction projects is increased.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urban renewal</field><field name="subject">housing</field><field name="subject">Korea</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical and experimental study of energy selective contacts for hot carrier solar cells and extensions to tandem cells</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Chu-Wei, School of Photovoltaic Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Photovoltaics is currently the fastest growing energy source in the world. Increasing the conversion efficiency towards the thermodynamic limits is the trend in research development. ???Third generation??? photovoltaics involves the investigation of ideas that may achieve this goal. Among the third generation concepts, the tandem cell structure has experimentally proven to have conversion efficiencies higher than a standard p-n junction solar cell. The alternative hot carrier solar cell design is one of the most elegant approaches. Energy selective contacts are crucial elements for the operation of hot carrier solar cells. Besides the carrier cooling problem within the absorber, carrier extraction has to be done through a narrow range of energy to minimise the interaction between the hot carriers in the absorber and the cooler carriers in the contacts. Resonant tunnelling through localised states, such as associated with atomic defects or with quantum dots in a dielectric matrix, may provide the required energy selectivity. A new model in studying the properties of resonant tunnelling through defects in an insulator is proposed and investigated. The resulting calculations are simple and useful in obtaining physical insight into the underlying tunneling processes. It is found that defects having a normal distribution along the tunnelling direction do not reduce the transmission coefficient dramatically, which increases the engineering prospects for fabrication. Silicon quantum dots embedded in an oxide provide the required deep energy confinement for room temperature resonant tunnelling operation. A single layer of silicon quantum dots in the centre of an oxide matrix are prepared by RF magnetron sputtering. The method has the advantage of controlling the dot size and the dot spatial position along the tunnelling direction. The presence of these crystalline silicon dots in the oxide is confirmed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). A negative-differential resistance characteristic has been measured at room temperature on such structures fabricated on an N-type degenerated silicon wafer, a feature that can be explained by the desired resonant tunnelling process. A silicon quantum dot superlattice can be made by stacking multiple layers of silicon quantum dots. A model is proposed for calculating the band structure of such a silicon quantum dot superlattice, with the anisotropic silicon effective mass being taken into account. It suggests a high density of silicon quantum dots in a carbide matrix may provide the bandgap and required mobility for the top cell in the stacks for the recently proposed all-silicon tandem solar cell. The resonant tunnelling modeling and silicon quantum dot experiments developed have demonstrated new results relevant to energy selective contacts for hot carrier solar cells. Building on this work, the modeling study on silicon quantum dots may provide the theoretical basis for bandgap engineering of all-silicon tandem cells.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">solar cells</field><field name="subject">photovoltaic cells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23065</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Burgertum ohne Raum :German liberalism and imperialism, 1848-1884, 1918-1943</field><field name="creator">Fitzpatrick, Matthew P., School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis situates the emergence of German imperialist theory and praxis during the nineteenth century within the context of the ascendancy of German liberalism. It also contends that imperialism was an integral part of a liberal sense of German national identity. It is divided into an introduction, four parts and a set of conclusions. The introduction is a methodological and theoretical orientation. It offers an historiographical overview and places the thesis within the broader historiographical context. It also discusses the utility of post-colonial theory and various theories of nationalism and nation-building. Part One examines the emergence of expansionism within liberal circles prior to and during the period of 1848/ 49. It examines the consolidation of expansionist theory and political practice, particularly as exemplified in the Frankfurt National Assembly and the works of Friedrich List. Part Two examines the persistence of imperialist theorising and praxis in the post-revolutionary era. It scrutinises the role of liberal associations, civil society, the press and the private sector in maintaining expansionist energies up until the 1884 decision to establish state-protected colonies. Part Three focuses on the cultural transmission of imperialist values through the sciences, media and fiction. In examines in particular the role of geographical journals and societies and of the periodical Die Gartenlaube. Part Four discusses the post World War I era, and examines liberal attempts to revive German imperialism, within the context of a refusal to accept the Versailles settlement. It also delineates points of convergence and divergence between Nazi and liberal imperialisms. This is followed by a summation of the evidence and arguments, in which it is concluded that the liberal narration of German national identity was predicated both on the objectification of colonised lands and attempts to emulate and ultimately rival British imperial power.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Germany</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">liberalism</field><field name="subject">imperialism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23083</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Settlement of generalist marine invertebrate herbivores in response to bacterial biofilms and other cues</field><field name="creator">Huggett, Megan Jane, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Most marine invertebrates have a complex life cycle involving a benthic adult phase, and a planktonic larval phase. The process whereby tiny larvae are able to locate, settle and metamorphose in a habitat where juveniles are then capable of successfully establishing themselves is a key stage in the life cycle and a central theme of current marine research. Bacterial biofilms are an important settlement cue for many larvae, and it appears that particular strains within environmental communities may be responsible for the inducing ability of some biofilms. The focus of this thesis is the importance of biofilms for larval settlement of the blacklip abalone Haliotis rubra and the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma. Larval development of the sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii was also examined, but this species was problematic for a larval settlement study. H. rubra larval settlement occurred in response to several macroalgal species. Biofilmed (but otherwise abiotic) surfaces did not induce settlement of H. rubra larvae and reduction of surface films of bacteria and diatoms on inducing algae did not reduce the settlement response. Macroalgae, particularly green algal species, may play an important role in the recruitment of H. rubra larvae in the field and can be used to induce settlement in hatcheries. H. erythrogramma settled in response to a range of surfaces with highest settlement on coralline algae. Settlement was reduced by autoclaving plants and treating plants with antibiotics. Molecular and culture based analysis revealed a shift in microbial community structure between plants treated with antibiotics and unmanipulated plants. Many bacterial strains, dominated by the genera Pseudoalteromonas, Shewanella and Vibrio, induced larval settlement. Three probes targeting Pseudoalteromonas, Shewanella and Vibrio were developed for CARD-FISH, enabling quantification of these genera in biofilms on algae. The three genera were found in highest numbers on coralline algae and in variable numbers on the surfaces of other algae. Recruitment of H. erythrogramma also occurs in highest numbers on coralline algae, and in low amounts on co-occurring algae. This is the first example demonstrating that bacteria that induce settlement in the laboratory are also present in the juvenile recruitment habitat.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biofilms</field><field name="subject">bacteria</field><field name="subject">marine invertebrates</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multisite rainfall stochastic downscaling for climate change impact assessment</field><field name="creator">Mehrotra, Rajeshwar, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the development and application of a downscaling framework for multi site simulation of daily rainfall. The rainfall simulation is achieved in two stages. First, rainfall occurrences at multiple sites are downscaled, which is followed by the generation of daily rainfall amounts at each site identified as wet. A continuous weather state based nonparametric downscaling model conditional on atmospheric predictors and a previous day average rainfall state is developed for simulation of multi site rainfall occurrences. A nonparametric kernel density approach is used for simulation of rainfall amounts at individual sites conditional on atmospheric variables and the previous day rainfall amount. The proposed model maintains spatial correlation of rainfall occurrences by simulating concurrently at all stations and of amounts by using random innovations that are spatially correlated yet serially independent. Temporal dependence is reproduced in the occurrence series by conditioning on previous day average wetness fraction and assuming the weather states to be Markovian, and in the amount series by conditioning on the previous day rainfall amount. The seasonal transition is maintained by simulating rainfall on a day-to-day basis using a moving window formulation. The developed downscaling framework is calibrated using the relevant atmospheric variables and rainfall records of 30 stations around Sydney, Australia. Results indicate a better representation of the spatio-temporal structure of the observed rainfall as compared to existing alternatives. Subsequently, the framework is applied to predict plausible changes in rainfall in warmer conditions using the same set of atmospheric variables for future climate obtained as a General Circulation Model simulation. While the case studies presented are restricted to a specific region, the downscaling model is designed to be useful in any generic catchment modelling and management activity and/or for investigating possible changes that might be experienced by hydrological, agricultural and ecological systems in future climates.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rain and rainfall</field><field name="subject">downscaling</field><field name="subject">climatic changes</field><field name="subject">computer simulation</field><field name="subject">multisite stochastic downscaling</field><field name="subject">weather states</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post traumatic stress disorder among people with heroin dependence</field><field name="creator">Mills, Katherine, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Comorbidity between substance use disorders and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common. Despite evidence to suggest that people with heroin dependence are at particular risk of PTSD, there is a dearth of research focussing on the interrelationship between these disorders. The present thesis aims to identify the prevalence of PTSD among people with heroin dependence, the correlates of this comorbidity, and its impact on treatment outcomes, the utilisation of treatment services, and treatment costs. Study 1 examines the epidemiology of PTSD and heroin dependence among 10,641 Australian adults who participated in the National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing. The prevalence of PTSD was highest among people with heroin or other opioid use disorders compared with any other drug class (33.2%). Comorbid PTSD was associated with poorer occupational functioning, and poorer physical and mental health. While general population studies provide crucial population estimates they do not allow for a detailed examination of the relationship between highly disabling but low prevalence disorders. The remaining studies were undertaken using a sample of 615 treatment seeking and non-treatment seeking dependent heroin users. Study 2 examines the prevalence and correlates of this comorbidity. PTSD was common (lifetime 41%; current 31%) and was associated with a more severe clinical profile.  Studies 3 and 4 were based on follow-up data on this large cohort. Study 3 is the first study to examine the impact of PTSD on 2 year treatment outcomes for heroin dependence. Across the 2 year period, those with current PTSD at baseline performed more poorly in terms of their occupational functioning, physical and mental health. Study 4 found that this did not equate to the greater use of treatment services or an increased cost to the health care system among those with PTSD. It is concluded that PTSD and heroin dependence are highly comorbid conditions, and that this comorbidity is associated with poorer functioning and poorer treatment outcomes. Individuals entering treatment for heroin dependence should be assessed for PTSD so that they may receive appropriate treatment and referral. Further research is also needed to determine how best to treat this comorbidity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Post traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">heroin dependence</field><field name="subject">treatment outcome</field><field name="subject">epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of polyethylene wear debris and oestrogen deficiency on fracture healing in a rodent model</field><field name="creator">Rajaratnam, Rema Antonette, Prince of Wales Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Patients who suffer from severe joint destruction caused by arthritis often undergo total joint arthroplasty (TJA). A major limitation of this treatment and common long-term complication is the development of aseptic loosening of the prosthesis in as many as 20% of patients. The current paradigm to explain aseptic loosening proposes that wear debris generated from the prosthesis initiates a macrophage-mediated inflammatory response by resident macrophages, leading to osteoclast activation and bone resorption at the implant interface. This can then lead to the development of a peri-prosthetic fracture. The principal aim of fracture healing is to restore the bone to its original form and strength. However, this ultimate goal can be altered if the healing is impaired. This impairment may be due to bone disease (osteoporosis) or even the introduction of a foreign material such as PE wear debris that could have migrated from the articulating surface to the fracture site. A standard closed unilateral fracture of the right femur was performed in both normal and oestrogen deficient rats following fixation with a k-wire. Ceridust (PE wear debris) was combined with hyaluronic acid and saline and injected directly into the fracture site. Femurs were assessed using radiographs, histology and immunohistochemistry. Histological analysis revealed that complete remodelling was achieved in all control groups by 6 weeks post-fracture with mechanical strength returning to normal values. The mechanical properties of the fractures were not influenced by the presence of PE wear debris in the dose and timing examined. Histology and immunohistochemistry however, did reveal a local effect of the presence of PE wear debris. The histology adjacent to the PE particles was inferior to the controls but did not manifest itself in a reduction in the mechanical properties except in the oestrogen deficient bone at 6 weeks post-fracture. The levels of MMP-1 and TNF-?? correlated to the presence of PE particles. In this thesis, I have shown the mechanism by which bone remodelling in fracture healing could be retarded due to the presence of PE wear debris, by increased matrix degradation in both normal and oestrogen deficient animals.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">estrogen</field><field name="subject">wound healing</field><field name="subject">biomedical materials</field><field name="subject">artificial implants</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hope and abundance: the counter globalisation movement as multitude ??? breaking the logic of pathological modernity</field><field name="creator">Arvanitakis, James, History of Philosophy &amp; Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Using the theoretical work of Hardt and Negri???s Empire and Beck???s Risk Society, I define current experiences of modernity as ???pathological???. The term ???pathological modernity??? is used because it portrays a modernity dominated by ???spirals of crisis??? that are aggravated by the solutions proposed to solve them. Like the ???war on terror??? and environmental degradation, I argue that many crises facing the world today reflect the characteristics of capital as they globalised, branded, hybridised, boundless and endless.  ???Pathological modernity??? has various dimensions including a Cartesian logic underscored by an ???eternal truth???, free-market fundamentalism, certainty in decision making, and a scientism which believes all  challenges can be overcome. Additional dimensions include an operational form of biopower, pathological reflexivity, and a frontier disposition that continually encloses non-commodified spaces (or commons) creating a crisis of scarcity.  Despite its dominance, pathological modernity is being challenged on many fronts. Amongst these is the ???counter-globalisation??? movement (CGM). A heterogenous movement, it represents a qualitatively different form of globalisation and logic that brings it into conflict with pathological modernity.  Using participatory research I investigate this movement grounding it within Hardt and Negri???s (2004) ???multitude???. Extending Hardt and Negri???s descriptions, I propose that the multitude ???works in common??? to establish new commons in both the physical and cultural spheres. Concentrating on the ???cultural commons??? I argue that these represent a new form of biopolitics and promote abundance where scarcity once existed. The four cultural commons identified are hope, trust, safety and intellect. Based on the work of Marcel Mauss, I argue that the reciprocal, free and open exchange and sharing of these cultural commons creates ???authentic??? communities based on openness, alterity and abundance. While the CGM works to establish new commons, pathological modernity encloses and commodifies them, turning hope into material aspirations; trust into anxiety; safety into security; and intellect into intellectual property.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="subject">Empire</field><field name="subject">commons</field><field name="subject">multitude</field><field name="subject">hope</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding viral-immune dynamics in HIV infection</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Lei, Centre for Vascular Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The HIV epidemic has caused a health crisis globally. Using mathematical and statistical tools, we have analysed and modelled data from animal models of HIV, HSV and influenza virus, in order to understand the role of neutralising antibodies (nAbs), CD4+ T cells, CTLs and APCs in HIV infection and the implications of this for HIV vaccine design. Our analysis suggests that antibody and CTL responses confer protection at different stages of HIV infection. Passive antibodies confer protection against SHIV89.6PD infection by either neutralising the initial viral inoculum or reducing the acute viral level and growth. Consequently, CD4+ T cell preservation allows the immune system to control long-term disease progression. Therefore, vaccines that elicit high nAb levels during early infection may induce sterilising immunity or delay disease progression. By contrast, we observed that vaccine-elicited CTLs did not proliferate until day 10 following SHIV89.6P infection. More potent CTL-inducing vaccines did not reduce this delay, but further increased it and reduced CTL growth. However, more potent vaccines result in better memory CTL formation, better CD4 preservation and improved disease outcome. HIV vaccine design should aim to reduce the delay in CTL activation. To further understand the pathogenesis of HIV, we investigated the relationship between viral load and CD4+ T cell levels using simple ODE models. Our results demonstrate a positive correlation between peak viral level and the acute CD4+ T cell depletion in SHIV89.6P infection, which demonstrates how reduction of peak viral level significantly preserves CD4+ T cells. Surprisingly, this relationship between virus and CD4+ T cells was reversed in SIVmac239 infection and other CCR5 tropic infections. Future work should focus on understanding this difference between X4 and R5 infections. Regardless of viral infections, antigen presentation is essential for stimulating effective immune responses. Our study on influenza and HSV-1 infections suggests that antigen loading rate of APCs determines the magnitude of antigen presentation and the APC decay is mainly due to the degradation of pMHC, not CTL killing. The slow kinetics of HIV viral growth may be one factor that limits the level of antigen presentation and subsequent CTL response.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Has resource allocation policy change improved equity? lessons from Ghana</field><field name="creator">Asante, Augustine Danso, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Equitable allocation of health care resources is crucial for promoting health equity. Since the emergence of the resource allocation working party (RAWP) formula nearly three decades ago, many countries have implemented resource allocation policy reforms aiming to improve equity. Little is known about whether, how and the extent to which, most of these policies have actually improved equity. This study examined whether, and the extent to which, decentralisation of health resource allocation decision-making in Ghana has improved equity in funding within regions and explored the factors that influenced the equitable allocation of resources for health care in Ghana. The study used a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods. Two of the ten regions in Ghana: Ashanti and Northern, covering the southern and northern sectors of the country, were purposefully selected. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to measure levels of relative deprivation of districts applied as a proxy of need. An equity-adjusted share index (EAS) was developed and used as a yardstick against which equity in funding was assessed. Factors influencing the equitable allocation of resources were explored qualitatively through open-ended interviews with policy makers and other health sector stakeholders. The study found that resource allocation in the Ashanti and Northern Regions were largely inequitable, in terms of differentially benefiting the most disadvantaged districts. The proportion of variance in the actual share of funds that could be explained by the predicted EAS was below 50% for all the years examined, except for the allocation of government funds to the Ashanti Region for 1999, where the proportion of variance was 56%. Resource allocation in the Northern Region favoured three urban districts over their rural counterparts. However, in the Ashanti Region, there was a significant shift in resources from richer to poorer districts from 2000 to 2002. The Kumasi Metro district, for example, saw its share of donor-pooled funds reduced drastically from 20% of the total budget in 2000 to 7.2% in 2001 and 5.6% in 2002. Key factors influencing resource allocation and equity included low funding of the health system, local capacity to utilise funds efficiently, manpower availability, politics, donor influence and the nature of collaboration with the local government. The study concluded that intra-regional resource allocation in Ghana???s Ashanti and Northern regions was less equitable than expected, despite efforts to redistribute funds. It recommended more effective mechanisms for promoting equity through intra-regional resource allocation in Ghana.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ghana</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">resource allocation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motor dysfunction in apparently normal high-risk children</field><field name="creator">Goyen, Traci-Anne, School of Women???s &amp; Children???s Health, UNSW</field><field name="description">Infants born extremely prematurely (ie. &amp;lt29 weeks gestation) or with extremely low birth weight (ie. &amp;lt1000 grams) are at high-risk of major and minor motor sequelae that persist into the school years. Most of the research on the outcome of these high-risk infants has concentrated on the prevalence of major disability. The majority of high-risk children at school age have normal intelligence and no sensorineural disability. Despite this, these ???apparently normal??? high-risk children have a higher incidence of minor morbidities. Motor coordination problems are frequently reported, yet further investigation into the emergence of minor motor dysfunction, or its impact on academic achievement and everyday activities is seldom explored. The aim of this thesis was to provide a comprehensive investigation into motor dysfunction, which is commonly found in ???apparently normal??? high-risk children. This was addressed in a series of five studies that intended to provide insight into the emergence, prevalence, nature, and prediction of motor dysfunction in otherwise ???normal??? high-risk children. Study 1 examined the development of gross and fine motor skills from infancy to school age using a longitudinal cohort study design. ???Apparently normal??? high-risk children (n=58) were assessed with the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales at 18 months corrected age, 3 and 5 years. A significant proportion continued to have fine motor deficits to school age (64%), reflecting a persistent problem with fine motor skills throughout this period. The proportion of infants with gross motor deficits significantly increased from 18 months to 5 years (81.1%), particularly for the ???micropreemies???. Whilst there was no gender difference found, the development of gross and fine motor skills appeared to be influenced differently by the home environment.  Study 2 examined the impact of motor dysfunction on performance at school age. The prevalence of Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) in ???apparently normal??? high-risk children was determined using a controlled cohort study design. In addition, the nature of DCD in this population was explored by testing sensorimotor abilities that possibly underlie the motor dysfunction. Fifty (50) high-risk children with IQ&amp;lt85 and no identified sensorineural disability were assessed at 8 years of age along with a matched control from their respective class at school. The Movement Assessment Battery for Children and a battery of sensorimotor tests were administered. Results indicated a significantly higher prevalence of DCD (42%) in the high-risk group in comparison to the control group (8%). In relation to sensorimotor abilities that may influence motor performance, the high-risk group scored significantly lower on most of tests, however it was neurological ???soft signs???, postural praxis, and sequencing praxis that contributed to DCD in the high-risk group. Study 3 was designed to investigate the impact of motor dysfunction on a motor-based task performed within the school setting. Specifically, this study described handwriting skills in ???apparently normal??? high-risk children, determined the prevalence of handwriting dysfunction, and investigated sensorimotor abilities that may be associated with problematic handwriting. The high-risk cohort and matched controls described in study 2 were also administered a number of handwriting tests. High-risk children were found to have poorer handwriting legibility and speed in comparison to their classmates. The prevalence of handwriting dysfunction in the high-risk group was 46%, significantly higher than controls (18%). Hand preference, pencil grasp used, and pain whilst writing were comparable to the control group. The contribution of underlying sensorimotor abilities to handwriting dysfunction in the high-risk population however was not evident. By using the same subjects in studies 2 and 3, the co-morbidity of handwriting dysfunction with DCD could be determined. Of those high-risk children identified with DCD, 43% had co-morbid handwriting dysfunction.  Study 4 explored the relationship between perinatal and environmental variables to Developmental Coordination Disorder and handwriting dysfunction in high-risk children. Perinatal and environmental variables of the 50 ???apparently normal??? high-risk children that participated in the previous study were analysed. Results indicated prolonged rupture of membranes (PROM) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) were significantly and independently associated with DCD, perhaps reflecting the impact of the antenatal infection process and visual development related to ROP on motor outcome in high-risk children. Perinatal variables were not associated with handwriting dysfunction, but high-risk males were more likely to have handwriting dysfunction. Maternal education and paternal occupation were associated with aspects of handwriting. Whilst handwriting is a motor-based activity, it appears to be influenced by environmental variables, similar to other academic areas for the high-risk population. Study 5 sought to determine whether a motor assessment at an earlier age could predict DCD in the ???apparently normal??? high-risk population at school age. Motor assessment at 12 months, 3 and 5 years for the high-risk subjects who participated in study 2 were analysed using Receiver Operator Curves (ROC curves). The 3 year assessment with the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales was the best predictor of DCD at 8 years, with the Griffiths Locomotor Scale at 3 years yielding a similar result. Findings suggest that high-risk children who scored below the specified cut-off points on 3 year motor assessments and who had a history of PROM or ROP were at greater risk of having motor-based problems that had the potential to interfere with functioning at school.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">infants (premature)</field><field name="subject">motor ability in children</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in bipolar disorder</field><field name="creator">Malhi, Gurjhinder Singh, Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Aim To determine the neural correlates of Bipolar Disorder (BD) using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in different phases of the illness.  Methods Five fMRI studies were conducted in adult female BD patients and healthy matched comparison subjects. The first two studies examined patients with bipolar depression and hypomania using captioned-pictures to characterize mood-state related patterns of activation. The subsequent three studies investigated BD euthymia using emotional words and faces to identify a potential trait-marker. Results During depression, bipolar patients demonstrated additional subcortical activation in the thalamus, amygdala, hypothalamus and medial globus pallidus. In hypomania, patients again had additional subcortical activation involving the caudate and the thalamus. In both studies patients had prefrontal cortex activation, but the pattern differed from that in healthy subjects.  These studies suggested a pattern of mood-state related subcortical recruitment for emotional processing in BD.  The next set of studies examined euthymic BD patients to partition trait and state-markers. The first study used implicit positive and negative word-associated affect and found diminished responses to positive and negative affective words as compared to healthy subjects in both cortical and subcortical brain regions, in particular the cingulate, thalamus and caudate. The second study used the emotional Stroop task to elicit implicit affective processing and euthymic patients had less cortical and subcortical activation in response to affect, in particular decreased left ventral prefrontal cortex (BA47) activation. The final study used explicit emotional processing of fear and disgust to examine affective responses, and showed that patients were generally less responsive to disgust, but had comparatively greater activations to fear. Conclusions BD patients have a likely deficit in the ventral prefrontal cortex that is evident in euthymia. Prefrontal cognitive appraisal of emotions is constrained in euthymic, depressed and hypomanic phases, reflected in subcortical changes that suggest additional processing. The likely cause for this is a functional prefrontal cortex deficit that results in compensatory changes in emotional processing systems. Treatment probably stabilizes these systems without normalizing them. Our studies demonstrate the benefits of examining BD in its different phases, and future studies should attempt to emulate this in medication-free patients.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bipolar disorder</field><field name="subject">fMRI</field><field name="subject">manic-depressive illness</field><field name="subject">magnetic resonance imaging</field><field name="subject">neuroanatomy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23299</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women and modernity in interior design: a legacy of design in Sydney, Australia from the 1920s to the 1960s</field><field name="creator">Morrow, Carol A., Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that women were seminal to the development of interior design as a discipline and profession in Sydney, Australia. Covering the period from the 1920s to the 1960s, this study identifies Thea Proctor, Nora McDougall, Margaret Lord, Phyllis Shillito and Mary White as foundational leaders who progressively advanced interior design in Sydney through individual and collective understandings of design. Focussing on their contributions to this development, this study explains complex interrelationships between women and modernity in interior design. This emergence of the discipline and profession in Sydney situates the initiatives of these five women at a transitional phase of the field???s global development when ???interior decoration??? is challenged by modern attitudes and artistic theories of ???design???. Working as individuals, Proctor and her successors advance the profession???previously characterised as a ???natural??? pursuit for women of ???taste??? and ???style??????by their artistic, rational and practical approaches to interior design. At a time when no distinct discipline exists in Sydney, the women offer instruction and forge new directions by reformulating previous overseas traditions: incorporating a wide-range of aesthetic and theoretical conceptions of design, demonstrating common and different approaches to practice, and integrating changes in requisite knowledge and skills in response to their times. The women???s programs are conventional and progressive, common and diverse, universal and particular in content and meaning. Working within a variety of settings, the women importantly establish professional jurisdiction situating interior design in a modernist context. Significantly, their contributions challenge past readings that have diminished the early women of interior design, and at the same time, embody all the conflicts, ruptures, paradoxes and contradictions that are cental to modernity. This research redresses the lack of institutional history of interior design in Sydney and links theories of modernism and modernity to issues of gender and profession to explain the women???s significant contributions to interior design at a critical juncture of the field???s development. As such, their stories and legacy of design in Sydney contribute to a wider picture of women and modernity in interior design.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interior decoration</field><field name="subject">women interior decorators</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">International finance: issues related to law and financial development</field><field name="creator">Wu, Qiongbing, The school of banking &amp; finance, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines three distinctive issues that concern the regulators and policy makers in the development of financial markets. It contains three stand-alone research projects within the context of law, finance and economic growth. Chapter 2 examines the dynamic relationship between banks and economic growth from the points of view of market efficiency and asset pricing theory. Publicly traded banks are broadly representative of a country???s banking sector, so that banking industry stock prices will broadly reflect the performance of a country???s banking sector. Because previous research has established that the institutional framework, as well as the aggregate size, of the banking sector can significantly affect economic growth, this chapter investigates whether the stock returns on a country???s banking sector contain information about future economic growth, and whether the specific country and institutional characteristics that affect the functioning of the banking system and market efficiency also influence this relationship. Using the data from 18 developed and 18 emerging markets, the chapter finds a significant and positive relationship between bank excess return and future economic growth in both the time-series and panel analyses. The chapter also finds that this positive relationship is significantly strengthened by the enforcement of insider trading law, by banking crises, by bank disclosure regulations and financial development, but is weakened by government ownership of banks. Chapter 3 investigates the role of bank idiosyncratic volatility in economic growth and systemic banking crises. Using the same dataset from Chapter 2, this chapter finds an ambiguous relationship between bank volatility and economic growth in the time-series studies, which suggests that the effect of bank volatility on economic growth is more country-specific. In the panel analyses, the chapter finds a negative but very weak relationship between bank volatility and future economic growth. This negative relationship is magnified by banking crises and bank disclosure standards, but is alleviated by the government ownership of banks, the enforcement of insider trading law and financial development. The chapter goes further to examine whether bank volatility leads to the occurrence of systemic banking crises, and finds that the marginal effect of bank volatility on the probability of banking crises is very weak for the sample of all markets, and this result is mainly driven by the data from the emerging markets. However, bank volatility is a significant predictor of banking crises even after being controlled for macroeconomic indicators, which implies that market forces are more powerful in promoting the soundness of the banking system in developed markets. We also find that those macroeconomic and banking risk management indicators have different impacts on the probability of banking crises for the emerging and developed markets. Therefore, caution needs to be taken in interpreting the cross-country results of the studies on banking crises. Chapter 4 studies the corporate governance issues in China, a significant developing country that has been neglected by the current law and finance literature. Incorporated with the legal environment and ownership structure of China???s listed companies, the chapter develops a simple game model to study a neglected aspect of current corporate governance literature: the expropriation arising from the mixture of weak investor protection, ownership concentration coexisting with ownership dispersion, and the absence of a controlling shareholder. The last two chapters find that government ownership undermines the positive link between bank excess return and economic growth, but alleviates the negative impact of bank volatility on growth as well. This chapter shows that government ownership is also a two-edged sword in corporate governance in China: it leads to a double-agency problem; however, the strong legal protection of State assets also increases the cost of expropriation. Using the data from 1996 to 2003, the chapter finds the empirical evidence consistent with the model. By analysing the puzzles in China???s stock market, the chapter suggests that improving the legal protection of investors is the key issue in the future development of the financial market.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">banks and banking</field><field name="subject">financial development</field><field name="subject">economic growth</field><field name="subject">market efficiency</field><field name="subject">law and finance</field><field name="subject">corporate governance</field><field name="subject">investor proctection</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">international finance.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A quality-driven decision-support framework for architecting e-business applications</field><field name="creator">Al-Naeem, Tariq Abdullah, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Architecting e-business applications is a complex design activity. This is mainly due to the numerous architectural decisions to be made, including the selection of alternative technologies, software components, design strategies, patterns, standards, protocols, platforms, etc. Further complexities arise due to the fact that these alternatives often vary considerably in their support for different quality attributes. Moreover, there are often different groups of stakeholders involved, with each having their own quality goals and criteria. Furthermore, different architectural decisions often include interdependent alternatives, where the selection of one alternative for one particular decision impacts the selections to be made for alternatives from other different decisions. There have been several research efforts aiming at providing sufficient mechanisms and tools for facilitating the architectural evaluation and design process. These approaches, however, address architectural decisions in isolation, where they focus on evaluating a limited set of alternatives belonging to one architectural decision. This has been the primary motivation behind the development of the Architectural DEcision-Making Support (ADEMS) framework, which basically aims at supporting stakeholders and architects during the architectural decision-making process by helping them determining a suitable combination of architectural alternatives. ADEMS framework is an iterative process that leverages rigorous quantitative decision-making techniques available in the literature of Management Science, particularly Multiple Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) methods and Integer Programming (IP). Furthermore, due to the number of architectural decisions involved as well as the variety of available alternatives, the architecture design space is expected to be huge. For this purpose, a query language has been developed, known as the Architecture Query Language (AQL), to aid architects in exploring and analyzing the design space in further depth, and also in examining different ???what-if??? architectural scenarios. In addition, in order to support leveraging ADEMS framework, a support tool has been implemented for carrying out the sophisticated set of mathematical computations and comparisons of the large number of architectural combinations, which might otherwise be hard to conduct using manual techniques. The primary contribution of the tool is in its help to identify, evaluate, and rank all potential combinations of alternatives based on their satisfaction to quality preferences provided by the different stakeholders. Finally, to assess the feasibility of ADEMS, three different case studies have been conducted relating to the architectural evaluation of different e-business and enterprise applications. Results obtained for the three case studies were quite positive as they showed an acceptable accuracy level for the decisions recommended by ADEMS, and at a reasonable time and effort costs for the different system stakeholders.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">software architecture evaluation and design</field><field name="subject">design of e-business applications</field><field name="subject">optimization-based evaluation</field><field name="subject">quality-driven design</field><field name="subject">electronic commerce</field><field name="subject">decision support systems</field><field name="subject">computer architecture.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23419</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis of amines and imines organometallic catalysts</field><field name="creator">Rumble, Sarah Louise, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes investigations into the catalysed syntheses of amines and imines using organoiridium and organorhodium complexes with N-donor ligands as the catalysts. These catalysed syntheses were achieved via hydroamination, hydrosilylation, and hydrogenation reactions, as well as tandem hydroamination/imine reduction reactions. An in situ catalysis study found that the most active catalysts for the hydroamination of 4-pentyn-1-amine (1) to give 2-methyl-1-pyrroline (4) were formed from a combination of catalyst components that resulted in an electron deficient metal centre, indicating that an alkyne binding mechanism was most likely. The kinetics of the hydroamination of 4-pentyn-1-amine (1), catalysed by the complexes [Rh(bim)(CO)2][BPh4] (7), [Ir(bim)(CO)2][BPh4] (8), [Rh(bpm)(CO)2][BPh4] (9),and [Ir(bpm)(CO)2][BPh4] (10) (bpm = bis(1-pyrazolyl)methane and bim = bis(Nmethylimidazol- 2-yl)methane) were modelled and compared. The nature of the metal centre was found to have the most influence on the rate of the product release step, while the nature of the N-donor ligand was found to have the most influence on the rate of the substrate binding step. The investigation of the catalysed hydroamination of the phenyl substituted alkynylamines 5-phenyl-4-pentyn-1-amine (2), 4-phenyl-3-butyn-1-amine (13) and 2- phenyl-4-pentyn-1-amine (34) revealed a difference in catalytic activity between the rhodium and iridium complexes depending on the alkyne substituent. A series of novel rhodium(I) complexes were synthesised: [RhClCO(Mes-DAD(Me))] (38), [RhClCO(Mes-BIAN)] (22), [Rh(COD)(Mes-BIAN)][BF4] (39), [Rh2(COD)2(bmimen)](BPh4)2 (40) and [Rh2(CO)4(bmimen)](BPh4)2 (41), where Mes- DAD(Me) = biacetylbis(2,4,6-trimethylphenylimine), Mes-BIAN = bis(2,4,6- trimethylphenylimino)acenapthene and bmimen = 1,2-bis[(1-methyl-2- imidazolyl)methylene-amino]ethane. The cationic complex 40 was found to be an active hydroamination catalyst, while the neutral complexes 38 and 22 were only active in the presence of the tetraphenylborate counterion. A range of imines was found to be efficiently reduced to their respective amines via hydrosilylation or hydrogenation using the iridium(I) complex [Ir(bpm)(CO)2][BPh4] (10) as catalyst. The hydrosilylation reaction was found to be significantly faster in a protic solvent (methanol), giving the desilylated amines without the need for a desilylation step. The mechanism of this reaction was proposed to involve a monohydride iridium(I) complex as a key intermediate. The tandem hydroamination/hydrosilylation of a series of alkynylamine substrates was achieved using the iridium complexes 8 and 10, in which the iridium complex catalyses the two mechanistically distinct reactions in the one-pot. Catalysed tandem hydroamination/hydrogenation reactions were also achieved, but were less facile.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">amines</field><field name="subject">organometallic catalysts</field><field name="subject">imines.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene studies in epidermolysis bullosa</field><field name="creator">Kemp, Matthew W, St. George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of inherited blistering diseases that share the common feature of blister formation subsequent to normal mechanical insult of the epidermis. Despite two decades of investigation at both epidemiological and genetic levels, there remains much yet to be uncovered about the pathophysiology of this disease. This research had dual aims. Firstly, by enrolling patients in Australia and New Zealand with the simplex type of EB (EBS) in a screening programme in conjunction with a highly detailed review of the EB and intermediate filament literatures, we hoped to gain a better understanding of the correlation between genotype and phenotype in EBS. Secondly, we attempted to evaluate the use of baculoviral vectors as a means of introducing the type VII collagen cDNA into human dermal fibroblasts and primary human epidermal keratinocytes. Among the EBS patients screened we identified a novel multi residue deletion in keratin 5 which led to a surprisingly mild form of epidermolysis bullosa Dowling ??? Meara. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of epidermal tissue from the affected individual showed that the mutant transcript was present at levels 2.7 fold higher than the wild type transcript. We demonstrated a family in which the presence of a previously reported keratin 14 mutation A413T appeared to induce disease expression in only one of the three individuals found to carry the mutations. We also identified two EBS families with no mutations in either keratin 5 or keratin 14. This is the first study to analyse EB patients from New Zealand and the first to report the presence of a deletion mutation in the 2B domain of keratin 5. The results of our type VII collagen transfer work showed that baculoviruses can be engineered to contain insert sequences in excess of 10kb and are able to gain entry to both human dermal fibroblasts and primary human epidermal keratinocytes. Electron microscopy and analyses of the baculoviral vectors showed that the lack of protein expression subsequent to infection of human dermal fibroblasts and primary human epidermal keratinocytes is likely due to the inability of the vector to escape cytoplasmic endosomes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">epidermolysis bullosa</field><field name="subject">genetics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deterrence, punishment severity and drink-driving</field><field name="creator">Briscoe, Suzanne Marie, Social Science &amp; Policy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis tests one of the major propositions of deterrence theory: that increases in the severity of punishment can reduce the likelihood of offending. To this end, a case study in which the statutory penalties were doubled for almost all drink-driving offences in New South Wales, Australia, is examined. Two quasi-experimental studies were undertaken to assess the impact of these legislative changes: an interrupted time-series analysis of road crash rates (Study 1) and an analysis of drink-driving reoffending rates before and after the penalty changes were implemented (Study 2). Study 1 showed a significant increase in a surrogate measure of alcohol-related road crashes after the tougher drink-driving penalties were introduced. Further analyses suggested that this increase was driven primarily by a secular rise in non alcohol-related crashes that coincided with the policy???s implementation. Two possible conclusions about the deterrent effect of the policy are drawn from these findings: (1) that there was a reduction in alcohol-related road crashes which was overwhelmed by the rise in non alcohol-related crashes occurring around the same time or (2) that there was no change in crash rates. Study 2 found that drink-drivers who were convicted under the new penalty regime were less likely, and took longer, to reoffend than drink-drivers convicted before the introduction of the new penalties. This reduction in reoffending was only apparent for drink-drivers residing in country and regional areas and was small in magnitude.These latter findings are consistent with the possibility that the penalty changes coincided with a reduction in alcohol-related crashes but suggest that any decrease is likely to have been relatively small. A third study using a scenario-based survey methodology was also undertaken to examine the relationship between legal sanctions and willingness to drink-drive, controlling for other factors. The results of this study showed that participants who were more knowledgeable about drink-driving penalties were less likely to state that they would offend in the drink-driving scenario than participants who were less knowledgeable about the law. The implications of these findings for deterrence theory and criminal justice policy are discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drinking and traffic accidents</field><field name="subject">drink driving</field><field name="subject">deterrence</field><field name="subject">sentencing</field><field name="subject">criminal justice interventions</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deterministic model of microbial sources, fate and transport: a quantitative tool for pathogen catchment budgeting</field><field name="creator">Ferguson, Christobel Margaret, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The most important priority for the management of Australian drinking water catchments is the control of pathogen loads delivered to raw water reservoirs and treatment plant intakes.  A process-based mathematical model was developed to estimate pathogen catchment budgets (PCB) for Cryptosporidium, Giardia and E. coli loads generated within and exported from catchments.  The model quantified key processes affecting the generation and transport of microorganisms from humans and animal excreta using land use and hydrologic data, and catchment specific information including point sources such as sewage treatment plants and on-site systems.  The PCB model was applied in the Wingecarribee catchment, Sydney and used to predict and rank pathogen and indicator loads in dry weather, intermediate (&lt;30 mm in 24 h) and large wet weather events (100mm in 24 h).  Sensitivity analysis identified that pathogen excretion rates from animals and humans, and manure mobilisation rates were the most significant factors determining the output of the model.  Comparison with water quality data indicated that predicted dry weather loads were generally within 1-2 log10 of the measured loads for Cryptosporidium and E. coli and within 1 log10 for Giardia.  The model was subsequently used to predict and rank pathogen and indicator loads for the entire (16 000 km2) Sydney drinking water catchment.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pathogen</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="subject">Cryptosporidium</field><field name="subject">catchment</field><field name="subject">watershed</field><field name="subject">pathogenic microorganisms</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="subject">drinking water</field><field name="subject">contamination</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Composite web services provisioning in dynamic environments</field><field name="creator">Sheng, Quanzheng, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Web services composition is emerging as a promising technology for the effective automation of application-to-application collaborations. The application integration problems have been subject of much research in the past years. However, with growth in importance of business process automation and highly dynamic nature of the Internet, this research has taken on a new significance and importance. Adequate solutions to this problem will be very important to make enterprise systems more flexible, robust and usable in the future. In this dissertation, we present a novel approach for the declarative definition and scalable orchestration of composite Web services in large, autonomous, heterogeneous, and dynamic environments. We first propose a composition model for composing Web services in a personalized and adaptive manner. We model composite Web services based on statecharts. To cater for large amounts of dynamic Web services, we use the concept of service community that groups services together and is responsible for the runtime selection of services against user's preferences. We use the concept of process schema that specific users can adjust with their personal preferences. A set of exception handling policies can be specified to proactively react to runtime exceptions. We then propose a tuple space based service orchestration model for distributed, self-managed composite services execution. We introduce the concept of execution controller that is associated with a service and is responsible for monitoring and controlling service executions. The knowledge required by a controller is statically extracted from the specification of personalized composite services. We also present techniques for robust Web services provisioning. The techniques presented in this dissertation are implemented in Self-Serv, a prototype that provides a set of tools for Web service composition and execution. Finally, we conduct an extensive usability and performance study of the proposed techniques. The experimental results reveal that our system i) provides an efficient support for specifying, deploying, and accessing composite services; ii) is more scalable and outperforms the centralized approach when the exchanged messages become bigger; and iii) is more robust and adaptive in highly dynamic environments.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">web service</field><field name="subject">service composition</field><field name="subject">service-oriented architecture</field><field name="subject">personalization</field><field name="subject">exception handling</field><field name="subject">control tuple</field><field name="subject">self-managed orchestration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23457</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the neural correlates of higher cognitive functions in humans using transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation</field><field name="creator">Feredoes, Eva, Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">An important aspect of cognitive neuroscience is to localise specific brain regions involved in cognitive tasks, and to determine the mediating brain processes. There are several investigative approaches towards this, but amongst them, only transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is able to interfere with the brain in such a way as to show the critical involvement of a brain region in a particular behaviour.  TMS can be applied in normal subjects during the performance of a cognitive task and the resulting disruption of activity in the targeted brain region leads to an alteration in, or suspension of, behaviour consequent upon that brain activity. More recently, another brain stimulation technique has emerged that may also be able to contribute to the investigation of human cognition. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applies a weak direct current to a targeted brain region, modulating cortical excitability and thereby altering the behavioural output. tDCS may be able to provide information that complements TMS and other investigative techniques by modulating behaviour in a way that depends on the role the brain region is carrying out in the task. This thesis describes a series of experiments in which TMS and tDCS were applied to two well-studied cognitive behaviours, working memory (WM) and mental rotation (MR). WM is the temporary retention of information that can be manipulated in order to guide behaviour. The most popular psychological model of WM proposes a multi-modal central executive (CE) that acts upon information stored in dedicated buffers (Baddeley, 1986). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is a strong candidate as a key CE node (D'Esposito &amp; Postle, 2000; Petrides, 2000b; Smith &amp; Jonides, 1997; Stuss &amp; Knight, 2002).  MR is a visuo-cognitive process by which an image can be mentally modified into an orientation other than the one in which it is displayed (Corballis &amp; McLaren, 1984). The area centred around the intraparietal sulcus is a brain key region for MR (Alivisatos &amp; Petrides, 1996; Harris et al., 2000; Jordan et al., 2001).  The work presented in this thesis examines the roles of the DLPFC and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in WM and MR, respectively, and also highlights some of the methodological issues that are necessary to consider in order to produce reliable virtual lesions. The studies were carried out in young healthy volunteers, and were approved by the institutional ethics committee. In one study, repetitive TMS (rTMS) was shown to disrupt the manipulation of verbal information held in WM when administered over the right DLPFC, a result which supports a process-based segregation of the human prefrontal cortex for WM. Low- and high-frequency rTMS did not disrupt performance on another popular test of executive processing, n-back, a result which suggests that specific stimulation and task conditions must be met in order to produce virtual lesions, but also questions the critical importance of recruitment of the DLPFC for a running span task.  rTMS applied to the right PPC replicated results from a previous TMS investigation, supporting the critical role this region in the rotation of images (Harris &amp; Miniussi, 2003). When the left PPC was stimulated, impairment was produced only for the rotation of inverted stimuli. A role for the left PPC in the rotation of objects-as-a-whole is proposed based on these findings.  The use of tDCS in the investigation of WM and MR is amongst the first to be described. Stimulation of the left DLPFC led to decreased performance accuracy on a verbal WM task in a polarity-specific manner. The pattern of results produced supports the role of the DLPFC as a node of a CE. tDCS over the left DLPFC did not modulate n-back task performance, a result which supports the TMS results that the involvement of the left DLPFC is not critical to the successful performance of the n-back task, although methodological issues remain of concern in relation to this conclusion. MR was not affected by tDCS applied to the right PPC and this result is most likely a direct demonstration of the importance of electrode montage. In conclusion, these studies show that rTMS and tDCS can be usefully applied to create virtual cortical lesions or modulate cortical excitability during the performance of cognitive tasks in humans, and can play an important role in investigating cognitive neuropsychological models. More widespread use of these techniques to complement lesion studies and functional neuroimaging is recommended.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">working memory</field><field name="subject">mental rotation</field><field name="subject">transcranial magnetic stimulation</field><field name="subject">transcranial direct current stimulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23460</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Limit and shakedown analyses by the p-version fem</field><field name="creator">Ngo, Ngoc Son, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a contribution towards a general procedure for solving robustly and efficiently limit and shakedown analyses of engineering structures within the static approach which has been chosen for its simplicity of implementation. Throughout the thesis, attempts at improving the robustness and efficiency of the computations are presented. Beginning with efforts to prevent volumetric locking, which is a severe shortcoming of traditional low order h-type displacement elements, the investigation proposes the use of the high order p-version of the finite element method. It is shown theoretically and confirmed numerically that this p-method is not only robust in preventing locking, but also provides very accurate results. However, the use of uniformly distributed high order p-elements may be computationally demanding when the size of the problem becomes large. This difficulty is tackled by two main approaches: use of a p-adaptive procedure at the elastic computation stage and use of approximate piecewise linear yield functions. The p-adaptive scheme produces a non-uniform p-distribution and helps to greatly reduce the number of degrees of freedom needed while still guaranteeing the required level of accuracy. The overall gain is that the sizes of the models are reduced significantly and hence also the computational effort.  The adoption of piecewise linear yield surfaces helps to further increase the efficiency at the expense of possibly slightly less accurate, but still very acceptable, results. State-of-the-art linear programming solvers based on the very efficient interior point methodology are used. Significant gains in efficiency are achieved. A heuristic, semi-adaptive scheme to piecewise linearize the yield surfaces is then developed to further reduce the size of the underlying optimization problems.

Through an analysis of contemporary women???s advice literature and the fiction of two authors I locate the discourse within the larger ideologies of femininity (which defined women as different from men based on their gender) and domesticity (which assigned women to the domestic sphere because of gender) and analyse its fundamental features. The mother was a representation of the ideal woman and thus the measure for standards of behaviour within the discourse of moral education, and, indeed, within the ideologies of femininity and domesticity for all women. I focus on the inconsistencies that the discourse of moral education attempts to mask in its representations of women. Part I (Chapters One, Two and Three) examines the social standards of behaviour for mothers established in women???s advice literature and the literature???s simultaneous resistance to these standards. Chapters Four and Five are dedicated to Anne Bront?????s two novels, Agnes Grey and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall; in particular, Chapter Five examines how Helen Huntingdon???s attempts to be the perfect moral mother are constantly open to conflicting ideological interpretation exposing ambivalence within the discourse of moral education and in the novel???s approach to the discourse. Chapters Six, Seven and Eight focus on many of Gaskell???s short stories as well as her novel Ruth. The inherent conflict within the discourse of moral education results in three separate images of motherhood for Gaskell???s fiction: traditional mothers who gain their moral influence through an association with death, the ideologically contradictory moral mother, and women who use maternal traits to live in communities of women without men. I conclude that none of the texts are categorically resistant to or complicit with the ideals within the discourse of moral education but are internally contradictory. In particular, the fiction simultaneously promotes conventional ideals of womanhood and moral mothers as self-sacrificing and nurturing and offers a vision of women either in unhappy compliance with or otherwise defying these ideals, for example, by living in unconventional relationships without men.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23469</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate disclosure by listed companies in the People???s Republic of China and Australia: seeking an appropriate pathway for the regulation of the Chinese securities market</field><field name="creator">Fu, Jian, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">With the rapid growth in the development of economic reform in the People???s Republic of China since the late 1970s, China???s legal system has also been undergoing major reform and development. This has seen the emergence of a major effort to draw upon the law reform experiences of other countries, especially in the area of economic law reform. As the securities industry is a key component of an increasingly corporatised market economy, it has been necessary to adopt an effective body of securities laws. Disclosure is the fundamental issue of securities laws as it exists in market transactions and the conduct of market participants. As such, the development of an appropriate body of disclosure law and practice is vital to the integrity of securities law and ultimately to the market economy. It is for this reason that this dissertation looks at the development of China???s securities market and corporate disclosure laws, and identifies the forces that have led to its current form and content. This dissertation argues that China???s legal system must be seen as a product of China???s distinctive history and local circumstances. It analyses the current nature of China???s corporate disclosure laws and notes that China???s law reformers have relied heavily upon the US model which may not necessarily suit China. Based upon a number of theoretical understandings of the transplantation and development of law, this dissertation argues that China???s approach to law reform in this area has not always produced a body of law that is appropriate to China???s particular circumstances. It suggests that valuable insights can be gained from a comparison of the methods of corporate disclosure law reform that were followed in Australia. The Australian experience is relevant to China as Australian lawyers and regulators have played an important role in fashioning securities regulation in Hong Kong and as Hong Kong has sometimes been seen as providing useful models for China itself.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23478</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In the trenches: a comparative analysis of the nature and effectiveness of the mobilisation of law by domestic human rights NGOs in the United States, Britain and Germany.</field><field name="creator">Calnan, Scott, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis critically compares how domestic human rights NGOs (DNGOs) in the United States, Britain and Germany use (or mobilise) law to enforce human rights standards and proposes a method to measure their effectiveness in doing so. To do this it draws upon both case studies and literature from many disciplines. On the basis of the data and the literature it finds that, despite their great diversity, DNGOs in each jurisdiction show general similarities in their ???styles??? of operation and use of the law. It also finds that their effectiveness in enforcing human rights can be ascertained with reasonable accuracy and that a DNGO???s size and access to resources does not necessarily correlate with its effectiveness. The context in which the above questions were investigated was one in which there existed very little literature that examined the work of DNGOs (as opposed to international NGOs) as well as few theoretical approaches that would allow their activities to be critically examined and compared. It was also a context in which there was a great deal of discussion in the literature about the crucial importance of DNGOs in human rights enforcement and a growing suspicion that Globalisation might be making their role even more important than it was in the past. To address these issues the author used case studies to supply the necessary detail and a method using ???ideal types??? to assess the data. He also proposed a method to measure DNGO effectiveness so that the case studies could be more thoroughly compared and their true success in human rights enforcement revealed. Despite the incredible diversity among DNGOs the author was able to draw a few useful conclusions about how successful DNGOs operate. In response to these conclusions the author proposed that one possible route by which DNGOs could improve their effectiveness was to transplant their characteristics between jurisdictions. The author also found some evidence that Globalisation was having an effect on DNGOs and proposed some ways in which individual case studies could take advantage of this.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human rights advocacy - Cross-cultural studies</field><field name="subject">Human rights workers - United States - Great Britain - Germany</field><field name="subject">Civil rights - Societies, etc. - United States - Great Britain - Germany.</field><field name="subject">Non-governmental organizations - United States - Great Britain - Germany.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monetary policy in Japan's 'Great Recession:' neo-Wicksellian and monetarist approaches</field><field name="creator">Kirchner, Stephen Ian Leslie, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the problems posed by Japan???s recent macroeconomic experience for conventional monetary policy theory and practice.  Japan???s experience with deflation and the zero lower bound for nominal official interest rates is placed in the context of neo-Wicksellian and monetarist interpretations of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.  The neo-Wicksellian approach to the zero bound problem is shown to suffer significant limitations in view of Japan???s experience, while a monetarist interpretation of the transmission mechanism is shown to be more robust.  The thesis considers the role of the official interest rate and the money base in vector autoregression  models of the Japanese economy, finding that the economy became less amenable to effective stabilisation by monetary policy from the early 1990s onwards.  A new approach to estimating a neo-Wicksellian monetary policy rule for the Bank of Japan is proposed and the robustness of the parameters of this rule determined.  The thesis motivates a role for the money base in the determination of real output and inflation.  A policy rule in the growth rate of the nominal money base is estimated and the stability of its parameters with respect to a hypothesised structural break and changes in the governorship of the Bank of Japan is considered.  Aggregate demand and supply specifications for the Japanese economy are estimated that show a distinct role for the money base that is independent of the official interest rate.  These specifications are extended to develop a model of the Japanese economy.  The model is distinctive in incorporating both neo-Wicksellian and monetarist views of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.  The macroeconomic stabilisation properties of various interest rate and money base growth rules are compared in the context of the model, using stochastic simulation methods.  In particular, a policy rule in the growth rate of the nominal money base with the nominal official interest rate set to zero is simulated and shown to have macroeconomic stabilisation properties that compare favourably to conventional interest rate rules.  The thesis concludes that the neglect of money in contemporary monetary policy theory and practice is mistaken in view of Japan???s recent macroeconomic experience.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">economy</field><field name="subject">monetary policy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24169</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk factors for repetitive microtrauma injury to adolescent and adult cricket fast bowlers</field><field name="creator">Dennis, Rebecca Jane, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cricket is one of Australia's most popular sports, both in terms of participation rates and spectator interest. However, as with all sports, participation in cricket can be associated with a risk of injury. Injury surveillance in Australia and internationally has consistently identified fast bowlers as the players at the greatest risk of injury. This clearly establishes fast bowlers as the priority group for continued risk factor research. The primary aim of this thesis is to describe the epidemiology of repetitive microtrauma injuries and identify the risk factors for these injuries to male adolescent and adult fast bowlers. The program of research consists of three sequential prospective cohort studies, which were conducted over four cricket seasons. The rate of injury was high in all these studies, with nearly half of the 305 bowlers sustaining an injury. The first of the three studies, which was conducted over three seasons, recruited 95 adult first-class fast bowlers and investigated bowling workload as a risk factor for injury. The findings suggested that there were thresholds for both low and high workload, beyond which the risk of injury increased. The second study recruited 47 adolescent high performance fast bowlers for one season, and identified a significant association between high bowling workload and injury. Based on the results of these two studies, workload guidelines for adult and adolescent fast bowlers are described in detail in this thesis. The third study expanded on the first two workload studies and concurrently investigated a range of potential injury risk factors relating to bowling workload,  physical characteristics and bowling technique. A total of 91 adult and adolescent high performance fast bowlers participated in the third study for one season. Two independent predictors of injury were identified: increased hip internal rotation and reduced ankle dorsiflexion. This program of research has provided information that is essential for the development of evidence-based injury prevention guidelines for adolescent and adult fast bowlers. The next stage in the injury prevention process is to implement measures that control the exposure to the injury risk factors identified in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cricket injuries</field><field name="subject">cricket</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24172</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The identification of novel biomarkers in the development and progression of early prostate cancer</field><field name="creator">Rasiah, Krishan Kumar, St Vincent's, UNSW</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT The morphological premalignant changes in prostate epithelium such as high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) precede invasive prostate cancer (PC) by several decades. The overall aim of this project was to identify patterns of gene expression in HGPIN and early PC which increase our understanding of the early biology of PC and identify genes and pathways that correlate with an aggressive phenotype. A comprehensive tissue cohort of premalignant prostate lesions was collected in a tissue microarray (TMA) platform that was utilised for high-throughput validation of target genes. Using this unique resource, the expression of the tumour suppressor gene PTEN was assessed using immunohistochemistry in an initial candidate gene approach based on mouse models implicating PTEN in carcinogenesis. No significant difference in expression of PTEN was detected in premalignant and benign epithelium. A transcript profiling approach was undertaken by integrating laser capture microdissection, linear RNA amplification and oligonucleotide microarrays to perform a screen of matched patient samples of normal, HGPIN and PC cells. The expression patterns of two genes encoding secreted proteins, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and macrophage inhibitory cytokine (MIC-1) were validated using immunohistochemistry on TMAs representing the progression model of early PC. Increased expression of these proteins in PC was confirmed to occur early in the disease process and altered expression of NPY and MIC-1 was associated with worse clinical outcome. Further analysis of global gene expression patterns using a structured network knowledge base identified a notable aberration in the expression of extracellular matrix and extracellular matrix associated proteins in HGPIN and provided novel evidence for the role of this class of molecules in the development of PC. In summary, contrary to current dogma based on work in animal models, altered PTEN expression is unlikely to represent an important event in the development of malignancy in the human prostate. In contrast, the expression patterns and prognostic value of NPY and MIC-1 in HGPIN support their further evaluation as biomarkers for the development and progression of PC. The aberrant expression of genes and networks of genes detected in HGPIN will assist in further identification of biological pathways which may be targeted in therapeutic strategies against the development and progression of PC.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">prostate cancer</field><field name="subject">high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia</field><field name="subject">laser capture microdissection</field><field name="subject">tissue microarray</field><field name="subject">oligonucleotide microarray</field><field name="subject">prognostic markers</field><field name="subject">biomarkers</field><field name="subject">neuropeptide Y</field><field name="subject">macrophage inhibitory cytokine - 1</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24187</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scalable video compression with optimized visual performance and random accessibility</field><field name="creator">Leung, Raymond, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with maximizing the coding efficiency, random accessibility and visual performance of scalable compressed video. The unifying theme behind this work is the use of finely embedded localized coding structures, which govern the extent to which these goals may be jointly achieved. The first part focuses on scalable volumetric image compression. We investigate 3D transform and coding techniques which exploit inter-slice statistical redundancies without compromising slice accessibility. Our study shows that the motion-compensated temporal discrete wavelet transform (MC-TDWT) practically achieves an upper bound to the compression efficiency of slice transforms. From a video coding perspective, we find that most of the coding gain is attributed to offsetting the learning penalty in adaptive arithmetic coding through 3D code-block extension, rather than inter-frame context modelling.  The second aspect of this thesis examines random accessibility. Accessibility refers to the ease with which a region of interest is accessed (subband samples needed for reconstruction are retrieved) from a compressed video bitstream, subject to spatiotemporal code-block constraints. We investigate the fundamental implications of motion compensation for random access efficiency and the compression performance of scalable interactive video. We demonstrate that inclusion of motion compensation operators within the lifting steps of a temporal subband transform incurs a random access penalty which depends on the characteristics of the motion field.  The final aspect of this thesis aims to minimize the perceptual impact of visible distortion in scalable reconstructed video. We present a visual optimization strategy based on distortion scaling which raises the distortion-length slope of perceptually significant samples. This alters the codestream embedding order during post-compression rate-distortion optimization, thus allowing visually sensitive sites to be encoded with higher fidelity at a given bit-rate.  For visual sensitivity analysis, we propose a contrast perception model that incorporates an adaptive masking slope. This versatile feature provides a context which models perceptual significance. It enables scene structures that otherwise suffer significant degradation to be preserved at lower bit-rates. The novelty in our approach derives from a set of "perceptual mappings" which account for quantization noise shaping effects induced by motion-compensated temporal synthesis. The proposed technique reduces wavelet compression artefacts and improves the perceptual quality of video.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">scalable video compression</field><field name="subject">visual optimization</field><field name="subject">perceptual quality</field><field name="subject">perceived distortion</field><field name="subject">wavelet artefacts</field><field name="subject">temporal subband synthesis</field><field name="subject">perceptual mapping</field><field name="subject">localized embedded coding structures</field><field name="subject">EBCOT</field><field name="subject">post-compression rate-distortion optimization (PCRD-opt)</field><field name="subject">3-D context modelling</field><field name="subject">coding gain</field><field name="subject">region of interest</field><field name="subject">random access efficiency</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24192</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of hybridisation of DNA immobilised on gold: strategies for DNA biosensing</field><field name="creator">Mearns, Freya Justine, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis outlines a study of the physical changes that hybridisation imposes on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) immobilised by one end to a substrate, and of how such physical changes can be exploited to detect specific sequences of DNA in a target solution. The system studied was composed of a mixed monolayer of 20mer ssDNA with C6 alkanethiolate modifications on their 3??? ends and short-chain hydroxyterminated alkanethiolates, on a gold substrate. It was prepared using the self-assembly properties of alkanethiols on gold.  Atomic force microscopy images showed that the end-immobilised ssDNA is flexible enough to lie over the diluent hydroxy-terminated self-assembled monolayer (SAM). Hybridisation was shown to cause the DNA to become more rigid and stand up off the substrate due to an increase in persistence length. Such physical changes of the DNA upon hybridisation were significant enough to be exploited in the development of a DNA recognition interface.  The recognition interface was designed with the view of keeping it both simple to make and simple to use, and was coupled with electrochemical transduction. A label-free recognition interface was developed that relied on the oxidation of the sulfur head group of the alkanethiolate SAM to detect hybridisation (firstly air oxidation and then electrochemical oxidation). It produced a positive signal upon hybridisation with complementary target DNA.  Improvements in the reliability and robustness of the recognition interface were made using a labelled approach. The labelled version employed electroactive molecules as labels on the 5??? ends of the probe DNA strands. Two labels were investigated ??? anthraquinone and ferrocene. The flexibility of the ssDNA ensured that the redox labels were able to directly access the underlying gold electrode. Hybridisation was expected to remove the labels from the electrode due to an increase in the DNA???s persistence length, and thus perturb the electrochemical signal. The use of ferrocene as a label provided a ???proof-of-concept??? for the system. The labelled recognition interface provides a foundation for the future development of a simple, reliable, and selective DNA hybridisation biosensor.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="subject">hybridisation</field><field name="subject">biosensor</field><field name="subject">electrodes</field><field name="subject">electrochemistry</field><field name="subject">SAMs</field><field name="subject">self assembly</field><field name="subject">monolayers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23978</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A force for Federation: international exhibitions and the formation of Australian ethos (1851-1901)</field><field name="creator">Orr, Kirsten, School of Architecture, UNSW</field><field name="description">In 1879 the British Colony of New South Wales hosted the first international exhibition in the Southern Hemisphere.  This was immediately followed by the Melbourne International Exhibition of 1880 in the colony of Victoria and the success of these exhibitions inspired the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition, which was held in 1888 to celebrate the centenary of white settlement in Australia.  My thesis is that these international exhibitions had a profound impact on the development of our cities, the evolution of an Australian ethos and the gaining of nationhood.  The immense popularity and comprehensive nature of the exhibitions made them the only major events in late nineteenth-century Australia that brought the people together in an almost universally shared experience.  The exhibitions conveyed official ideologies from the organising elites to ordinary people and encouraged the dissemination of new cultural sentiments, political aspirations, and moral and educational ideals.  Many exhibition commissioners, official observers and ideologues were also predominantly involved in the Federation movement and the wider cultural sphere.  The international exhibitions assisted the development of an Australian urban ethos, which to a large extent replaced the older pastoral / frontier image.  Many of the more enduring ideas emanating from the exhibitions were physically expressed in the consequent development of our cities ??? particularly Sydney and Melbourne, both of which had achieved metropolitan status and global significance by the end of the nineteenth century.  The new urban ethos, dramatically triggered by Sydney 1879, combined with and strengthened the national aspirations and sentiments of the Federation movement.  Thus the exhibitions created an immediate connection between colonial pride in urban development and European and American ideals of nation building.  They also created an increasing cultural sophistication and a growing involvement in social movements and political associations at the national level.  The international exhibitions, more than any other single event, convinced the colonials that they were all Australians together and that their destiny was to be united as one nation.  At that time, Australians began to think about national objectives.  The exhibitions not only promulgated national sentiment and a new ethos, but also provided opportunities for independent colonial initiatives, inter-colonial cooperation and a more equal position in the imperial alliance.  Thus they became a powerful impetus, hitherto unrecognised, for the complex of social, political and economic developments that made Federation possible.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">National characteristics Australia</field><field name="subject">Australia politics &amp; government 1851-1901</field><field name="subject">city planning Australia history</field><field name="subject">Architecture Australia 19th century</field><field name="subject">Sydney International Exhibition (1879: Sydney</field><field name="subject">NSW)</field><field name="subject">Melbourne International Exhibition (1880-81: Melbourne</field><field name="subject">Vic)</field><field name="subject">Melbourne Centennial International Exhibition (1888-89: Melbourne</field><field name="subject">Vic)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23987</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isotope shift and relativistic shift in atomic spectra</field><field name="creator">Berengut, Julian Carlo, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">At present several groups are analysing quasar absorption spectra to search for variation of the fine structure constant, alpha, across space and time. These studies compare the wavelengths of several transitions observed in the absorption clouds with those seen in the laboratory, and interpret anomalies as variation in alpha. One group has already presented evidence that alpha may have been smaller at an early epoch. Other groups using different telescopes see no variation. These studies use the ???many-multiplet??? method, which relies on the utilisation of many transitions in many ions to enhance the size of the effects and remove sources of systematic error. While this method offers an order-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity over the previously used alkali-doublet method, the alpha-dependence (relativistic shift) of every transition used in the analysis must be calculated ab initio. In this thesis we present a method for the precise calculation of relativistic shifts, based on an energy calculation involving combination of the configuration interaction method and many-body perturbation theory. The many-multiplet method also introduces a potential systematic error: if the relative isotope abundances of the absorbers differ from terrestrial abundances then there can be spurious shifts in the measured wavelengths, which may be incorrectly interpreted as variation of alpha. A ???conspiracy??? of several isotopic abundances may provide an alternative explanation for the observed spectral anomalies. To account for these systematic errors we need accurate values of the isotope shift. We calculate these shifts using the finite-field method to reduce the problem to that of an energy calculation, which in turn is done using the same method used for the relativistic shift. We present the results of our calculations for a variety of atoms and ions seen in quasar absorption spectra. The results of this research should allow astrophysicists to measure isotope abundances in the absorbers directly. This can provide a test for models of nuclear reactions in stars and supernovae, and of the chemical evolution of the Universe. Our calculations can also be used in conjunction with measurements to extract changes in nuclear charge radii between isotopes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alpha variation</field><field name="subject">isotope shift</field><field name="subject">relativistic shift</field><field name="subject">spectrum analysis</field><field name="subject">isotopes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Little terrors:the child???s threat to social order in the Victorian bildungsroman</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Timothy Paul, English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of rebellious child protagonists in Victorian bildungsroman.  It discusses five novels ??? Jane Eyre, The Mill on the Floss, What Maisie Knew, Vanity Fair and Kim ??? that feature ???radical child??? protagonists who use indirect methods of narrative control to resist conservative models of character development.   It argues that these novels form a subset of subversive English bildungsromane, which threaten the genre???s traditionally liberal values. Theories of narrative desire, reader seduction and discursive manipulation are used to reveal how the radical child in the Victorian bildungsroman takes command of the reader???s sympathy and gains power over the realist text, despite its physical and social powerlessness.  Especially important is the presence of a fantasy counterplot, which coexists with, and ultimately undermines, the bildungsroman???s realistic surface narrative of successful socialisation.  The counterplot allows radical child protagonists to develop in a non-linear manner that contradicts bourgeois ideals of stable progress.  Focusing instead on sites of rupture between the individual and society, subversive bildungsromane resist both the dialectical model of character, which aims to harmoniously unite the protagonist with the realist world, and the dialogic model of interaction, which requires the restriction of personal liberty for the common good.  This rebellious child in the Victorian bildungsroman thus represents an assault on the genre???s democratic ideals.  Rejecting compromise, the radical child replaces the bildungsroman???s central ethic of interpersonal responsibility with an individualistic ethic of domination.  Indeed, the thesis argues that the appeal of such child protagonistslies in their rejection of the obligatory, but anticlimactic, exchange of freedom for security that underpins the realist bildungsroman???s social contract, a rejection attractive to the reader precisely because it is unrealisable in reality. Finally, the thesis compares this radical child with the Gothic monster.  While the monster is punished for its subversion, the radical child???s counterplot enables it to enact most of its subversive desires unpunished.  The conservative English bildungsroman thus becomes a more effective way of representing asocial energies than the more obviously radical Gothic genre, which openly displays its anti-democratic sentiments.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children in Literature; English Fiction - 19th Century - History and criticism; Bront??</field><field name="subject">Charlotte</field><field name="subject">1816-1855 -- Criticism and interpretation; Eliot</field><field name="subject">George</field><field name="subject">1819-1880 -- Criticism and interpretation; James</field><field name="subject">Henry</field><field name="subject">1843-1916 -- Criticism and interpretation; Thackeray</field><field name="subject">William Makepeace</field><field name="subject">1811-1863 -- Criticism and interpretation; Kipling</field><field name="subject">Rudyard</field><field name="subject">1865-1936 -- Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of mood and judgmental heuristics on decision making under uncertainty</field><field name="creator">Chan, Yu Man Norman, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Five experiments investigated the effects of mood and judgmental heuristics on decision making under uncertainty. According to the mood-and-general-knowledge model (Bless, 2000), the assimilation-accommodation model (Fiedler, 2000) and the numeric-priming account of anchoring (Jacowitz &amp; Kahneman, 1995; Wong &amp; Kwong, 2000), happy individuals should rely more on the anchoring heuristic in decision making under uncertainty. However, the semantic-priming account of anchoring (Strack &amp; Mussweiler, 1997) and the processing account of mood (Bless, 2000; Fiedler, 2000) predict that it is sad individuals who should be more susceptible to the anchoring bias. Experiment 1 used a new methodological paradigm, which captures the key methodologies of past mood and anchoring studies to test these two competing hypotheses. The overall results of Experiment 1 found that neither positive nor negative mood influenced the reliance on the anchoring heuristic, but a post-hoc analysis suggests that happy participants relied more on the anchoring heuristic in making decisions for low personal relevance, low familiarity scenarios whereas sad participants were more susceptible to the anchoring heuristic in making high personal relevance, high familiarity decisions. Experiment 2 tested this suggestion and confirmed that personal relevance significantly moderated the effects of mood on the use of the anchoring heuristic. Experiment 3 replicated this result and showed that sad participants processed longer in the high personal relevance condition whereas happy participants were comparably fast in making high and low personal relevance decisions. These findings support the suggestion that it was changes in processing styles that were responsible for the effects of mood and personal relevance on the reliance of the anchoring heuristic. In addition, Experiment 3 found no evidence that familiarity moderated the effects of mood on anchoring. Experiment 4 extended these results to the domain of general knowledge questions but failed to show that an individual difference variable, the Need for Cognition (Cacioppo &amp; Petty, 1982) moderated these effects. The fifth and final experiment extended these findings to a different kind of heuristic, the representativeness heuristic. It was predicted and found that, contrary to the previous results, happy participants relied more on the representativeness heuristic in the high personal relevance condition. These findings have important implications for the theories of mood, judgmental heuristics and decision making under uncertainty.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene expression in healing tendon</field><field name="creator">Molloy, Timothy John, St George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Tendon injury is painful and often debilitating, and is a one of the most prevalent soft tissue injuries encountered in the clinic. While common, the underlying molecular and genetic processes of tendon damage and repair remain poorly understood. The work described herein used genome-wide expression analyses to investigate tendon injury and healing from three perspectives. The first identified novel gene expression in tendon fibroblasts following their stimulation with nitric oxide (NO). Of particular relevance to tendon healing was the observation that stimulated fibroblasts express a number of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes in response to NO in a dose-dependent manner, and that NO significantly affects cellular adhesion, a critical process during tendon repair. These findings will be of use when optimising dosages of NO delivery in future work investigating NO as potential treatment for tendon injuries. The second study examined gene expression in an acute tendon injury model in the rat at 1, 7, and 21 days post injury, roughly representing the inflammation, proliferation, and remodelling phase of wound repair. Several novel genes and pathways were found to be differentially expressed at each stage of healing. Of particular interest were the presence of a significant number of genes related to glutamate signaling, a method of cellular communication that has not previously been shown to exist in tendon. Also upregulated were a number of genes which have previously only been associated with embryonic development. Finally, gene expression in a supraspinatus tendinopathy model in the rat was investigated. Several genetic pathways were identified in tendinopathic tendons which have not previously been associated with the disease, and, analogous to the acute injury model study, glutamate signaling gene overexpression was also prevalent. Further in vitro studies showed that the expression of these genes in tendon fibroblasts were stimulated by glutamate treatment, which in turn upregulated pro-apoptotic pathways causing cell death. This may prove to be an important causative factor in the tendon degeneration seen in tendinopathy, in which apoptosis has been identified as playing a significant role. The results of these studies contribute to a better understanding of the aetiology of several extremely common pathologies of this soft tissue, and may help to develop more targeted therapies for increasing the efficacy of tendon healing in future.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tendon</field><field name="subject">microarray</field><field name="subject">healing</field><field name="subject">orthopaedics</field><field name="subject">glutamate</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23939</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HIV and other sexually transmissible infections in a cohort of HIV negative homosexual men in Sydney</field><field name="creator">Jin, Feng Yi, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents data on incidence and risk factors for individual sexually transmissible infections (STIs) and STIs as risk factors for HIV acquisition in a community-based cohort of HIV negative homosexual men in Sydney. Nearly half of men aged under 25 years were seronegative to hepatitis A and B infection. The prevalence of hepatitis C (HCV) was 0.85%, which was close to that of the general population. HCV infection was strongly associated with injecting drug use (OR 60.43, 95% CI 6.70-544.79), and sexual transmission was not demonstrated in this cohort.  There was a nearly 40 fold increase in syphilis notifications in inner Sydney between 1999 and 2004. The stable incidence of 0.6% per year in the HIM cohort suggests that it was disproportionately affecting HIV positive men.  Oral sex was an important transmission route and about one third of cases were asymptomatic. The incidence of urethral and anal gonorrhoea was 3.78 and 3.19 per 100 person-years, and for urethral and anal chlamydia it was 7.98 and 5.20.  In addition to unprotected anal intercourse (UAI), insertive oral sex was related to urethral infections and anal infections were associated with non-intercourse anal sexual practices. The prevalence of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) was 75% and 23% respectively.  Sexual contact not only with men, but with women, was significantly associated with both infections. Among those susceptible at baseline, the incidence for HSV-1 and HSV-2 was 5.58 and 1.45 per 100 person-years.  Oral sex was associated with incident HSV-1 infection and certain non-intercourse anal sexual practices were significantly associated with incident HSV-2 infection. HIV incidence was 0.94 per 100 person-years. It was significantly associated with a higher number of episodes of receptive UAI with a partner of unknown HIV status (p trend&amp;lt0.001) or a partner known to be HIV positive (p trend&amp;lt0.001). After controlling for sexual behaviour, HIV seroconversion was significantly associated with anal gonorrhoea (HR 12.68, 95% CI 3.66-44.00). The association with anal warts and prevalent HSV-1 infection was of borderline significance.  These data will inform intervention designs targeting STIs which aim to prevent HIV in homosexual men.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gay men -- New South Wales -- Sydney</field><field name="subject">HIV infections -- New South Wales -- Sydney</field><field name="subject">Sexually transmitted diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evidence basis of diving and hyperbaric medicine - a synthesis of the high level clinical evidence with meta-analysis</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Michael Heywood, Prince of Wales Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is the administration of 100% oxygen at pressures greater than 1 atmosphere. One recurrent criticism that has been made of this field is that treatment is based on little or no good clinical evidence.  Aims: The primary objective of this thesis is to make a useful response to that criticism. I planned to collate all the available randomised evidence in the fields of diving and hyperbaric medicine, supply a critical appraisal of each paper, and synthesise that evidence in a series of systematic reviews with meta-analysis. I also intended to use a cost analysis of hyperbaric practice in our own facility to inform formal cost-effectiveness analysis using the estimates of effect generated by the individual meta-analyses.  Methods: A comprehensive search strategy was used to identify all clinical RCTs involving the administration of hyperbaric breathing mixtures. Each trial was appraised using the software developed by the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine. Each critical appraisal was loaded onto a searchable web site at www.hboevidence.com. Each diagnostic category identified was considered for inclusion in a Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis.  Results: The database includes 130 critical appraisals covering 173 separate reports. The site has received more than 17,000 hits. There are 12 formal meta-analytical reviews and all have been accepted for publication in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews at the time of writing. These form the basis of this thesis and include late radiation tissue injury, chronic wounds, acute hearing loss and tinnitus, multiple sclerosis and decompression illness. The meta-analyses in this thesis suggest there are several areas where HBOT is associated with improved clinical outcomes and that routine use is probably justified in some areas (e.g. radiation proctitis healing with HBOT: NNT 3, 95%CI 2 to 11). On the other hand, these analyses suggest there is most unlikely to be significant clinical benefit from the application of HBOT to patients currently referred for HBOT (e.g. multiple sclerosis). Conclusions: The randomised evidence for the use of HBOT is now significantly easier to access. Recommendations for therapy and future research directions can be made on the basis of these analyses.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hyperbaric oxygenation</field><field name="subject">Oxygen therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Market orientation and Guanxi in Chinese business enterprises - substitutes or complements?</field><field name="creator">Chen, Shu, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Do western management practices and beliefs and Chinese business practices complement or substitute each other in the emerging world of Chinese business? This thesis explores the interaction between two central ideas in western and Chinese thinking about the way business should be done ??? between the western emphasis on market orientation as the key to profitable growth, and the Chinese reliance on traditional networks embodied in the concept of guanxi. These two variables are embedded in a broader model of strategic decision making in order to identify moderating factors that may influence performance outcomes. Following pretests and in-depth interviews, in 2003 a sample of 152 businesses was drawn in Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang area from two industries, the electronics industry and the textile/garment industry. Low response rates and a small sample were two important limiting factors. Two broad analytical approaches were used. The first made use of graphical smoothing methodology, an approach that facilitates the identification of complex non-linear interactions among the variables. The second used Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) where a linear structure is imposed on the relationships among the variables, allowing simultaneous consideration of the full variable set together with an analysis of fit and measurement error, while the graphical smoothing non-linear method was effectively limited to three variables at a time. The graphical analysis suggested the existence of nonlinearities in many relationships, and found a positive interaction between guanxi and market orientation in influencing performance, and that both were in that sense complements rather than substitutes. The SEM analysis suggested that while there were some indirect links between guanxi, market orientation and performance, these were relatively weak, (although the use of guanxi with other managers was a factor in market orientation), and that the primary driver of performance was the strength of the competitive advantage possessed by the firm. This factor directly impacted market orientation, indirectly affected guanxi and accounted for much of the observed correlation between the two cultural variables, guanxi and market orientation, and performance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From the 'New Wave' to the 'Unnameable': post-dramatic theatre &amp; Australia in the 1980s &amp; 1990s</field><field name="creator">Hamilton, Margaret, School of Media, Film &amp; Theatre, UNSW</field><field name="description">The object of this dissertation is to re-assess Australian examples of ???performance??? in light of discourses and directions in dramaturgy that have emerged since the 1970s internationally. The thesis applies Hans-Thies Lehmann???s comprehensive theory of post-dramatic theatre to explicate examples of departures from dramatic theatre in view of the expansive field of inquiry implied by the description ???performance??? or ???new media arts??? and general cultural-political theory. To examine the de-centralisation of text specific to post-dramatic theatre the dissertation analyses firstly, material devised collaboratively at all stages of creative development in its case studies of the Sydney based companies The Sydney Front (1986-1993) and Open City (1987 -); and secondly, Heiner M??ller???s concept of ???literature??? written for the theatre and in opposition to its convention. In addition, the analysis of M??ller serves as an introduction to a comparative analysis of a dramatic (literary) theatre project by a group of Aboriginal artists based on a post-dramatic text by M??ller. This dissertation endeavours to contribute to documentation on post-dramatic theatre in Australia and more broadly, to conceptions of contemporary forms of dramaturgy. More specifically, the thesis argues that dramaturgy no longer necessarily concerns the identification of an aesthetic locus that explicitly explicates the audience???s relation to a known macrocosm. Instead, the thesis conceives of dramaturgy as a compositional strategy that can be thought of within the bounds of Aristotle???s perfunctory visual dimension ???opsis??? and elaborated upon in terms of Kristeva???s theory of the ???thetic??? as regulating ???semiotic??? incursions into the ???symbolic??? order. In doing so, the thesis proposes the concept of a ???televisual??? and an ???abject??? dramaturgy, the latter on the basis of a relation to the older tradition of carnival and identifies a link between intertextuality (transposition) and dramaturgical strategies that engage the spectator in the theatre situation and the dissolution of logocentric hierarchy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Experimental theater</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tests of the Solow efficiency wage model using Australian aggregate industry and macro economic time series data</field><field name="creator">Chand, Jatin, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis assesses the efficiency wage hypothesis using Australian industry and macro economic time series data by focussing on two questions: whether paying an above market clearing wage called the efficiency wage raises industry output and productivity, and if such a payment causes unemployment at the macro economic level. The wageproductivity or wage-output nexus is investigated using three techniques; namely a decomposition procedure used by Huang, Halam, Orazem, and Paterno (1998), an instrumental variable estimation method, and the Solow residuals approach. Further, an examination of macro economic unemployment involves developing an aggregate unemployment equation, where the Solow (1979) model is used to derive a testable hypothesis. The Solow model argues that effort, which is a function of the wage, enters the production function when the real wage is rigid. By introducing profit maximising behaviour and making further economic assumptions, the Solow condition that the effort elasticity with respect to the wage is one can be derived. The theoretical framework of Solow is useful as specifying a production function allows the possibility of aggregate data being used to assess the wage-productivity prediction. The Solow condition is also useful because it provides the basis for constructing a testable hypothesis using an unemployment equation. Solow???s theoretical framework and the Solow condition does not rely on the economic assumptions of the shirking, labour turnover, sociological and adverse selection [micro economic] efficiency wage models. Therefore, the innovation of this thesis is to treat the efficiency wage hypothesis as an imperfectly competitive model of the labour market using applied macro economic methods. Previous Australian macro economic literature in the 1970s and 1980s have argued that the wage is either harmful to employment prospects (ie unemployment is classical), or that factors such as consumption and investment are more important (ie unemployment is Keynesian). One of the aims of the thesis is to use the empirical analysis to suggest that neither of these propositions is entirely correct. Rather, an intermediate position is arrived at by arguing that there is some empirical evidence in Australian industry and macro economic time series data to suggest that the wage plays a dual function: both as a small source of productivity and also a minor cause of involuntary unemployment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wages - Australia</field><field name="subject">Productivity</field><field name="subject">Unemployment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insider trading law in China: regulations of insider trading in China and proposals for reform</field><field name="creator">Huang, Hui, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purposes of this thesis are threefold: (1) to investigate the incidence of insider trading in China; (2) to critically examine the regulation of insider trading in China within the Chinese context; and (3) to set out reform proposals. At present, insider trading is a very serious issue in China as it presents a major obstacle to the development of China???s securities market. This thesis is therefore of both theoretical and practical significance. Based on both theoretical arguments and empirical findings, this thesis investigates the extent of insider trading in China, explains why insider trading occurs in China, and examines the harmful and allegedly beneficial effects of insider trading. Insider trading is found to be widespread and widely considered to be harmful in China. This accounts for the fact that China has shown a great willingness to follow the international trend to regulate insider trading. Indeed, with the benefit of overseas experience, China has made a remarkable achievement in establishing its insider trading regulatory regime within a relatively short period of time. Despite this, there are a number of major problems with this regulatory regime, mainly due to the adoption of foreign ideas without due criticism. This is illustrated by various loopholes found in the definition of what is an ???insider???, which are related to confusion over underlying theories of insider trading liability. The thesis conducts an indepth analysis of these theories on a comparative law basis, recommending that the equality of access theory and the Australian ???information connection??? only approach are better suited to China. The thesis also examines other basic elements of insider trading, including the concept of materiality, the issue of when information becomes public, and the subjective elements of insider trading. Furthermore, a detailed discussion is carried out concerning the issue of private civil liability for insider trading. It is submitted that the combination of the nondisclosure-period-traders approach and well-designed damage caps can best ensure that private actions serve as a necessary and appropriate force in the enforcement of insider trading law.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">insider trading in securities</field><field name="subject">law and legislation</field><field name="subject">China.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and characterisation of polypyrrole composites</field><field name="creator">Meure, Samuel James, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The development and characterisation of new PPy composites has been carried out using direct addition of polypyrrole (PPy) powders to polymeric substrates and in situ polymerisation in order to develop workable composites with conductivities similar to that of oxidised PPy. Precipitation, dispersion and emulsion polymerisation techniques were used in the development of PPy fillers. Electron microscopy, differential light scattering (DLS), nitrogen adsorption surface area analysis and conductivity measurements were used to determine the physical properties of PPy powders produced with ferric chloride oxidant. Powders possessing approximately 380-1400nm effective particle diameters, 8-50m2 surface areas and 0.001-1S/cm conductivities were produced. Physically mixed composites were produced by adding PPy powders to Surlyn ionomer, styrene ethylene butylene styrene triblock copolymers (SEBS) and nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) hosts. Changes in physical properties (including tensile strength and electrical conductivity) of PPy and carbon black filled composites were also studied and compared. In situ polymerisation-based composite development of PPy composites with higher conductivities than obtained using physical mixing techniques (&amp;lt10-4S/cm) was carried out. Sequential treatments with monomer and oxidant were used to test the combination of polymer host (including those described above) and reaction media (including tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether and acetonitrile). Examination of PPy penetration and content (using optical microscopy and gravimetric analysis) showed a diethyl ether reaction media and SEBS host were suitable for further PPy Abstract composite development. The simultaneous diffusion polymerisation (SDP) technique, which involves treating opposite sides of host sheets with separate monomer and oxidant solutions, was employed to form PPy- SEBS composites. The layered morphology of SDP-formed composites was characterised by techniques including X-ray imaging, Raman mapping and electron probe microchemical analysis; and a PPy growth mechanism proposed. Optimisation of PPy composite properties was carried out using a central composite factorial design (varying reagent concentrations, reaction temperatures and reaction times) with conductivities of approximately 1S/cm achieved, Properties of PPy composites formed using physical mixing and SDP techniques were compared. Preliminary investigations (using electron and atomic force microscopy) were carried out to develop core-shell PPy composites that possess a continuous PPy component rather than the layered morphology associated with reductions in tensile strength.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pyrrole</field><field name="subject">polymeric composotes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance differences between normal and low arched feet in 9 - 12 year old children</field><field name="creator">Twomey, Dara, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the past people were excluded from military service and many children suffered under the stigma of having flat feet. Flat feet have been a very popular area of research for years, yet many unresolved issues still exist. There appears to be no universally accepted definition of normal arch height within the general population, which leads to difficulty in identifying and classifying flat feet. A reduced arch appears to have an effect on human movement but the extent of this in dynamic movement remains undefined. The primary aim of this project was to investigate if there were differences in performance of basic gross motor skills between normal and low arched feet in 9 ??? 12 year old children. The principal measurement technique proposed was more accurate than previous studies and permitted an in-depth analysis of the foot in dynamic situations. This three-dimensional foot analysis facilitated a greater understanding of the biomechanics of the foot. The research was undertaken in three phases. The initial phase classified approximately one hundred children???s feet for inclusion in the subsequent phases. Static footprints and dynamic arch height measurement were recorded. The second phase comprised of three-dimensional foot analysis, and basic functional tasks including, jumping, balancing, and hopping undertaken with thirty children; fifteen low and fifteen normal arched. An additional twenty-four children participated in the third and final phase, which included a lower limb gait analysis with strength and proprioception tests in addition to the tests in phase two. Kinematically the low arched foot had a significantly lower medial arch angle and a reduced forefoot pronation angle throughout the gait cycle. This research also found that they had a more externally rotated hip particularly during the stance phase of gait. Functionally there were remarkably few differences between the two groups. The low arched group had significantly reduced performance in lateral hopping. However they showed stronger plantar flexion strength, and performed better in the vertical jumping task. It can be concluded from this research that there is no major disadvantage to performance of gross motor skills for the children in this project with low arched asymptomatic feet.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flatfoot.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improvements to the performance of membrane systems by applying collapsible-tube-induced pulsatile flow</field><field name="creator">Wang, Wanxin, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The major drawback of crossflow membrane filtration is that permeate flux declines with time as a result of the increase in total membrane resistance.  Pulsatile flow is well known to reduce the resistance and enhance permeate flux.  This study applied pulsatile flow induced by the oscillation of a collapsible tube to microfiltration and ultrafiltration, to improve filtration performance expressed as permeate flux enhancement and backflushable resistance reduction.  Three membranes (ceramic tubular microfiltration, PVDF spiral-wound microfiltration and PS hollow-fibre ultrafiltration) and two media (bentonite suspension and whey solution) were used. In bentonite pulsatile microfiltration with the tubular membrane, up to 300% of permeate flux enhancement and 90% of backflushable resistance reduction were achieved.  In bentonite and whey pulsatile microfiltration with the spiral-wound membrane, moderate improvements were gained: for bentonite, the highest increase in permeate flux was 51% and decrease in backflushable resistance was 45%; for whey, the highest permeate flux enhancement and backflushable resistance reduction were 36% and 38% respectively.  In ultrafiltration of both media, no significant performance improvement was found.  This is thought due in the one case to the relatively minute membrane pore size, and in the other to the large irreversible resistance created by whey solution. Transmural pressure at the collapsible tube downstream end indicates the tube compression and influences the pulsation vigour.  Increasing the transmural pressure was an effective way to improve filtration performance.  In bentonite microfiltration with the tubular membrane, increasing crossflow velocity was also effective, but increasing transmembrane pressure was not. Analysis of pulsatility parameters showed that the pulsatile flow always resulted in enhanced wall shear, and induced pore backflush always in the tubular membrane and sometimes in the HF membrane.  These mechanistic findings helped to understand the filtration performance improvements. The analysis of energy consumption in bentonite microfiltration with the tubular membrane clearly demonstrated the benefit of applying the collapsible-tube-induced pulsatile flow in energy utilisation.  The system specific energy could be reduced more than 70 % relative to the equivalent steady microfiltration permeate flux.  For a given specific energy, the permeate flux could be increased by a factor of nearly four.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microfiltration</field><field name="subject">pulsatile flow</field><field name="subject">bentonite</field><field name="subject">energy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proposals for the reform of the taxation of goodwill in Australia</field><field name="creator">Walpole, Michael, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the Australian approach to taxation of goodwill and related intangibles.  It asks the questions: 'Is the current Australian approach to taxation of goodwill coherent?'; and 'Could a different approach minimise any distortions?' The thesis identifies the increasing importance of goodwill and other intangible property in a modern information-based economy.  It identifies benchmarks for a 'good' tax system ??? such as efficiency, simplicity, and equity.  It emphasises the criteria of simplicity and efficiency but includes other criteria and specifically considers the issue of alignment of accounting and legal concepts.  It concludes that the current misalignment makes it difficult for the tax system to deal with goodwill coherently. The thesis criticises the treatment of goodwill under various Australian taxes, including stamp duty; Goods and Services Tax; taxation of capital gains; and income tax.  It specifically considers the treatment of intangible sources of goodwill and their relationship with goodwill itself.  The discussion of income tax pays particular attention to the role of goodwill and other intangibles in international transfer pricing.  The thesis draws conclusions about the treatment of goodwill in Australia and whether the Australian approach meets the benchmarks established at the outset.  The thesis demonstrates that the current Australian approach leads, inter alia, to tax avoidance.  The current approach also offends a number of other criteria of a 'good' system.  The thesis considers the UK tax treatment of intangibles held by resident companies and considers this model for Australia.  It also considers the abandoned 'Tax Value Method' previously proposed for Australia.  From this and other material, it suggests possible new directions and an alternative approach to taxing goodwill in Australia.  These include a consistent and coherent definition of goodwill for tax that is compatible with law and accounting.  The thesis also urges the development of a consistent approach to taxing goodwill at both the state and federal levels; and suggests greater reliance on the existence of goodwill as a means to establish jurisdiction to impose tax in international tax situations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">goodwill</field><field name="subject">income tax</field><field name="subject">capital gains tax</field><field name="subject">GST</field><field name="subject">permanent establishment</field><field name="subject">duty</field><field name="subject">stamp duty</field><field name="subject">intangibles</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Happy and gullible, sad and wise? Mood effects on factual and interpersonal skepticism.</field><field name="creator">East, Rebekah, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this research was to examine the influence of temporary mood states on factual and interpersonal skepticism. Based on recent affect-cognition theorising and research on credibility judgment, 7 studies predicted that negative moods increase and positive moods decrease skepticism, because of the information-processing consequences of these affective states. First, three studies examined the influence of mood on factual skepticism toward urban myths and legends (Study 1) and novel and familiar general knowledge claims (Studies 2-3). Contrary to predictions, Study 1 found that sad participants were less skeptical than happy participants towards urban legends, possibly due to the negative valence of the claims. Because the feeling of familiarity has been shown to be an important determinant of truth, Studies 2-3 examined the influence of mood and familiarity on skepticism. Consistent with information processing theories of mood, happy participants were more likely than sad participants to give credence to familiar general knowledge claims (Study 2), even when given explicit feedback about their actual truth or falsity during initial exposure to claims (Study 3). The remainder of this thesis extended these findings to interpersonal judgments. Studies 4-5 found that sad participants were more skeptical of the genuineness of facial expressions of emotion compared to happy participants. Studies 6-7 examined whether sad participants might also show greater lie detection accuracy. In Study 6, happy, sad and neutral-mood participants judged the credibility of targets honestly or deceptively describing their emotional reaction to an affectively-laden film, but no evidence was found of mood induced differences in deception detection accuracy. However, in Study 7, sad participants were more skeptical than happy participants about the veracity of videotaped individuals honestly or deceptively denying their involvement in a mock crime (a theft), and showed greater accuracy at discerning lies from truths. This dissertation contributes to the affect-cognition literature by demonstrating that not only may sad moods lead people to be more skeptical, but they may also confer an advantage at detecting deception. The implications of these findings for everyday credibility judgment and for contemporary theories of affect and cognition are considered.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">affect</field><field name="subject">credibility judgment</field><field name="subject">detecting deception</field><field name="subject">mood and information processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of late-developing learning and memory systems in rats: fear-potentiated startle and context-specific latent inhibition and extinction</field><field name="creator">Yap, Carol Sue Lynn, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Eleven experiments examined two late-developing learning and memory systems in rats: fear-potentiated startle (FPS) and the contextual regulation of latent inhibition and extinction.  The first study was based on three previous developmental findings on FPS: (1) FPS to an odour CS emerges at postnatal day (PN) 23; Rats conditioned at PN16 to an odour CS express freezing but not FPS when tested at PN23, and (3) FPS to an odour CS trained at PN16 is activated if rats are also trained to a difference odour at PN23 (Yap, Stapinski, &amp; Richardson, 2005).  Yap et al. (2005) hypothesised that the activation effect only occurs if rats are given training to the second odour at an age when FPS has emerged.  Study 1 assessed this hypothesis and trained the second odour CS at either PN23 or PN20.  Contrary to expectations, the results of this study showed the activation effect for both groups of rats.  Surprisingly, the results also revealed a significant FPS effect to the odour CS trained at PN20.  Subsequent experiments examined this unexpected result, and found that learning to odour 1 at PN16 facilitated the age of onset for FPS at PN20.  The results of Study 1 are discussed in relation to past findings on enrichment, cumulative learning, and neurobiological models of conditioned fear.  The second section of this thesis (Studies 2 and 3) examined the context-specificity of two memory interference paradigms, latent inhibition and extinction, in developing rats.  The studies found that both phenomena were context-specific at PN23-25 but not at PN16-18.  Moreover, the results suggest that the context-specificity of both latent inhibition depended on the age of the rat during the second phase of training, but not their age during the first phase of training or their age at test.  The implications of these findings for theoretical and neural models of learning, as well as the occurrence of latent inhibition and extinction during development are discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="subject">developmental</field><field name="subject">pups</field><field name="subject">conditioned fear</field><field name="subject">freezing</field><field name="subject">fear-potentiated startle</field><field name="subject">latent inhibition</field><field name="subject">extinction</field><field name="subject">context</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of environmental factors on gastric cancer in the Northwest of Iran</field><field name="creator">Pourfarzi, Farhad, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background: Despite a declining trend in the incidence of gastric cancer (GC), it is still a major global public health concern of the 21st century. It afflicts one million people and kills 750,000 annually. It is believed that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the gastric carcinogenesis. However geographic variation and immigrant studies highlight the role of environmental factors. Objective: To evaluate the association of GC with the environmental factors of diet, helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, lifestyle and occupation as well as family history in Iran. Methodology: A population based case-control study was conducted in the Northwest of Iran where one of the highest incidence rates of the world has been reported. Two hundred and seventeen cases of GC and 394 age and gender matched controls were recruited. Participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire which elicited information on demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, family and medical history, lifestyle (smoking, alcohol drinking and substance abuse) and occupation. Ten milliliters of each subject???s blood was collected for blood grouping and to investigate presence of IgG antibodies against H. pylori using an ELISA kit which had been locally validated for this study. Results: Diet and H. pylori infection were found to be the most important determinants of GC in this study. High intake of allium vegetables and fruit, especially citrus fruit, appears to play a protective role. In addition to the consumption of fruit and vegetables, consumption of fresh fish was also inversely associated with GC. On the other, hand consumption of red meat and dairy products were positively associated with the risk of GC. Other dietary practices were also found to be important factors in the etiology of GC. People who had a preference for higher salt intake and drinking strong and hot tea were at higher risk. Finally, H. pylori infection was found to increase the risk of GC. Conclusion: This study has provided important and original information about the etiology of gastric cancer particularly in the Iranian context. These findings could be used in planning preventive strategies for this malignancy, which is a major health problem in Iran.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gastric cancer</field><field name="subject">case control</field><field name="subject">Helicobacter pylori</field><field name="subject">ELISA</field><field name="subject">occupation</field><field name="subject">lifestyle</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24844</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of sustainability reporting by companies in the Australian coal mining industry to public &amp; regulatory audiences</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Alyssa, Mining, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the lead-up to the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002, several documents were published by the mining industry declaring the important role that public sustainability reporting had to play in driving sustainable development and pointing to the Global Reporting Initiative???s (GRI) 2002 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines as a suitable vehicle for this. With the aim of finding ways to improve the quantity and quality of public sustainability reporting within the Australian coal mining industry, this study set out to investigate the current sustainability reporting practices of companies involved in the industry. A survey was conducted of the public financial and non-financial reporting practices of all companies with a significant interest in a New South Wales or Queensland coal mine. Three survey cycles were completed covering the 2001, 2002 and 2003 calendar years and the 2001/02, 2002/03 and 2003/04 financial years. The reporting practices were determined both in terms of frequency of report production and contents of reports. A GRI-based content analysis tool was used to measure the amount of sustainability information contained in the company reports. It was found that only around a quarter of companies produced a nonfinancial report and that almost half did not produce any public reports, with the number of unlisted companies publicly reporting particularly low. Whilst a wide range of reporting practices were observed with regard to content, the frequency of Economic, Environmental and Social Performance Indicators in reports was generally found to be low. An investigation of the regulatory reporting requirements on companies was then conducted to determine what sustainability information companies could report with data that they already had at hand. The same GRI-based content analysis tool was used to analyse a variety of regulatory documents. It was found that companies did not publicly disclose a significant amount of the environmental data that they are required to report to regulators. The study also evaluated the reporting capacity of non-reporters and found that, with the exception of Governance Structure and Management Systems elements, large unlisted companies had similar regulatory reporting requirements to listed companies.  However, smaller unlisted companies had fewer requirements to report Profile and Economic elements. Finally, the influences of company ownership structure, non-financial reporting status, industrial sector, nationality and participation in voluntary initiatives on sustainability reporting practices were investigated. It was concluded that in order for public sustainability reporting to be a useful tool in driving sustainable development, focus needed to shift from ???best practice??? to ???common practice??? so that a critical mass of reporters is amassed to allow benchmarking of performance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public Sustainability Reporting</field><field name="subject">CSR</field><field name="subject">Mining</field><field name="subject">GRI</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24850</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Atomically controlled device fabrication using STM</field><field name="creator">Ruess, Frank Joachim, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">We present the development of a novel, UHV-compatible device fabrication strategy for the realisation of nano- and atomic-scale devices in silicon by harnessing the atomic-resolution capability of a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM).  We develop etched registration markers in the silicon substrate in combination with a custom-designed STM/ molecular beam epitaxy system (MBE) to solve one of the key problems in STM device fabrication ??? connecting devices, fabricated in UHV, to the outside world. Using hydrogen-based STM lithography in combination with phosphine, as a dopant source, and silicon MBE, we then go on to fabricate several planar Si:P devices on one chip, including control devices that demonstrate the efficiency of each stage of the fabrication process.  We demonstrate that we can perform four terminal magnetoconductance measurements at cryogenic temperatures after ex-situ alignment of metal contacts to the buried device. Using this process, we demonstrate the lateral confinement of P dopants in a delta-doped plane to a line of width 90nm; and observe the cross-over from 2D to 1D magnetotransport. These measurements enable us to extract the wire width which is in excellent agreement with STM images of the patterned wire.  We then create STM-patterned Si:P wires with widths from 90nm to 8nm that show ohmic conduction and low resistivities of 1 to 20 micro Ohm-cm respectively ??? some of the highest conductivity wires reported in silicon. We study the dominant scattering mechanisms in the wires and find that temperature-dependent magnetoconductance can be described by a combination of both 1D weak localisation and 1D electron-electron interaction theories with a potential crossover to strong localisation at lower temperatures.  We present results from STM-patterned tunnel junctions with gap sizes of 50nm and 17nm exhibiting clean, non-linear characteristics. We also present preliminary conductance results from a 70nm long and 90nm wide dot between source-drain leads which show evidence of Coulomb blockade behaviour. The thesis demonstrates the viability of using STM lithography to make devices in silicon down to atomic-scale dimensions. In particular, we show the enormous potential of this technology to directly correlate images of the doped regions with ex-situ electrical device characteristics.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">scanning tunneling microscopy</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="subject">quantum devices</field><field name="subject">nanoelectronics</field><field name="subject">doping</field><field name="subject">registration markers</field><field name="subject">STM device fabrication</field><field name="subject">quantum computer</field><field name="subject">single atom electronics</field><field name="subject">tunnel junctions</field><field name="subject">nanowires</field><field name="subject">quantum dots</field><field name="subject">metal dots</field><field name="subject">weak localisation</field><field name="subject">strong localisation</field><field name="subject">phosphine</field><field name="subject">dephasing</field><field name="subject">electron transport</field><field name="subject">magnetotransport</field><field name="subject">planar device architecture</field><field name="subject">low temeperature measurements</field><field name="subject">Coulomb blockade</field><field name="subject">STM</field><field name="subject">electron electron interactions</field><field name="subject">dimensioncal crossover</field><field name="subject">ultra high vacuum</field><field name="subject">hydrogen resist</field><field name="subject">lithography</field><field name="subject">STM lithography</field><field name="subject">molecular adsorption</field><field name="subject">electrical dopant activation</field><field name="subject">disordered electron systems</field><field name="subject">electron phase coherence length</field><field name="subject">photon assisted carrier generation</field><field name="subject">tunnelling</field><field name="subject">delta doping</field><field name="subject">molecular beam epitaxy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Passive smoking and acute respiratory illness in childhood</field><field name="creator">Woodward, Alistair.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 215-236</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Passive smoking Case studies</field><field name="subject">Pediatric respiratory diseases Case studies</field><field name="subject">Tobacco habit Treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phw899.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:6023686</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing IT outsourcing relationships to enhance outcomes: cases in a cross-cultural context</field><field name="creator">Wu, Wei, School of Information Technology, Systems, &amp; Management, UNSW</field><field name="description">Information Technology (IT) outsourcing is a serious option available to modern managers. An emerging trend is the focus on relationship management in IT outsourcing, imploring organisations to look past tactical objectives and concentrate on strategic outcomes. In a global economy business sponsors are connecting with overseas vendors in IT outsourcing in an attempt to accelerate realisation of benefits. This complicates outsourcing arrangements, because cross-cultural differences may add to the complexity of fostering relationships. This study examines how to manage IT outsourcing relationships in a cross-cultural context to enhance IT outsourcing success. Due to the exploratory nature of this study, interpretivist case studies were adopted. The researcher investigated three IT outsourcing cases within one Chinese organisation. One case has a vendor with a western cultural background and the other two with a Chinese cultural background. The main data were collected through interviews with key managers in the case organisation, complemented by secondary data (such as published reports, internal documents). Some additional data concerning the cross-cultural differences were also collected from the two Chinese vendors and another western vendor who provided corporate strategy consulting services to the case organisation.  Analysis of data showed that a good contract implementation, the established trust and the acknowledgement of vendor's high value were recognised as the three distinguishing characteristics of a satisfactory IT outsourcing relationship. In managing relationships the outsourcing company emphasised not only contract implementation but even more importantly communication with vendors, recognition of mutual interests, establishment of social/personal bonds, and appropriate allocation of project resources. It was shown that the relationship management practices influenced the dynamics of a relationship as well as the outcome of an IT outsourcing project. Furthermore, the relationship management in IT outsourcing was found to be culture-sensitive. By demonstrating that companies with different cultural background held different perceptions of relationship management practices and had different understandings of the nature and dynamics of the relationships, this study contributes to the understanding of relationship management in IT outsourcing, especially when cultural differences among the parties are involved. These findings also have practical implications for IT outsourcing involving global and partner-based alliances.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IT Outsourcing</field><field name="subject">Relationship management</field><field name="subject">Cross-cultural differences</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25694</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The golden thread : the search for love and truth in Shirley Hazzard's writings</field><field name="creator">Twidale, Kathleen M.

Human beings have colonized several planets with help from the enigmatic and more technologically advanced Zhir, who gave spaceships and habitable worlds to those they deemed suitable  and their descendants. The Joint Expeditionary Force is the military arm of the Universal Faith, called in when conflicts arise that the Faith decides are beyond the local government and militia and require their intervention. Leneveldt and Roader are JEF officers assigned to Operation Techronomicon, investigating what seems to be a Zhir-built defence shield around the planet Lassana. Another JEF company sent to Kalaabhavan after the murder of the planets Confessor-General loses its CO to a land-mine, and Lieutenant Hellerman reluctantly accepts command. Chevalier, a civilian pilot, takes refugees fleeing military-run detention camps on Ararat to a biological research station on otherwise uninhabited Lila. The biologists on Lila discover a symbiote that enables humans to photosynthesize, which comes to the attention of Operation Techronomicon and the JEF's Weapons Research Division. Leneveldt and Roeder, frustrated by the lack of progress on Lassana, are sent to Lila to detain the biologists, who flee into the swamps. Hellerman's efforts to restore peace on Kalaabhavan are frustrated by the Confessors, and his company finds itself besieged by insurgents.

Botulinum Toxin A(BoNT-A) therapy for upper limb spasticity management in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy(CP) is currently under trial. Despite its use for over a decade for lower limb spasticity, little is known about the mechanisms involved in improving motor function and the effect on the child and their familys HRQOL. Both central and peripheral mechanisms are hypothesised[1]. Whilst evidence of improved quality of movement and ability to perform tasks is emerging[2-4], this cannot be directly correlated with an improvement in HRQOL. In addition, the traditional method of assessing child HRQOL by parent proxy reports has come under question[5, 6]. The World Health Organisation now recommends the collection of both parent proxy and child self-reports[7]. Aims: 1. Investigate the corticomotor projections to the upper limb in school aged children with hemiplegic CP and the changes that occur with BoNT-A therapy by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). 2. Investigate the effect of upper limb BoNT-A therapy on HRQOL of school aged children with hemiplegic CP by completion of the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales and 3.0 CP Module. 3. Determine the concordance between Child Self-Report and Parent Proxy Report scores for the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales and 3.0 CP Module. 4. Determine the concordance between PedsQL scores and function as assessed by the Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function (MUUL). Methods: Design: Prospective randomised pilot study. Setting: Department of Paediatric Rehabilitation, Princess Margaret Hospital, and Centre for Neurological and Neuromuscular Disorders, Perth. Participants: 22 school aged children with hemiplegic CP aged 7yr 0mth-13yr 11mth (12 treatment, 10 control). 3 Treatment: One episode BoNT-A injections (dose 1-2U/kg/muscle) into the upper limb for treatment group. The control group received usual care. ... Conclusion: This pilot study provides preliminary evidence of the effects of upper limb BoNT-A therapy at both a central physiological and a broader quality of life level in school aged children with hemiplegic CP. At a central level, corticomotor pathway reorganisation occurs in the setting of BoNT-A. However the reorganisation is not limited to the affected side pathways suggesting a systemic BoNT-A effect or developmental changes. Similarly, in this pilot study, there was no statistically significant effect of upper limb BoNT-A on the childs HRQOL as assessed by the PedsQL although positive trends were observed 4 for a number of physical and psychosocial domains. The collection of both child self-report and parent proxy reports when assessing HRQOL is recommended, and function needs to be assessed independently. Larger studies across the broader CP population, the design of CP specific HRQOL tools appropriate for use in the higher functioning CP cohort, and alternative better tolerated methods of investigating the motor system in children with movement disorders are recommended.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arm -- Movements</field><field name="subject">Botulinum toxin -- Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Cerebral palsied children -- Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Cerebral palsy -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Quality of life</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0123</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Claim dependence in credibility models</field><field name="creator">Yeo, Keng Leong, Actuarial Studies, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Existing credibility models have mostly allowed for one source of claim dependence only, that across time for an individual insured risk or a group of homogeneous insured risks. Numerous circumstances demonstrate that this may be inadequate and insufficient. In this dissertation, we developed a two-level common effects model, based loosely on the Bayesian model, which allows for two possible sources of dependence, that across time for the same individual risk and that between risks. For the case of Normal common effects, we are able to derive explicit formulas for the credibility premium. This takes the intuitive form of a weighted average between the individual risk's claims experience, the group's claims experience and the prior mean. We also consider the use of copulas, a tool widely used in other areas of work involving dependence, in constructing credibility premiums. Specifically, we utilise copulas to model the dependence across time for an individual risk or group of homogeneous risks. We develop the construction with several well-known families of copulas and are able to derive explicit formulas for their respective conditional expectations. Whilst some recent work has been done on constructing credibility models with copulas, explicit formulas for the conditional expectations have rarely been made available. Finally, we calibrate these copula credibility models using a real data set. This data set relates to the claims experience of workers' compensation insurance by occupation over a 7-year period for a particular state in the United States. Our results show that for each occupation, claims dependence across time is indeed present. Amongst the copulas considered in our empirical analysis, the Cook-Johnson copula model is found to be the best fit for the data set used. The calibrated copula models are then used for prediction of the next period's claims. We found that the Cook-Johnson copula model gives superior predictions. Furthermore, this calibration exercise allowed us to uncover the importance of examining the nature of the data and comparing it with the characteristics of the copulas we are calibrating to.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Credibility theory (Insurance)</field><field name="subject">Risk assessment - Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25971</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tragic sublime: libidinal pessimism and the problem of existence</field><field name="creator">Elbourne, Sean G., School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis I explore the attempt by Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche and Georges Bataille to confront the problem of the meaning and value of existence. I consider each of these philosophers as involved in the development of a stream of post-Kantian thought that, following Nick Land, I call libidinal pessimism. Libidinal pessimism is both the metaphysical principle of the primacy of willing as the fundamental reality, and the moral principle that the greatest value to our existence is to be found in liberating willing from the small-scale concern of the good of individual beings. Each sees a crisis in the dominance of optimism: the belief that willing is commensurate with the good of individuated beings. They attack the dominance of optimism not just in the history of philosophy, but also in the values that dominate the culture at large. My contention is that these thinkers were provoked to think about the meaning and value of existence by encountering the tragic sublime: a pleasure in the destruction of the happiness of the individual. This affective intensity provokes them to the realisation that our will is not directed towards the happiness of the individual, contra the dominant values of our culture. Yet since the tragic sublime is non-conceptual, its implications for the meaning and the value of existence are not explicit. The task of philosophy is to conceptualise this affective intensity to specify the inadequacy of the values that dominate the age, and to assert the values that can liberate human possibility from its current wretchedness to a new glory. To structure the thinking of these philosophers on the problem of existence, I analyse their thinking using the following logical model: 1) specifying what they regard as the predominant symptoms of the problem regarding existence, our current wretchedness; 2) their diagnosis of the source of this wretchedness in the dominant optimism; 3) their pronouncement of the solution to this problem, through liberating willing from the small-scale; and 4) their prescription for how to overcome this problem, for how the tragic sublime can liberate willing from the fetters of a concern for individuated beings. In elaborating upon the thinking of these philosophers as a definite stream of post- Kantian thought, I also highlight how each engages with the thinking of the earlier of the philosophers. I explore how Schopenhauer's philosophy develops out of Kant's philosophy, how Nietzsche develops the thinking of Schopenhauer and how Bataille develops the problematics of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. Through this I attempt to explore how these three philosophers mark a development in the attempt to conceptualise the tragic sublime as the key to address the problem of the meaning and value of existence.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ontology</field><field name="subject">Nietzsche</field><field name="subject">Schopenhauer</field><field name="subject">Bataille</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hardware implementation of V-BLAST MIMO</field><field name="creator">Sobhanmanesh, Fariborz, School of Electrical Engineering And Telecommunications, UNSW</field><field name="description">The exploitation of the theoretically enormous capacity achieved by the multiple transmit and receive antennas systems (MIMO) in a rich scattering communication channel has been the subject of vast body of research on the field of MIMO. In particular, the Vertically-layered Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time (V-BLAST) is a well known MIMO architecture which has demonstrated the enormous capacity of 20-40 bit/s/Hz in an indoor propagation environment with realistic SNR and error rates. However, due to the intensive computation involved, it would be difficult to implement this architecture for high data rate communication systems. Some works have been done to improve the receiver complexity and performance by coding techniques, by different detection architectures. In this thesis, we have focused on QR-based decoders for V-BLAST MIMO. For a suitable V-BLAST detection implementation, we need to carefully consider the problem from algorithmic, arithmetic and architectural aspects. At the algorithmic level, the numerical stability and robustness should be considered. At the arithmetic level, signal quantization is important, and, at the architectural level, parallelism and pipelining require attention. We have performed the above mentioned optimization on the 1-pass QR factorization with back substitution SIC (Symbol Interference Cancellation) decoder in chapter 3. At first optimizations are made on the proposed algorithm and architecture using MATLAB simulations. Then a new architecture for the QR-factorizer as the core processor of the V-BLAST decoder is developed in chapter 4. This architecture uses only two low complexity CORDIC (Coordinate rotation digital computer) processors.  The parameterized feature of the controller and address generator blocks of this architecture has provided a scalable architecture for the implementation of QR factorization for square matrix of any dimension. The reduced hardware complexity of the processors and its simple parameterized controller are two outstanding features of the architecture, resulting in a more suitable alternative architecture for QR factorization than traditional triangular systolic arrays. In the next phase of the research, new hardware architectures of the back substitution SIC decoder was developed for a 4 X 4 MIMO system with 16-QAM constellation scheme in chapter 5. The division operation for back substitution needs a complex hardware, and results in the numerical instability. In the proposed hardware the elimination of division and modification of multiplier has reduced the hardware complexity and led to numerical stability. In addition the pre decoding block was designed and optimized in terms of number of the pipeline registers and CORDIC rotator processors. The developed hardware is capable of processing 20 vectors data burst and results in a throughput of 149 Mb/s. The FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) and ASIC (Application specific Integrated Circuit) implementations of the proposed optimized architecture are presented in Chapter 5. We found that the equivalent gates and the core area in our design is less than 30% of other designs and the maximum clock frequency and the throughput is higher (175 %) than other works. Finally the improvements of the BER performance using the branching method and parallel architectures are presented in chapter 6. In this supplementary part to back substitution OSIC decoder, the final symbol vector is selected from 2 or 8 potential candidates based on the minimum Euclidean norm, which improves the BER between 3 to 7 db and gives a very close match to the original V-BLAST performance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MIMO systems</field><field name="subject">Space time codes</field><field name="subject">Antenna arrays</field><field name="subject">Signal processing - digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust Control For Gantry Cranes</field><field name="creator">Costa, Giuseppe, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis a class of robust non-linear controllers for a gantry crane system are discussed. The gantry crane has three degrees of freedom, all of which are interrelated. These are the horizontal traverse of the cart, the vertical motion of the goods (i.e. rope length) and the swing angle made by the goods during the movement of the cart. The objective is to control all three degrees of freedom. This means achieving setpoint  control for the cart and the rope length and cancellation of the swing oscillations. A mathematical model of the gantry crane system is developed using Lagrangian dynamics. In this thesis it is shown that a model of the gantry crane system can be represented as two sub models which are coupled by a term which includes the rope length as a parameter. The first system will consist of the cart and swing dynamics and the other system is the hoist dynamics. The mathematical model of these two systems will be derived independent of the other system. The model that is comprised of the two sub models is verified as an accurate model of a gantry crane system and it will be used to simulate the performance of the controllers using Matlab. For completeness a fully coupled mathematical model of the gantry crane system is also developed. A detailed design of a gain scheduled sliding mode controller is presented. This will guarantee the controller's robustness in the presence of uncertainties and bounded matched disturbances. This controller is developed to achieve cart setpoint and swing control while achieving rope length setpoint control. A non gain scheduled sliding mode controller is also developed to determine if the more complex gain scheduled sliding mode controller gives any significant improvement in performance. In the implementation of both sliding mode controllers, all system states must be available. In the real-time gantry crane system used in this thesis, the cart velocity and the swing angle velocity are not directly available from the system. They will be estimated using an alpha-beta state estimator. To overcome this limitation and provide a more practical solution an optimal output feedback model following controller is designed. It is demonstrated that by expressing the system and the model for which the system is to follow in a non-minimal state space representation, LQR techniques can be used to design the controller. This produces a dynamic controller that has a proper transfer function, and negates the need for the availability of all system states. This thesis presents an alternative method of solving the LQR problem by using a generic eigenvalue solution to solve the Riccati equation and thus determine the optimal feedback gains. In this thesis it is shown that by using a combination of sliding mode and H??? control techniques, a non-linear controller is achieved which is robust in the presence of a wide variety of uncertainties and disturbances. A supervisory controller is also described in this thesis. The supervisory control is made up of a feedforward and a feedback component. It is shown that the feedforward component is the crane operator's action, and the feedback component is a sliding mode controller which compensates as the system's output deviates from the desired trajectory because of the operator's inappropriate actions or external disturbances such as wind gusts and noise. All controllers are simulated using Matlab and implemented in real-time on a scale model of the gantry crane system using the program RTShell. The real-time results are compared against simulated results to determine the controller's performance in a real-time environment.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robust Control</field><field name="subject">Nonlinear Control</field><field name="subject">Sliding mode Control</field><field name="subject">Model Following Control</field><field name="subject">Gantry Crane Control</field><field name="subject">Non-linear Control</field><field name="subject">Gantry Cranes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Income inequality and poverty in urban China: evidence from survey data</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Na, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates income inequality and poverty in urban China using survey data from 2002. It shows that in urban China, income in the coastal region is less equally distributed than in the interior region, although social welfare is higher. Developed cities have more inequality than less developed cities, but they also have a higher level of social welfare. Further decomposition analysis indicates that intragroup inequality accounts for the dominant part of overall inequality no matter how groups are categorized - by region, by city level, by gender, or by education. There is a significant difference in the incidence of poverty between interior regions and coastal regions, with the interior region having a higher headcount ratio and a greater poverty gap ratio.

The potential medical and biological applications of such a tool are immense, and so are the challenges to accomplish it. At the level of a cell, the number of reacting molecules is so low that stochastic effects can be crucial in deciding the system-level behaviour of the cell. Despite the recent development of many new and hybrid stochastic approaches, exact stochastic simulation algorithms are still needed, and are widely employed in most current biochemical simulation packages. Unfortunately, the performance of these algorithms scales badly with the number of reactions. It is shown that this is especially the case for hubs and scale-free networks. This is worrying because hubs are an important component of biochemical systems, and it is widely suspected that biochemical networks are scale-free. It is shown that the scalability issue in these algorithms is due to the high interdependency between reactions. A general method for arbitrarily reducing this interdependency is introduced, and it is shown how it can be used for many classes of simulation processes. This is applied to one of the fastest algorithms currently, the Next Reaction Method. The resulting algorithm, the Reactant-Margin Method, is tested on a wide range of hub sizes and shown to be asymptotically faster than the current best algorithms. Hybrid versions of the Reactant-Margin Method and the Next Reaction Method are also compared on a real biological model - the Lambda-Phage virus, and the new algorithm is again shown to perform better. The problems inherent in the hybridization are also shown to be more exactly and efficiently handled in the Reactant-Margin framework than in the Next-Reaction Method framework. Finally, a software tool called GeNIV is introduced. This GUI-based biochemical modelling and simulation tool is an embodiment of a mechanistic-representation philosophy. It is implements the Reactant Margin and Next Reaction hybrid algorithms, and has a simple representation system for gene-state occupancy and their subsequent biochemical reactions. It is also novel in that it translates the graphical model into Javacode which is compiled and executed for simulation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">systems biology</field><field name="subject">stochastic simulation</field><field name="subject">biochemical reactions</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23990</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecological impacts of invasive Pinus radiata in eucalypt vegetation: pattern and process</field><field name="creator">Williams, Moira Caroline</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">propagule pressure</field><field name="subject">time-lag</field><field name="subject">litterfall</field><field name="subject">recruitment</field><field name="subject">fire</field><field name="subject">spatial variation</field><field name="subject">landscape</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/2761</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deconstructing Martin Boyd : homosocial desire and the transgressive aesthetic</field><field name="creator">Blain, Jenny</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Boyd, Martin, 1893-1972 -- Criticism and interpretation.</field><field name="subject">Male homosexuality in literature.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/2760</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ancestral Spaces: Time, Memory and the Liminal Experience of Painting</field><field name="creator">Purcell, Marisa</field><field name="description">Master of Visual Arts</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Painting</field><field name="subject">Liminal</field><field name="subject">Time</field><field name="subject">Space</field><field name="subject">Perception</field><field name="subject">Ancestral</field><field name="subject">Nonduality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/2763</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unsettling Zionism : diasporic consciousness and Australian Jewish identities</field><field name="creator">Bloch, Barbara</field><field name="description">The motivation for writing this thesis derives from the lengthy conflict between Israelis and Palestinians and its effects on Jews who have been engaged politically and intellectually in challenging a paradigm most prevalent among Australian and other diasporic Jewry since the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. The paradigm asserts that Israelis&#8217; right to live safely within secure borders must be of exclusive concern. To challenge this exclusively therefore, by speaking in support of Palestinian justice and needs for similar basic conditions of life which have not yet been met, is viewed by many Jews as disloyalty and even as antisemitism. Australian Jewry has become known as Zionism&#8217;s &#8216;last bastion&#8217;. What were the particular conditions in Australia that led to Zionism and identification with Israel becoming the key symbol of Jewish identity within the Jewish community? The Zionist project has been sustained by deeply held metaphors. These include the historically-based claims and lived experiences of victimisation and vulnerability as Jews, whether individual and collective. Through revealing and synthesising the complexities and contradictions that are inherent in Jewish-Zionist subjectivities today, the thesis hopes to illuminate more generally questions of identity formation, diaspora and community, power and victimisation, and the unifying force of discourse.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zionism</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Jews</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">Arab-Israeli conflict</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/20925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 5th discourse : the connectivity role for early childhood services : meaningful support for families</field><field name="creator">Hadley, Fay</field><field name="description">The recognised benefits of social capital have resulted in a focus on ways to provide support to families within their context or community. At the same time there has been an emphasis on the interplay between environment and experiences in the early years of life and long term physical, neurological, psychosocial and emotional/behavioural developments for humans. Coincidentally the use of out of home care for young children has expanded rapidly. These issues have resulted in a call to reconceptualise the role of early childhood services as a nexus of the community. Researchers are increasingly referring to early childhood services as hubs from which multi-sectoral supports can be developed and delivered. This thesis reviews the current literature about the importance of the early years; the experiences within the early childhood service; the renewed focus on supports for families; and the role of early childhood services as community hubs. Despite a growing body of literature about early childhood services as community hubs and as the basis for developing relationships with families, it was found that there is a dearth of information about the ways in which families and early childhood staff interface in defining what constitutes &#8216;quality&#8217; within services. Indeed it is shown that the voices of families are rarely, if ever, taken into account in the development of curriculum and assessment practices in early childhood services. Subsequently the supports that could assist staff in undertaking meaningful connections with families are not prominent in the current literature. This thesis addresses this gap in the knowledge base about early childhood service delivery. A sociocultural approach is used to investigate the level of shared perspectives, meaningful participation and other forms of meaning making between a small sample of families in diverse situations and their early childhood service. Both qualitative and quantitative methods are applied in the analyses of how early childhood services enhance or inhibit connectivity for families with preschool-aged children. In Phase One, an in-depth study of three families with diverse situations in one urban centre of Australia (An Aboriginal1 family; a culturally and linguistically diverse family; and a family wherein the father has a physical illness) is conducted. Data collection methods involve purposeful sampling, video taping, semi-structured and structured interviews and non participant observations in both the home and early childhood setting. Findings from Phase One identify six continua of issues, reported by parents to be meaningful in terms of experiences for their children. In Phase Two these findings are incorporated into a questionnaire entitled &#8220;Experiences that are valued in the early childhood service&#8221;. The questionnaire is administered to staff and families in diverse socio economic and geographical regions in order to test for generalisability of the original findings. This thesis indicates that the role of early childhood services as community and family support services is not well articulated nor well understood by staff or families. The findings from the study include: 1. Rather than supporting families, some forms of information dissemination from early childhood services actually increase pressure on families. 2. Staff and families have differing perceptions about the frequency of communication and the experiences occurring in the early childhood service. Families report that the experiences they value highly are not valued by the service. 3. Despite a strong emphasis on a multicultural approach to early childhood service delivery, not all families value this notion. Rather, families want early childhood services to &#8216;teach and reflect&#8217; the dominant cultural ways of knowing and learning because this is associated with school success. 1 The researcher uses the term Aboriginal not Indigenous throughout the thesis as this as this is the main term the family used to identify themselves. 4. Some common and widely used measures assessing quality early childhood services do not include measures associated with family and community support. This thesis concludes with a set of recommendations for service delivery and policy decision makers. These focus on the need to embrace a &#8216;fifth discourse&#8217; for early childhood services &#8211; one which defines the sector as the vehicle for providing safe &#8216;meeting places&#8217; where families and staff participate in meaningful ways that result in true support for the complex role of parenting.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">early childhood education</field><field name="subject">education, preschool</field><field name="subject">parent participation</field><field name="subject">parent-teacher relationships</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/21066</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of repeated prescribed burning and forest conversion on soil fungal communities</field><field name="creator">Bastias, Brigitte A.</field><field name="description">Fungi are key components in forest ecosystems, being involved in decomposition of plant biomass and the cycling of nutrients in forest soils. Despite their importance little is understood about the influence forest management practices, such as long-term prescribed burning and forest conversion are having on soil fungal communities. Part of the work described in this thesis investigated the effects of long-term repeated prescribed burning on the total soil fungal community, the diversity of mycelial communities of ectomycorrhizal fungi and the influence of biennial prescribed burning on the cellulolytic soil fungal community using stable isotope probing techniques. The influence of long-term repeated prescribed burning on soil fungal communities was investigated through a series of studies conducted at Peachester State Forest, Queensland, Australia. This site has been the centre of a long-term repeated prescribed burning experiment, established since 1972, consisting of plots subjected to biennial, quadrennial or no burning. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to show that long-term prescribed burning significantly altered the total fungal community structure in the top 10 cm of soil, when compared with unburned plots. Hyphal ingrowth bags, used to target ectomycorrhizal (ECM) mycelia in soil, along with DGGE analysis, indicated that profiles of the soil fungal community from 2 yr burn plots significantly differed from those of the 4 yr burn and unburned plots. Following analysis of clone assemblages from the different burn regimes, results indicated that this difference reflected an altered ECM fungal community composition. 13C stable isotope probing (SIP), following the incubation of soil with 13C labelled cellulose, and DGGE analysis was found to significantly alter the active fungal community in the upper 10cm of soil at Peachester State Forest. Fewer active fungi in the 2 yr burn plots were found to have incorporated 13C compared to the unburned plots, strongly suggesting that the activities of cellulolytic fungi were negatively affected by the 2 yr burning treatment. The thesis also incorporated work that assessed the effect of forest conversion from native eucalypt to Pinus elliottii plantation on the soil fungal community at Beerburrum State Forest, Queensland, Australia. ITS and 18S RNA and DNA were used, along with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and DGGE analysis, indicating that total and active fungal communities differed significantly between the native eucalypt forest and first rotation P. elliottii plantation. This suggested that the conversion from native eucalypt forest to P. elliotti plantation significantly altered the soil fungal community at the Beerburrum site.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ectomycorrhizal fungi</field><field name="subject">soil fungi</field><field name="subject">prescribed burning</field><field name="subject">soil microbiology</field><field name="subject">fire ecology</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/21101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Masculinities in rural Australia : gender, culture, and environment</field><field name="creator">Johnson, D.

It is suggested that in a context of diminishing economic power and political influence, the prevailing model of masculinity has disabled the capacity of many farm men to manage change proactively. It is argued that evidence of a necessary change from instrumental, to-values and feelings-based engagement with human and natural systems has been slow to appear. A range of beliefs and attitudes are identified from the research data.Alternatives to traditional models of masculinity are examined. The research has been conducted using a Social Ecology approach, in which the personal autonomy arising from a coherent integration of values and beliefs informs our approach to all human and natural systems. Some possible consequences of such a change in personal orientation are explored, in relation to agricultural practices, community viability, and the fostering of social capital, and reference is made to alternative forms of community organisation.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">men</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">sex role</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/21148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secrets that emerge : a case study of the utility and insight of art therapy for a group with sexual paraphilia disorder</field><field name="creator">Casamento, Marie J.</field><field name="description">Art Therapy is a psychotherapeutic process involving the use of art materials.

Playbuilding is a process whereby groups of students devise and act in their own plays using a variety of dramatic elements and theatrical conventions. This research explores the playbuilding learning experiences of two secondary school drama classes and the playbuilding teaching experiences of four drama teachers. The research underpins current drama and theatre education praxis that relates to learning through embodiment, symbolic creativity, and the purpose and function of metaxis in a secondary drama classroom. The study relied on qualitative research grounded theory techniques, focus groups, student workbooks, classrooms practices, closed questionnaires, face to face interviews and videotaped materials. Central to this research are the phenomena of imagining and creating that occur in secondary drama playbuilding groups learning through a group kinaesthetic paradigm. This study concludes that there is a paradigm which identifies secondary drama students as group kinaesthetic learners, and that kinaesthetic teaching and learning practices open up pedagogic spaces in playbuilding that significantly improve the effectiveness of group embodied learning in drama education</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theater</field><field name="subject">drama in education</field><field name="subject">improvisation (acting)</field><field name="subject">study and teaching (secondary)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/22408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The network nation : the relevance of this for possible educational and general public administrative structures and strategies in the 1980s and 90s</field><field name="creator">Freeman, Andrew R.</field><field name="description">In this thesis consideration is given to the inter-relationships between a number of key concepts and reports in educational and general public administration which have been produced over the last decade.

A study into the effect of each part of an elastic depth model (upon an elastic depth model (upon an elastic synthetic seismogram) resulted in a set of guidelines for obtaining a field data comparison. Excellent ties were obtained at several wells, often using little more than a partial sonic log. The noise contributions to the synthesis were interpreted using additional synthetics computed from variations upon the depth model and by exercising control over the wave types modelled. Subsequent processing of the synthetics revealed three types of persistent noise in progressively deeper parts of the subcoal image: 1) mode converted interbed multiples (generated within the coal sequence); 2) S-wave reflections and long period multiples (generated between the coal sequence and the Miocene carbonates and 3) surface related multiples.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gippsland, seismic, noise suppression, geology, subcoal</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The alignment of business and information strategies</field><field name="creator">Broadbent, Marianne</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to explore the nature and extent of the alignment of business and information strategies, and organisational factors which might be related to that alignment.

One particular example of an experiential consumption environment which has been influenced by the Disney-style approach to business is the shopping mall. These commercialized attractions offer a distant alternative, and distraction, to everyday life. The theoretical concept of Disneyization offers insight into what visitors to these manufactured experiential consumption destinations are (assumed to be) searching for - and in-turn receiving. This thesis specifically focuses on 1) the development and design of the New Zealand shopping mall by assessing the extent to which identified elements of the Disney theme parks are replicated within the country's shopping destinations 2) the degree to which experiential consumption environments are being developed within New Zealand. Based upon the review of completed fieldwork, the 'System of Objects' theory proposed by Baudrillard and image association perspectives of Eco are added to the theoretical analysis as a complimentary aside to the Disneyization concept.

The research method employed for this study is qualitative critical social science. Two Case studies are used to investigate the benefits brought to rural areas through the protection of GIs. The case studies include the GIs Jersey Royal and Welsh Lamb both from the United Kingdom a member of the European Union (the EU is in favour of extended protection of GIs for all agro-food products under the 1994 WTO/TRIPS agreement on geographical indications). Twenty-five indepth interviews were conducted for this study the duration of the interviews was approximately one hour. The study identifies predominantly indirect links between GIs and sustainable rural development, through economic and social benefits bought to rural areas by the GIs investigated - less of a connection was found to ecological elements. No considerable cost for GI protection was discovered.

The stories of everyday experience of Western Australian lesbian and gay educators present layers of gestured meanings, symbolic processes, cultural codes and contested sexuality and gender ideologies thereby reconstructing the reality of lesbian and gay educators. The research provides a range of embodied narratives and distinctive counter-narratives experienced by this group of educators in Western Australia. The study demonstrates that there are social practices in schooling that assist in the recognition and construction of their own gender identity even though the law in Western Australia at the time of writing, precluded the public promotion of lesbian and gay activities, and by association, silenced what many take to be their preferred mode of public behaviours. More importantly the study maps the extremely subtle processes involved in generating and expressing homophobia resulting in a sense of double invisibility, a constitutive silencing of personhood, which makes even the identification of rituals problematic. The very different stories reveal various interpretive strategies of belonging to the dominant homophobic culture, furthering our understanding of the contemporary identity formation issues of a hitherto invisible and silenced group of educators.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gay teachers -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Lesbian teachers -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Gender identity in education -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Heterosexism -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Homophobia -- Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design of an Autonomous Hovering Miniature Air Vehicle as a Flying Research Platform</field><field name="creator">Roberts, James Francis</field><field name="description">Master of Engineering (Research)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MAV</field><field name="subject">hovering platform</field><field name="subject">avionics</field><field name="subject">autonomous</field><field name="subject">flight</field><field name="subject">controller</field><field name="subject">helicopter</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/2773</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BODY IMAGE, BODY DISSATISFACTION, DIETING AND DISORDERED EATING AND EXERCISE BEHAVIOURS OF TRAINEE PHYSICAL EDUCATION TEACHERS: INVESTIGATION AND INTERVENTION</field><field name="creator">Yager, Karen M</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical and health education</field><field name="subject">body image or eating disorders</field><field name="subject">teacher training</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/2780</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acquiring marketing knowledge through international joint ventures</field><field name="creator">Hau, Le Nguyen</field><field name="description">The research stream on interpartner learning in international strategic alliances has evolved in recent years. Although several research problems have been addressed, there remain gaps in the literature about the facilitators and outcomes of knowledge acquisition in international joint ventures. To bridge these gaps, this research has two main objectives. Firstly, it identifies various antecedents and tests their effects on the acquisition of marketing know-how by the local partner from the foreign partner. Secondly, it investigates how the acquired marketing know-how impacts on the learning outcomes in an IJV.The findings of this study show the effects of eight antecedents on the acquisition of tacit and explicit forms of marketing know-how. Research gaps have been bridged by this study in several ways. The thesis has also answered the call for empirical studies to provide statistical evidence with respect to inter-organizational learning in the international arena. It contributes new measurement scales as well as suggests effective ways of acquiring marketing knowledge from foreign partners in IJV.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international joint ventures</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">marketing research</field><field name="subject">strategic alliances</field><field name="subject">developing countries</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/22517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analytical and numerical development on vibration of shells</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Lei</field><field name="description">The subject of free vibration analysis of thin cylindrical shells is one that extends well back into the last century.

The state-space technique is adopted to derive the homogenous differential equations for a shell segment and the domain decomposition method is employed to impose the equilibrium and compatability requirements along the interfaces of the shell segments. Extensive analytical and numerical results have been obtained in this thesis for vibration of open/closed cylindrical shells with different boundary conditions, step-wise thickness variations, and multiple intermediate ring supports.

Computer database, spreadsheet and statistical packages were utilised in the analysis of seven hundred and fifty residential land sales from two areas of Western Sydney. The prime objective of the research was to provide valuers with a personal computer based system that could be applied to direct comparison valuation. Two main approaches were taken in the analysis of sales and prediction of values. The first comprised stepwise multiple regression analysis. The second comprised the adjustment grid (or matrix) approach (which is based on paired sales techniques assisted by spreadsheet technology). The study has been limited to the analysis and prediction of values for residential land. Valuers who carry out mass appraisals may also be required to value industrial, commercial, and retail lands. Therefore, there is a need for further research relating to the applicability of the computerised techniques discussed in this thesis.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">property valuation</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/22664</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of the joint probability approach to ungauged catchments for design flood estimation</field><field name="creator">Mazumder, Tanvir</field><field name="description">Design flood estimation is often required in hydrologic practice. For catchments with sufficient streamflow data, design floods can be obtained using flood frequency analysis. For catchments with no or little streamflow data (ungauged catchments), design flood estimation is a difficult task. The currently recommended method in Australia for design flood estimation in ungauged catchments is known as the Probabilistic Rational Method. There are alternatives to this method such as Quantile Regression Technique or Index Flood Method. All these methods give the flood peak estimate but the full streamflow hydrograph is required for many applications. The currently recommended rainfall based flood estimation method in Australia that can estimate full streamflow hydrograph is known as the Design Event Approach. This considers the probabilistic nature of rainfall depth but ignores the probabilistic behavior of other flood producing variables such as rainfall temporal pattern and initial loss, and thus this is likely to produce probability bias in final flood estimates. Joint Probability Approach is a superior method of design flood estimation which considers the probabilistic nature of the input variables (such as rainfall temporal pattern and initial loss) in the rainfall-runoff modelling. Rahman et al. (2002) developed a simple Monte Carlo Simulation technique based on the principles of joint probability, which is applicable to gauged catchments. This thesis extends the Monte Carlo Simulation technique to ungauged catchments. The Joint Probability Approach/ Monte Carlo Simulation Technique requires identification of the distributions of the input variables to the rainfall-runoff model e.g. rainfall duration, rainfall intensity, rainfall temporal pattern, and initial loss. For gauged catchments, these probability distributions are identified from observed rainfall and/or streamflow data. For application of the Joint Probability Approach to ungauged catchments, the distributions of the input variables need to be regionalised. This thesis, in particular, investigates the regionalisation of the distribution of rainfall duration and intensity. In this thesis, it is hypothesised that the distribution of storm duration can be described by Exponential distribution. The developed new technique of design flood estimation can provide the full hydrograph rather than only peak value as with the Probabilistic Rational Method and Quantile Regression Technique. The developed new technique can further be improved by addition of new and improved regional estimation equations for the initial loss, continuing loss and storage delay parameter (k) as and when these are available.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flood forecasting</field><field name="subject">flood control</field><field name="subject">rainfall probabilities</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/22731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the chemistry and origins of terpenes from Australian Myrtaceae</field><field name="creator">Cornwell, Charles Peter</field><field name="description">A survey to determine the origins of many of the mono- and sesquiterpenoids derived from over 800 species from the Eucalyptus, Leptospermum and Chamelaucium alliances of the family Myrtaceae subfamily Leptospermoideae was undertaken using specially developed small-scale extraction and steam-ditillation techniques (using normal and O-labelled water) coupled with enantioselective gas chromatography. This information was used to indirectly identify potential biosynthetic pathways and accessed how extraction conditions, such as those encountered during a distillation, can alter the oil profiles obtained. Terpenes present in the oils of the Myrtaceae showed a wide range of acid-catalysed solvolysis reactions during distillation and leaf aging thereby altering the biosynthetic history laid down by the plant. Such changes can occur both during leaf aging and distillation. Similarly acid-sensitive sesquiterpenes also undergo acid-solvolysis during leaf aging or distillation. This work identifies the biosynthetic and degradative origins of many of the compounds present in the oils extracted from the Myrtaceae and has found that the composition of an oil, regardless of extractive conditions, should not be considered a true representation of the biosynthetic history of the plant.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">terpenes</field><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="subject">myrtaceae</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/22799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the restitution narrative</field><field name="creator">Alder, Suzanne Alvilda</field><field name="description">The term &#8216;restitution narrative&#8217; describes the hope we all have when illness or accidental impairment befalls us to be returned to a pre-morbid condition of health as soon as possible, and in modern Western society we expect the miracle of restitutions to be mediated by medical science. Medicine is still unable to cure a wide range of illness and disability. For these people the restitution narrative fails. This study attempts to create space between health and illness, the space of the failed patient, within which to explore the iatrogenic and disabling effects on bodies and minds living in a society that has come to expect not to suffer when illness or disability is incurable and chronic. Through the medium of a purpose built website, people who are chronically ill and disabled discussed the &#8216;wicked issues&#8217; that make lives already challenged unnecessarily difficult. Application of the findings of research in psychobiology is applied to speculate whether health may be worsened by being a failed patient in a culture for which health has become the ultimate good.

The study draws on some of the issues raised by Filipinas arising from a series of in-depth interviews. These issues include the lack of knowledge of the Australian culture and the need to change customary ways in order to adapt.

In addition to extensive interviews with government officials, a sample of 2,000 retires and their children were surveyed in Shanghai as part of my research. My findings from the Research Survey and Questionnaire, together with my observations from site visits to numerous aged care crisis and the associated problems. Of primary concern is the fact that the Chinese government does not have in place an appropriate aged care structure nor a strategy to implement systems to cope with the impending crisis. I conclude that it is imperative the Chinese government recognises both the immediacy and scale of the crisis and acts accordingly. Failure to do so may result in both significant social unrest and severe economic consequences.

The cental argument running through all five studies is that investment in China is complex but comprehensive. Although China shows unique features, the general problems of planning and executing investment are similar to those found in any case of a firm moving across international boundaries. The individual studies complement each other, moving from the way in which Chinese government policy frames the operating environment, to the modes of analysis required of firms considering investing in China, to the more specific issues encountered by foreign firms in China, to the special problems facing Hong Kong, and finally a more abstract re-formulation of the issues of foreign investment in the Chinese context. These general arguments are well substantiated in these studies, and they serve as a useful counter to the more simplistic and enthusiastic treatments on the one hand, and the excessively pessimistic evaluations on the other. Naturally, the world did not stop just after China entered into the WTO. As it moves forward, new competitive elements have emerged and as more variables develop in response to the evolving environment the writer will be shifting his attention to the post-WTO phase of China's economic development- a challenge which could be as interesting and intriguing to pundits, entrepreneurs, governments and indeed to all players involved.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international business enterprises</field><field name="subject">investments, foreign</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">economic conditions</field><field name="subject">economic policy</field><field name="subject">foreign economic relations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/23148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and evaluation of a system for the study of mineral nutrition of sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera)</field><field name="creator">Hicks, David James</field><field name="description">The sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) is a large aquatic plant endemic to subtropical and tropical Asia and northern Australia. Lotus has a combination of morphological and anatomical features that make it challenging for research work. The necessity of research on lotus is driven by niche market opportunities identified in Japan during counter seasonal production periods. Several features of lotus are utilised for consumer applications with commercial promise including seeds, young shoots and rhizome production. Further, the flowers and seed pods have value as cut-flower products and religious decoration. Several challenges have to be overcome before production of adequate products can be realised in Australia. The challenges which can be addressed most immediately are the questions regarding plant nutrition for lotus. In order to accomplish certain objectives, development of a system for growth and analysis of imposed nutrient treatments in replication, which accommodated a plant with unusual and seasonal attributes, was essential. The results of the tests conducted on the trialled system, whilst not conclusive, provide a solid reference for any future research on lotus nutrition.

Spores of group II non-proteolytic Clostridium botulinum can survive the mild heat treatment typically given to these products and can grow at refrigeration temperatures. To circumvent this safety issue, existing preservation methods can either affect the sensory properties of these foods or damage their image. Therefore, additional natural preservation hurdles are needed. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop a novel bio-preservation method based on the principle of antibiosis between protective cultures (PCs) and C. botulinum. Consequently, the objectives were to select effective anti-botulinal cultures and study their inhibition pattern in microbiological media and foods, identify the conditions for effective inhibition and the nature of the antibiosis. This research demonstrates for the first time that the bacteriocinogenic protective cultures inoculated at high levels had an anti-botulinal effect in a range of commercial cook-chill products, which supported active growth of non-proteolytic C. botulinum.

The inherent electroactive properties of the polypyrrole-urease film has enabled the production of a flow injection amperometric biosensor for the reliable determination of urea. Greater sensitivity and stability was achieved when a pulsed amperometric detection system was implemented. The analysis of urea in human blood plasma by potentiometry, amperometry and pulsed amperometry was achieved with the assistance of an anion exchange separation prior to the electrochemical detection of urea. A polypyrrole-sulfite oxidase film was developed for use in an amperometric biosensor for sulfite determination. The response of the biosensor to sulfate was linear from 0 to 80 mg/L and the minimum detectable amount was 5 mg/L. Useful interferants in sulfite determination such as ascorbic acid, sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate did not respond to the biosensor. The excellent reproducibility of the sulfite response provides the basis for the construction of a disposable or renewable biosensor for sulfite determination.

The text encompasses much of the difficulties and provides a frame work for achieving positive results. The hardware requirements and the concepts for successful completion of heart-cutting and comprehensive modes of separation are addressed. Low molecular weight polystyrenes play an essential role in providing a model framework or theme for the development of two-dimensional liquid chromatographic systems. Low-molecular weight oligostyrenes were initially used to provide a theoretical assessment of combinations of liquid chromatographic systems. Interpretation of theoretical results then allowed for the development of a heart-cutting two-dimensional liquid chromatographic system for the separation of oligostyrene complex samples. This allowed for practice to be compared with the theoretical results, which are presented and provided direction as to what attributes of a two-dimensional liquid chromatographic system are beneficial. Petroleum oils are one of the most complex mixtures found in the natural environment and are included to provide a real-world application that demonstrates the potential power of comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatographic systems. Orthogonality is a central theme throughout the whole thesis. Separation correlation is shown to be advantageous in certain instances in the evaluation of hybrid stationary phases, as shown in the analysis of a low molecular weight polystyrene sample. The thesis finishes by the incorporation of monolithic separation media as an alternative second dimension stationary phase support. A method is discussed that allows for a substantial increase in the volume and concentration loading of two-dimensional liquid chromatographic systems that employ monolithic chromatography columns in the second dimension. This is important since volume overloading and concentration overloading in the second dimension can reduce separation performance and hence the final chapter provides a new direction for research.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">liquid chromatography</field><field name="subject">chromatographic analysis</field><field name="subject">oligostyrenes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/23423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discipline and learn : theorising the pedagogic body</field><field name="creator">Watkins, Megan</field><field name="description">This thesis, grounded in an empirically-based study of pedagogic practice in primary school classrooms, examines the corporeality of learning and its role in the process of learning how to write. The central concern in the formation of scholarly habits in the primary years and the degree to which the embodiment of specific dispositions is fundamental in students acquiring the ability and desire to write. This thesis explores the enabling dimensions of embodiment and how these can be generated through the pedagogic practices of schooling. The body is not simply perceived as being shaped by the external, nor capacitated by its ability to retain affects, but rather as mindful, where these affects form the basis of consciousness with embodied understanding being integral to how we learn. This thesis asserts the inseparability of body and mind. Different conceptualisations of the body are examined, and assessed in terms of their usefulness in understanding the role of the body in learning and the need within education to posit an ontology that embraces both the body and the mind. A genealogy of the educative body is provided through an analysis of English syllabus documents within the New South Wales education system.

This thesis considers the problems posed by e-Marketplace development and the design of intelligent trading agents for supply chain management in e-Marketplaces. The primary contribution of this thesis is its detailed analysis of the characteristics and properties of a typical e-Marketplace environment, its exploration of optimal trading agent strategies and its discussions of possible enhancements for the state-of-the-art e-Marketplace development and trading agent design. This research is stimulated by the recently introduced Trading Agent Competition for Supply Chain Management (TAC SCM) game scenario, which is a representation of typical e-Marketplaces. TAC SCM is the only competition-based e-Marketplace simulation system that captures the real challenges present in an integrated procurement, production and customer-bidding environment. The game was designed jointly by a team made up of researchers from the e-Supply Chain Management Lab at Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Minnesota, and the Swedish Institute of Computer Science (SICS), with tremendous inputs from the research community. This thesis starts with a detailed analysis of TAC SCM e-Marketplaces. We present an abstract model of the game, which consists of the market demand and market supply models. A series of experimental results that indicate the correctness and effectiveness of the strategies will then be presented, followed by the presentation of a new negotiation mechanism for the TAC SCM component market and the presentation of a new supplier model to demonstrate how negotiation strategies can be applied in automated negotiation. We explore the areas where the current TAC SCM scenario can be improved, followed by an outline of proposed enhancements to the TAC SCM e-Marketplace mechanism.

This makes it difficult to test between the theories. Nevertheless, the task of doing so is important since the social return to education is likely to be small unless education adds to productivity as human capital theory, but not screening theory, assumes. Education may only convey information about likely individual productivity under screening. It serves this function because individual productivity is difficult for employers to observe. In fact, there is very little evidence from existing tests of the theories that education does not add to productivity. However, few of the tests that have been undertaken between the theories are convincing. The three empirical chapters of this thesis contain tests of some aspects of the theories.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human capital, screening, education, labour market</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magnificence, misery and madness: a history of the Kew Asylum 1872-1915</field><field name="creator">Day, Cheryl</field><field name="description">The Kew Asylum has been a dominant feature of Melbourne&#8217;s built environment for over 100 years. In addition to the visual impact it has made on Melbourne&#8217;s skyline it has been very much a part of the psychological landscape of the collective imagination of the city&#8217;s inhabitants. Despite this, comparatively little has been written about its impact on society, and almost nothing has been recorded in any comprehensive sense, about its occupants or inmates. This dissertation aims to go some way towards redressing this, not with a broad sweep institutional biography, but with an intimate portrait of the asylum&#8217;s earliest days. Covering a time frame of less than 50 years, this thesis adopts a multi-theoretical approach in order to illuminate the different facets of asylum life with the maximum clarity. The thesis contains several themes, some of which overlap and interweave in order to examine the complexity of institutional life.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kew, Melbourne, asylum, institution, mental illness</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Swirling flow of viscoelastic fluids</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Jason R.</field><field name="description">The ability to understand and predict the flow behaviour of non-Newtonian fluids in swirling flow is industrially important for the efficient design and performance of processes which utilise fluids with complex rheological properties. In particular, fluids with elastic properties are not well described by non-Newtonian constitutive models, such that predictions using such models must be carefully validated. A benchmark problem is proposed here which provides a well defined geometry to study the swirling flow of non-Newtonian fluids as a test case for the validation of constitutive models. The confined swirling flow utilised is a torsionally driven cavity where the test fluid is confined in a cylinder with a rotating bottom lid, and stationary side walls and top lid. The flow field is three-dimensional and consists of both a primary motion, which is directed azimuthally, and a secondary motion, which is located in the radial and axial plane of the cylinder and driven by inertial and/or elastic forces.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">swirling, flow, viscoelastic, fluid, viscous, inertia, forces, Boger</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mineralogy, geochemistry and origin of the Kalgoorlie gold deposits, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Golding, Lee Yvonne</field><field name="description">Rich gold-telluride lodes (steeply dipping and flatly dipping) and minor gold-quartz stockwork mineralization characterize the Kalgoorlie gold-field.

The in-flight agglomerate size of solid charge with different characteristics has been measured using turbulent conditions similar to a full-scale flash furnace. Plant observations indicated that under certain conditions solid charge was able to pass through the furnace shaft unreacted. The motivation for this work was to improve the understanding and the modelling of a flash furnace. A review of the literature revealed that the disintegration of agglomerates of solid charge is very important to the performance of a flash furnace, however, there has been no detailed study of the factors governing the disintegration of in-flight agglomerates of solid charge.A laboratory-scale experimental rig was constructed to non-intrusively measure the in-flight agglomerate size distribution of solid charge and to visualise the powder injection process, while using turbulent conditions similar to a flash furnace. A high-speed video technique and a laser diffraction technique were used to measure the wide range of in-flight agglomerate sizes present during powder injection. A range of variables including the particle size, turbulence level, packing density, particle shape, solid concentration, and moisture content were investigated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agglomeration, flash smelting, nickel, concentrate, powder, dispersion</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Water Deficit on Pollen Development in Rice</field><field name="creator">NGUYEN, Ngoc Giao</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rice</field><field name="subject">anthers</field><field name="subject">pollen</field><field name="subject">water stress</field><field name="subject">reactive oxygen species</field><field name="subject">programmed cell death</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/2804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Obstacle Location and Frequency on the Propagation of Premixed Flames</field><field name="creator">Hall, Ross Douglas</field><field name="description">Master of Engineering</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Premixed Combustion</field><field name="subject">Laser Diagnostics</field><field name="subject">Turbulence</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/2795</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chloride abstraction from ruthenium alkyl bis-diphosphine dichlorides</field><field name="creator">Tronoff, Ashley</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philisophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chemistry</field><field name="subject">dinitrogen</field><field name="subject">ruthenium</field><field name="subject">alkylphosphine</field><field name="subject">chloride abstraction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/2801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathophysiology of Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial Cells</field><field name="creator">Cheluvappa, Rajkumar</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liver</field><field name="subject">Pimonidazole</field><field name="subject">Hypoxia</field><field name="subject">Vascular endothelial growth factor</field><field name="subject">Vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor 2</field><field name="subject">Aging</field><field name="subject">Poloxamer 407</field><field name="subject">hepatocyte</field><field name="subject">immunohistochemistry</field><field name="subject">electron microscopy</field><field name="subject">liver sinusoidal endothelial cell</field><field name="subject">fenestrations</field><field name="subject">oxidative stress</field><field name="subject">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">pyocyanin</field><field name="subject">transplantation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/2802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The elucidation of retention behaviour of molecular interactions on bonded phases in reversed phase liquid chromatography</field><field name="creator">Kayillo, Sindy</field><field name="description">Separations depend on the molecular interactions occurring on retentive surfaces.

When deinstitutionalisation occurs it impacts not only on the person with a disability but on their significant others and also on the organisation/s providing them with support. While government departments and support organisations say that they involve family members in deinstitutionalisation, little previous research has focussed on family members&#8217; experiences of deinstitutionalisation to know if it is an engaging and empowering experience for them. Most previous studies of deinstitutionalisation, where they have spoken to significant others, have focussed on their perceptions of the benefits or disadvantages of deinstitutionalisation for their son or daughter with a disability directly rather than considering how it impacted upon the significant others. I identified this as a gap in our current knowledge and set out through this study to find out what deinstitutionalisation was like from the viewpoint of some significant others involved in it My research methodology was informed by a Symbolic Interactionist approach whereby I wished to investigate the meaning attached by significant others to the process and the outcomes of deinstitutionalisation through in depth interviews The application of selective coding procedures led to the development of the core category - for some significant others devolution is a disempowering process. This is a different viewpoint to that expressed in the majority of studies of devolution. In considering why this study revealed a different story, I identified through the data and from reviewing the available international literature, that deinstitutionalisation rekindles feelings of guilt regarding the decision to place their child in an out-of-home placement. Application of these principles might result in Empowering Partnerships which would in turn benefit all three players. I translated the three major categories and five principles into a Model of Empowering Partnerships in Devolution.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">developmentally disabled</field><field name="subject">deinstitutionalization</field><field name="subject">developmentally disabled children</field><field name="subject">family relationships.</field><field name="subject">family social work</field><field name="subject">group homes for the developmentally disabled</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/24091</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enumeration and survival studies of free and encapsulated Lactobacillus Acidophilus and Bifidobacterium Lactis in Cheddar cheese</field><field name="creator">Darukaradhya, Jyothsna</field><field name="description">The regulatory standards set by food authorities globally for probiotic foods such as Cheddar cheese makes it essential to have reliable enumeration media that will accurately monitor the survival of probiotic bacteria over the shelf life of Cheddar cheese. This study therefore investigated various selective and differential media for reliable enumeration of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium spp., starter lactic acid bacteria (SLAB) and non-starter lactic acid bacteria (NSALB) from Cheddar cheese using pure cultures and commercial probiotic Cheddar cheese. All media showed variation in counts and selectivity. Some reported selective media failed to inhibit SLAB and NSLAB. The media that were reliable and also gave good recovery were, Reinforced Clostridium Agar with Bromocresol green and Clindamycin (RCABC), which was selective for L. acidophilus spp. and Reinforced Clostridium Agar with Aniline blue and Dicloxacillin (RCAAD), which was differential for Bifidobacterium spp. and SLAB. Reinforced Clostridium Agar with Bromocresol green and Vancomycin (RCABV) was found suitable for NSLAB. Additionally, an enzyme based colorimetric assay was modified successfully and used as a confirmatory test to check the presence of bifidobacterial colonies on enumeration media. Six batches of probiotic Cheddar cheese were manufactured with the incorporation of LAFTI L10 (L. acidophilus) and LAFTI B94 (B. lactis). The survival of probiotic bacteria, SLAB and NSLAB were monitored over a six-month ripening period using the selected media. The survival of free probiotic bacteria throughout the ripening process decreased consistently in all the six batches. In order to enhance the survival of probiotic bacteria, the effect of microencapsulation on the viability of LAFTI L10 and LAFTI B94 in Cheddar cheese was studied. Six batches of Cheddar cheese were manufactured with the incorporation of alginate-starch encapsulated and free cells of LAFTI L10 and LAFTI B94. The survival of both the encapsulated and free probiotic bacteria was studied over a six month ripening period. The survival of encapsulated LAFTI L10 and LAFTI B94 (107 cfu/g) was found to be significantly better than that of free bacteria (105 cfu/g) at the end of six months of ripening period in Cheddar cheese.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lactobacillus acidophilus</field><field name="subject">Bifidobacterium lactis</field><field name="subject">bacteria</field><field name="subject">cheese</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/24126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental regionalisation for the identification of potential legume production areas on Lombok Island using a geographic information system</field><field name="creator">Wangiyana, Wayan</field><field name="description">In Lombok Island (Indonesia), the ratio of land area to population is already low, and is likely to decrease because of the increasing size of the human population. The management of land resources is, therefore, important, to ensure the wise and sustainable use of the available land in meeting population demands, especially for food. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have been used successfully in resource management, and this area of their application has been a major driver in the development of GIS. Because agrosystems need to be tuned to the specific characteristics of regional environments, regionalisation is one way to improve agricultural production and the management of agrotechnology development. The identification of potential areas for growing soybean, peanut and common bean was conducted based on two tools: GIS analysis and the 30 group regionalisation. Both techniques have advantages and disadvantages. Using GIS, exact mapping of the potential category of each grid cell can be done, but it cannot be used to estimate the total humid periods and suitable planting times in a year. Using a regionalisation, these can be done, but only when purposes is suggested as more widely applicable than using GIS analysis. Both techniques have a role to play. Based on an initial validation of the techniques employed and the results obtained, further work is suggested, either for the optimum application of the results presently obtained or for the improvement of the techniques of analysis and thence the production of results for future use.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">legumes</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Lombok (Island)</field><field name="subject">geographic information systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/24186</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experiential training and risk management behaviour amongst pilots</field><field name="creator">Molesworth, Brett R. C.</field><field name="description">General aviation pilots continue to be over represented in aircraft accidents in comparison to their commercial counterparts. Of those general aviation aircraft accidents that occur, a large proportion has been attributed to poor aeronautical decision-making. Previous research suggests that a leading factor that precipitates poor decision-making is an unrealistic assessment of the risks. Contemporary aviation training programmes do not necessarily target risk management as a distinct skill. Rather, it is assumed that risk management skills are acquired through pilots&#8217; interaction with the environment and through the acquisition of factual information relating to the statistical frequency of accidents and/or incidents. The primary aim of this thesis was to examine the utility of various training strategies to improve pilots&#8217; risk management behaviour. Throughout this thesis, it was assumed that pilots&#8217; risk management behaviour would be reflected in their performance during a variety of low-flying activities. Three experiments were conducted, the first of which examined the utility of three different training approaches, where pilots were either cognitively active (i.e., flying a simulated flight and receiving feedback in relation to performance) or cognitively inactive (i.e., reading a newsletter or watching a video) during training. The second experiment examined the impact of cognitive involvement and feedback on individual&#8217;s risk management behaviour, while the third examined the extent to which information acquired during a low-flying training flight would generalise to other tasks which differed in terms of cognitive load. The results provided support for a training programme that engaged the pilots cognitively during training. However, the extent to which the information acquired during training will generalise to other tasks appears to be contingent on a number of factors (i.e., memory, experience, and cognitive involvement). The results of this study are discussed in terms of both a theoretical and an applied perspective.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">air pilots</field><field name="subject">training of</field><field name="subject">aeronautics</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">experiential learning</field><field name="subject">human services personnel</field><field name="subject">in-service training</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/24284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploratory study of the effect of market orientation on perceived ownership, location and internalization advantages and level of foreign direct investments by small and medium enterprises</field><field name="creator">Frimpong , Anokye</field><field name="description">Organizational learning and innovation capabilities are widely regarded as important sources of competitive advantage as they enhance a firm&#8217;s capacity to create, maintain, expand and renew its bases of strategic resources, and, as a result, increase its chances of success in the marketplace. Despite this recognition, the rational choice assumption implicit in Dunning&#8217;s (1980) ownership, location and internalization (OLI) advantages model of foreign direct investment (FDI) has led researchers to assume away firm-level differences in knowledge management capability (KMC) such as market orientation that influence how small and medium enterprise (SME) acquires knowledge and use the insights gained to assess and respond to both host market opportunities and uncertainties. This study addresses this theoretical gap in FDI research by exploring three related issues. 1/. How does a SME&#8217;s market orientation influence its competitiveness in a foreign market? 2/. What is the effect of a SME&#8217;s knowledge related competitive advantages on the level of FDI it chooses to have in its operations in its most important foreign market? 3/. How does a SMIE&#8217;s investment readiness [a proxy for financial capital adequacy] moderate the link between a SME&#8217;s perceived competitiveness and its level of FDI in a foreign market? Overall the study shows that adopting an organizational capability perspective that focuses on an individual SME&#8217;s capabilities and incorporating strategic considerations in FDI analysis complements the industry-based OLI model that appears better suited for explaining broad patterns of FDI flows at the industry level.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">business enterprises</field><field name="subject">finance</field><field name="subject">business enterprises, foreign</field><field name="subject">investments, foreign</field><field name="subject">industrial management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/24336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring and designing practical techniques for the analysis and design of complex work systems : a journeyman's story</field><field name="creator">Bruce-Smith, David A.</field><field name="description">Formal systems thinking methods are not readily understandable, applicable nor necessarily useful in the dealing with complex problem domains facing managers in the public sector workplace.

This concept first arose on the policy agenda of the World Health Organisation in the 1970s and then re-emerged in 2002 (with alternative and complementary medicines). The history of this policy at the global level and its transfer to national levels over this period is analysed, via the content, scope and outcomes of policy and programme documents. This analysis emphasises the roles of context and stakeholders (specifically interest groups). The context in terms of the economic, political and social environment surrounding the development of the policy is considered, and held to offer a potential explanation as to how and why the policy agenda on integration was set and the manner in which programmes were formulated and implemented. Interest group interaction (competition for resources) is concluded to play a key role in explaining the development of this policy on an international level, and its problematic transfer to national levels. A case study of Sri Lanka explores national level implementation in greater detail. An analytical framework to analyse the development and implementation of this policy has been created, from a synthesis of anthropological and political science tools. The combination of several theories into an analytical framework allows this policy issue to be understood as an intrinsically political exercise that has been stimulated by global social and economic forces. The analytical framework developed offers another tool for the analysis and consequent understanding of the health policy process and thus may have relevance beyond the health policy issue of integration.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical care</field><field name="subject">medical policy</field><field name="subject">traditional medicine</field><field name="subject">Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">World Health Organization</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/25358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Individual autonomy as a basis of criminal complicity in New South Wales and Jordan : a comparative study</field><field name="creator">Al Qudah, Mouaid</field><field name="description">This dissertation is a comparative study of the law of criminal complicity in Jordan (a civil law jurisdiction), and in New South Wales (NSW) (a common law jurisdiction).

Ideas of such autonomy have been integral to western ethical, political and legal thinking since the seventeenth century. The analysis in this dissertation raises issues where the criminal law does not adequately take into account the limits on individual autonomy in relation to liberty of action, freedom of choice and effective deliberation. These issues highlight that a more serious and deeper understanding of individual autonomy as a ground of culpability must be taken into account by law-makers, to ensure that the grounds of criminal culpability more adequately reflect the limits on people&#8217;s individual autonomy in modern society today.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">law and ethics</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">procedure (law)</field><field name="subject">persons (law)</field><field name="subject">Jordan</field><field name="subject">law and legislation</field><field name="subject">sociological jurisprudence</field><field name="subject">autonomy (psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/25453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inhabiting space and place : from installation to the clinical setting</field><field name="creator">Fowler Smith, Juliet</field><field name="description">This paper explores the relationship between place in installation art and its relevance to the practice of placemaking in a hospital setting.

Specifically, it examines the acoustic and aesthetic theories that inform the practice of American composers La Monte Young and Alvin Lucier. One particular theme - the sine wave - emerges, both as a prominent feature in the work of these two composers, and also as a nexus point between music and acoustics. Pursuing this theme, the thesis begins by looking at issues in the science, technology, and ideology of acoustics in relation to the study of musical sound in the late nineteenth century. It then aims to situate the sine wave historically, culturally and technologically within a range of scientific and aesthetic practices in operation in the first half of the twentieth century. Finally, it explores the deployment of concepts from the field of acoustics by artists of the avant-garde, and considers what contribution these factors played in broadening the developing discourse of sound within the arts. These discussions then inform detailed investigations into the work of both Lucier and Young, examining their use of sine waves to explore and produce simple acoustic phenomena.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">acoustics and physics</field><field name="subject">music and science</field><field name="subject">avant-garde (music)</field><field name="subject">Young, La Monte</field><field name="subject">Lucier, Alvin</field><field name="subject">criticism and interpretation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/25659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Educational reform and the emergence of modern libraries in China with special reference to the Metropolitan Library of Beijing, 1909-1937</field><field name="creator">Tang, Jinhong</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the rise of modern Chinese libraries between the1840s and the 1930s in the context of educational reform, intellectual development, national regeneration and state building. It focuses on how educational reform and other factors influenced the way in which modern libraries came into being in China. It argues that the establishment of modern libraries in China was a complicated and long process, as China followed neither the &#8220;industrialisation and democracy&#8221; model of the United States nor the &#8220;modernisation&#8221; model of Meiji Japan. Modern libraries were introduced into China in the closing years of the Qing Dynasty (1644&#8211;1911) to facilitate educational reform and national regeneration. The Nationalist government, established in 1928, further stimulated the expansion of Chinese libraries as part of the government&#8217;s state building efforts. This thesis examines the Chinese case in the emergence of modern libraries: the case of &#8220;underdevelopment&#8221; with distinctive Chinese characteristics. To explore the factors that contributed to the underdevelopment of modern Chinese libraries as they emerged, this thesis employs a case study of the Metropolitan Library of Beijing&#8212;the predecessor of the National Library of China&#8212;between 1909 and 1937 in terms of its formation, early development, and problems. This analysis reveals that both the macro and micro factors conducive to library development were not present in China before the 1920s. Even when the conditions improved during the 1920s and the 1930s, especially during the Nanjing Decade, the development of modern Chinese libraries was far from satisfactory for various reasons, with low library consciousness being an important one. The Conclusion of this thesis outlines the continuing impediment of low library consciousness in China today.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational change</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">libraries</field><field name="subject">libraries and education</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">Beijing tu shu guan</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/23658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of harvest timing and irrigation on the quality of olive oil</field><field name="creator">Ayton, Jamie G.</field><field name="description">Olive oil production in Australia has increased significantly in the past decade, and will soon reach about forty thousand tonnes per annum. While some Mediterranean countries have well established, modern olive oil industries, the Australian industry is still in its infancy. In order to compete in the world market, the Australian olive oil industry requires information on the response of olive cultivars in Australian conditions, especially when to harvest and irrigate to produce high quality olive oil. This study investigated the effect of harvest timing and irrigation on the quality of olive oil. It was conducted on a commercial olive grove in southern New South Wales over a three year period. It involved harvesting, extraction and analysis of the oil at 6 harvest times from early February to late July. A number of irrigation regimes were imposed in this study, although management was difficult due to drought conditions and lack of available water. The study provides very useful information and guidelines not only for the Australian olive industry, but also for the international olive oil producing community.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">olive industry and trade</field><field name="subject">olive oil industry</field><field name="subject">olive</field><field name="subject">harvesting</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/23714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effectiveness of foreign aid : a case study of Nepal</field><field name="creator">Bhattarai , Badri Prasad</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the effectiveness of foreign aid in Nepal, and adds to the growing literature on the issue of aid effectiveness. Until the mid 1960s, almost all development projects in Nepal were financed by foreign aid. Since 1970, the average aid/GDP ratio remains at over 6 per cent, and in 2002 foreign aid financed over 50 per cent of Nepal&#8217;s development expenditure. Despite the constant flow of foreign aid and decades of aid-financed development efforts in Nepal, it remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with per capita income of about US$ 243 and almost 40 per cent of the total population living in absolute poverty. This thesis is the first rigorous study of aid effectiveness in Nepal. It examines the issue from three complementary perspectives. First, it looks at aid&#8217;s contribution to per capita GDP within the framework of the neoclassical production function. Second, it examines aid&#8217;s contribution to Nepal&#8217;s gross domestic investment within a framework of the two-gap model. Since aid is channelled through the government, the thesis lastly examines the impact of foreign aid on government expenditure and revenue efforts. Our study uses time-series data for the period 1970-2002, and employs cointegration and the error correction mechanism as the estimation procedure. The results show that aid has a positive and significant relationship between per capita real GDP, savings and investment in the long-run. In addition, we find that aid effectiveness improves in a good policy environment, that is, one characterised by a stable macroeconomy, openness to trade and a liberalised financial sector. The study also finds that bilateral and multilateral aid are equally effective in the long-run. However, grants aid has a stronger positive association with per capita real GDP in the long-run than loans aid. Finally, the relationship between aid and per capita real GDP in the short-run is found to be negative in both aggregate and disaggregated forms. This implies that Nepal, as in the case of most other developing countries, suffers from lack of absorptive capacity and high aid volatility.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nepal</field><field name="subject">economic assistance</field><field name="subject">economic development</field><field name="subject">economic conditions</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/23734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of a specially-devised, integrated curriculum, based on the music of Sting, on the learning of popular music</field><field name="creator">Winter, Neal</field><field name="description">In order to evaluate the effects of an integrated curriculum on the learning of popular music, the Sting Curriculum was designed for senior secondary students of mixed ability.

The study provides empirical evidence that question-answering instruction can lead to statistically significant comparisons in reading comprehension performance that favoured intervention participants compared to students completing regular classroom reading instruction. The current study involved a quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest design that targeted 267 students enrolled in 10 regular Year 5 classes across three schools. Classroon teachers implemented the intervention over 10 weeks. The application of information processing models in extant research of effective instruction in literacy and numeracy has been documented. The current intervention is the first application of this theoretical framework to a complex skill in reading comprehension, namely question-answering.

By empathising with, nurturing and sustaining the whole person, and taking account of past patterning as well as future visions including technological advances to augment human awareness, the scene is set for depth learning. Depth learning in a tertiary environment can only happen as a result of the dynamic that exists between the dominant, logical/rational, intellectual paradigm and the experiential extension of the boundaries surrounding this domain. Any experiences which suppress the full, holistic expression of our being alienate us from the fullness of the expression and hence from depth learning. Depth learning is indicated by intrinsic motivation, which is more likely to occur in a trusting and supporting environment.

Many of the cultivars used in Turkmenistan until the time of independence from Russia were from Uzbekistan. Since independence, the original suite of long staple G. barbadense and medium staple Uzbek cultivars has been considerably changed in Turkmenistan by selection for early maturity and productivity. Cotton yields in Turkmenistan have been declining since independence and were below 2t/ha in 2001 when the TACIS &#8216;Support to the Cotton Sector Project&#8217; commenced, of which research reported in this thesis was a part. The main factors determining seed cotton yields in this country are quantity of irrigation water applied, nitrogen fertilization, deep ploughing, and plant population. Of these four important factors, plant density is the only one that individual farmers can control, as the others are either state controlled or require equipment held collectively. The aim of the research described in this thesis was to improve cotton production in Turkmenistan through optimising plant population. The use of optimum plant populations in the cotton fields of Turkmenistan has a substantial potential for economic benefit to the farmers of that country. Changing plant populations would require none of the structural changes involved in changing the other important yield factors. Quantity of irrigation water applied is controlled by the state; nitrogen fertilizer is a state controlled input in Turkmenistan and deep ploughing depends on equipment communally held and sometimes unavailable.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cotton growing</field><field name="subject">Turkmenistan</field><field name="subject">cotton</field><field name="subject">economic aspects</field><field name="subject">economic conditions</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/24512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family</field><field name="creator">Batho, Susan Smith</field><field name="description">Family is a work of creative fiction concerning four women and their relationships with each other.

Living conditions in my homeland, Thailand, dropped dramatically. Income decreased, the prices of essential goods increased, the stock market collapsed, loans turned to bad debts, businesses closed down while the prices of imported goods skyrocketed. The situation made the Thai people aware of the economic problems. This Thesis explores the cause of the crisis such as the central bank and the currency speculation, the poor use of foreign loans and the bubble in both the economy and the stock market. We will look deeply into the currency exchange system for its strong and weak points, over spending in every sector of the economy especially the real estate sector. We will investigate why the interest rate was so high in Thai financial markets. Econometrics is used to analyse the data in this thesis. From the analysis we will see that the Thai economy is moving towards a recession by itself, lacking any key institution to repair it. It can be seen in hindsight that these problems could have easily been corrected and Thailand could have well avoided the recession. Now the crisis is over, Thailand is in a period of economic reconstruction and, hopefully, the monetary crisis will not recur in Thailand.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">recessions</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">economic conditions</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/24617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fire frequencies for Western Sydney's woodlands : indications from vegetation dynamics</field><field name="creator">Watson, Penelope J.</field><field name="description">Although the importance of fire management for biodiversity conservation is increasingly being recognised, little is known about the relationship between fire regimes and plant diversity in Australia&#8217;s temperate grassy woodland ecosystems. This project sought to address this gap in the woodlands of Western Sydney&#8217;s Cumberland Plain. Aspects of vegetation dynamics were investigated through six studies, mostly in shale-based Cumberland Plain Woodland (CPW) remnants. Results indicate that fire frequency profoundly affects both vegetation composition and structure. The influence of fire cycles was most readily apparent in the shrub layer. Findings from the six studies were synthesized into a state and transition model which allows exploration of management actions. Interfire intervals between 4 and 12 years are predicted to maintain Themeda woodland with both Bursaria thickets and open areas, and obligate seeder shrubs. Variable intervals across time and space within these thresholds should maintain much of the landscape at fuel levels compatible with property protection; fuel loads in CPW peak well below those in woodlands on sandstone. Low fire frequency remnants dominated by Bursaria retain many conservation values, but are likely to support lower abundances of obligate seeder shrubs and open patch herbs, and to be more weed-prone, than remnants burnt once or twice a decade. Experimentation with one or two short interfire intervals may be appropriate in long unburnt CPW.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plants</field><field name="subject">effect of fires on</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">biological diversity</field><field name="subject">vegetation dynamics</field><field name="subject">fire ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/24673</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The flow of imagery elicited by G.I.M. music programs during unguided music imaging</field><field name="creator">Lem, Alan</field><field name="description">Guided Imagery and Music(GIM) is a method of psychotherapy using specifically prepared programs of classical music to facilitate altered states of consciousness and imagery.

Furthermore, the concept has been captured by uncritical, yet plausible, management commentators who have seemingly assumed that management efficiency will emerge from the adoption of their various prescriptions. The research will contribute to the general management literature through a cross-disciplinary critique and a re-interpretation of the notion of efficiency in management praxis. At a macro-level, the research advances the proposition that the notion of efficiency has become an ideological statement of support for any management intention, rather than a practical means to inform a range of management actions. A grounded theory of descriptive efficiency is proposed in order to explain the apparently unconscious application of laissez-faire and more contemporary principles of economics to management praxis and the wider management discipline without the support of a substantive elaboration of contemporary efficiency.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">efficient market theory</field><field name="subject">sales management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/24760</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genetic variation and evolution of the mitochondrial DNA non-coding region in Australian wild rabbit populations (Oryctolagus Cuniculus (L))</field><field name="creator">Zenger, Kyall Richard</field><field name="description">The extent of genetic structuring of a population results from a balance of forces producing local genetic differentiation, and counter-forces producing genetic homogeneity. An understanding of these forces is essential when investigating evolutionary processes in a species. It has been predicted that, when populations experience severe reductions in size, they lose genetic variability. Small population size may occur as a consequence of founder events, such as with the introduction and spread of a pest species. The predictions as described were examined by studying the molecular evolution and population genetics of European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus (L)) populations in Australia, using variation in mitochondrial DNA control region sequences. The results suggest that there is a higher rate of gene flow within populations in semi arid/arid areas, which is attributable to the extreme environmental heterogeneity found in these areas and may be best explained by a process whereby local populations becoming extinct and are recolonised by individuals drawn from other populations.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rabbits</field><field name="subject">genetics</field><field name="subject">mitochondrial DNA</field><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/24805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An historical survey of technology used in the production and presentation of music in the 20th Century</field><field name="creator">Lubin, Tom</field><field name="description">This paper explores the historical progression of the technological development of records and radio and its impact on popular music. It also includes the production technologies that create recorded music, the development of records, cassettes and CDs, and areas of reproduction that have an association with popular music including the sound technologies of radio, film, television, background music, and the juke-box. This paper is not a cultural or social study, but is primarily an historical account of media technology in music production and delivery. Certain social and cultural consequences and issues are included as background and sidebars to the primary topic. The technology of live performance has been omitted because it alone represents a body of material large enough for an entire paper. Western society now travels through a sea of music emanating from countless hidden sources. Such music delivery systems provide a continuous musical score for most people's personal histories. Sound, fragments of sound, and the very processes by which sound is created and manipulated have become products and commodities. The technology has allowed anyone to participate in the creation and hearing of music. This paper traces the history of the various technologies that, in so many respects, have provided a catalyst for that which is created, and the means by which music is listened to in the 20th Century. With rare exception, each new invention, delivery system, or process has had both supporters as well as detractors. Throughout this paper, both the positive as well as the negative effects of these developments will be explored.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sound</field><field name="subject">recording and reproducing</field><field name="subject">digital techniques</field><field name="subject">sound recording industry</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/24903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new regularization procedure for calculating the Casimir energy</field><field name="creator">Ghadirian, Bahman</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with the concepts of a very interesting phenomenon in quantum physics, the Casimir effect. Here the effect is investigated in detail and its importance to other areas of physics is analysed. The Casimir effect is produced by disturbing the vacuum energy when material boundaries or background fields are introduced in the vacuum. The usual approach to this effect is the vacuum fluctuation that has been studied in the past in relation to the discussion of the zero-point energy as a result of the field resemblance to the quantum harmonic oscillators, where residual ground state energy must be considered. In this thesis a new method to study vacuum fluctuations is presented. This new approach to the problem which is more classical is based on the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the very important fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The other aim of the thesis is to implement a new algorithm for regularizing the Casimir energy for a massive scalar field. Unlike the previous works on this problem by other authors that give approximate results, this attempt will produce precise results. My method is based on a new regularization procedure that allows us to employ the very reliable dimensional regularization scheme in place of a more mathematically complicated zeta-function regularization procedure. In order to achieve this goal I will deal with the problem by using the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula. The result will be a regularized Casimir energy for the case of a massive scalar field. This model may be used for the other geometrical boundaries and different fields.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum electrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Casimir effect</field><field name="subject">force and energy</field><field name="subject">quantum field theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/24942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A holistic approach to the management of electrical assets within an Australian supply utility</field><field name="creator">Brown, Colin</field><field name="description">Asset-rich organisations (utilities) within Australia have entered into an era of environmental change, imposed largely by successive Federal and State Governments wanting to exact financial returns from these State Owned Corporations (SOCs).

The theoretical, historical and pragmatic concerns of the thesis lie primarily in the media processes that are contextualized by several instances of ethnic resurgence. Indigenous narratives are located at the centre of various forms of cultural activism and are being conceived as tactics in the construction of divergent imaginaries and oppositional public spheres. By concentrating the study on the Mapuche context, the author clarifies the process by which these practices transform social structures in the struggle for political self-determination, cultural autonomy and social recognition.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalistic ethics</field><field name="subject">Chile</field><field name="subject">mass media</field><field name="subject">moral and ethical aspects</field><field name="subject">political aspects</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">social problems</field><field name="subject">press coverage</field><field name="subject">politics and government</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/25273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The flow of imagery elicited by G.I.M. music programs during unguided music imaging</field><field name="creator">Lem, Alan</field><field name="description">Guided Imagery and Music(GIM) is a method of psychotherapy using specifically prepared programs of classical music to facilitate altered states of consciousness and imagery. Whilst researchers and clinicians agree that music in GIM acts as a catalyst to the imagery response, little is known about the temporal effects of entire GIM programs. This study explores the premise that a continuous assessment of autonomic arousal may increase an understanding of time-varying relationships between the musical structure of GIM programs and the listener's imagery. In the final conclusion the author postulates that, although specific attributes of music may underpin specific imagery responses, it is the unique temporal structure of the entire GIM program that facilitates the continuous flow of the imagery. Recommendations are made for future research into the continuous response to music and imagery.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music therapy</field><field name="subject">psychotherapy</field><field name="subject">imagery</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/25707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The caking of lactose</field><field name="creator">Listiohadi, Yuanita D.</field><field name="description">This project has investigated the mechanism of caking of lactose and identified some possible solutions to minimise caking of lactose and dairy powders, additional to those suggested in the literature.

Accessing local IS to process data is no longer appropriate in the revolution of distributed processing. Web environments are heterogeneous and portable. First, the Web was developed for textual publishing purposes. However, in parallel the rapid advances of related technology and the incredible growth of ubiquitous data, the Web has evolved from a static medium for information sharing into an interactive multimedia platform that includes video, sound, animation, with dynamic links. In the light of these advancements, Web accessibility and associated problems (eg. People with deafness), represent a serious obstacle that prohibits people with special needs from accessing telecommunication systems. The Deaf Community&#8217; is almost a closed community that has its own language (i.e. sign language), customs and traditions. There is little research around the world investigating direct machine translation of sign language. To avoid machine translation and associated problems, this thesis built on current Web technology to integrate Signage Information into the Web environment. As part of this integration, it made use of an &#8216;Intermediary Signage Object&#8217; rather than intermediate transmission of video-based sign language. Finally, this thesis provides a Sign Language Annotation tool. It generates an XML document in order to process signage object content. The Graphical Usage Interface (GUI) contains a display window that plays customized sign language clips according to the sign viewers&#8217; preferences. The Signage Tool extends IBM VideoAnnEx Tool to include sign language attributes and related data. In addition, it has been developed for different types of users involved with the deaf community (i.e. hearing impairment, hard of hearing, and sign language interpreters.)</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sign language</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">deaf</field><field name="subject">means of communication</field><field name="subject">technological innovations</field><field name="subject">computerized self-help devices for the handicapped</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/25810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactions in the space of one tree</field><field name="creator">McComas Magers, Robyn</field><field name="description">This exegesis forms part of a cycle in the author's ongoing journey into the space of one tree, Eucalyptus gummifera. Many previously unchartered zones of experience give rise to experiences which are perceived slowly, with an open mind, in order to communicate an assemblage of experiences, objects and data which have come together to represent a reading of elements of the landscape of the Sydney Basin, one place where Eucalyptus gummifera grows. Each element has a niche within a specific grid of interaction that takes place in this lived environment. The work surveys fields of physical objects and relationships, inspiring new readings and translations of the landscape of one's own discoveries. Here the world acquires perspective and significance which enables fresh understandings and the deeper accquisition of knowledge.

It is set in a city where war is the norm, nightmare the standard, and ancient deities are called upon to witness the new order of killing technologies. The story is narrated by a woman chosen to be the consort of the General, a despostic war leader who believes that he has been chosen by the goddess Kali. She journeys deep into a horror which exists not only around her, but also within her. &#8216;Libertine&#8217;, by melding the erotic and the Gothic, tells the story of a woman enacting the role cast for her in the complex theatres of war. &#8216;A writer&#8217;s reflection&#8217; discusses the themes of the novel, introducing the notion of existential erotica. The existential experience particular to the expression of the erotic being is discussed, and the dilemma which arises from a self yearning to merge ecstatically with an/other in order to obtain a heightened or differently valued self. This theme is elaborated in &#8216;Libertine&#8217; with regard to subjectivity and the broader issues of nausea, horror and choice, drawing on the conventions of Gothic literature and apocalyptic visioning. This visioning, as eroticised death worship, is found in a Sadian credo of cruelty, the tantric rituals of Kali devotion, and the annihilating erotic excess propounded by Bataille. The monograph illustrated that &#8216;Libertine&#8217; is not a re-representation of these elements, but an original contribution to the literature of erotica.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women authors</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="subject">erotic literature</field><field name="subject">eroticism in literature</field><field name="subject">history and criticism</field><field name="subject">gothic revivial</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/26115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The lived experience of nursing dying or dead people</field><field name="creator">Chapman, Ysanne Beatrice</field><field name="description">This phenomenological study describes the experiences of twelve registered nurses who have nursed a dying or dead patient. These registered nurses come from a variety of backgrounds, not only personally, but also educationally and socially. The study primarily focuses on these registered nurses' most significant experience with death in a professional capacity. Twelve registered nurses were invited to share their stories by means of taped interviews and/or written narrative which attempted to discover the underlying meaning of their experiences. However, in relating their stories, many of the registered nurses wished to describe other death experiences which were of significance for them. The study is grounded in Heideggerian phenomenology and analysis of the transcripts revealed the emerging essences of connectedness, aloneness, questioning and accepting. The study further reveals that these essences align themselves to the four fundamental existentials of spatiality, corporeality, temporality and relationality as described by Merleau-Ponty (1962). Additionally, these essences are related back to the principles of Parse's (1987) theory of Human-Becoming and provide some insights for nursing practice when caring for the dying or the dead patient. Some discussion on how these insights may be related to contemporary nursing practice in Australia is highlighted. Each participant's transcript is followed by a poem which intends to capture the essence of their relationship with the situation(s) they have shared with the author.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">terminal care</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">death</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/26159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of Export Processing Zones in East Asian development: South Korea, Taiwan, China and Thailand</field><field name="creator">Zhu, Ying</field><field name="description">Export Processing Zones (EPZs) are about thirty years old now (ILO and UNCTC. 1988).

S. T.</field><field name="description">In New Zealand, there are many published guidelines about the management of riparian areas. The question needs to be asked, are these guides useful? This research thesis investigates the extent to which riparian management guides meet the needs of the users. This research also considers the importance of riparian management (with regards to the appropriateness of educational guides) in assisting practitioners and the interested public in the management of riparian areas.  The main way of investigating this topic was with the help of discussion groups. Discussion groups were held with interested organisations. These groups fell into three categories; Urban groups, Rural groups and Interest groups. The groups were asked to define what would make a guide most useful and desirable to them under three major categories: 1) what the guide looked like, 2) what information was contained, and 3) how was the information accessed. An opportunity was also provided for any further comments. This information was used to create a list of the most popular criteria that existing guides and further publications could be examined against. Eleven criteria were identified as follows: Information should be available online;	Have pictures; Include diagrams; Is simple and easy to understand; Contains how to and appropriate methods; Has a plant list; Considers maintenance issues; Identifies where to locate further information; How to contact experts; Is available in libraries; Is in booklet form.  The availability of existing information was investigated and its suitability assessed against the criteria. A list of all regional, territorial and unitary councils as well as 'other organisations' that were regarded as sources of environmental knowledge were investigated to see how many had produced information on riparian and wetland management issues. In terms of sources of information, 'other organisations' produce the greatest rate of riparian management information, followed by regional/unitary authorities. Two guides from Canterbury best meet the criteria identified by the interested parties, for the Canterbury region. Each scored 10/11 and failed on different criteria. This led to the conclusion that riparian management guides in Canterbury, while obviously still having room for improvement, are very close to meeting what interested parties feel is most important. Finally, a prototype (model) based on the research is provided for anyone who might be considering preparing a riparian management guide.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">riparian</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">effectiveness</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">environmental management</field><field name="subject">wetland</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Canterbury</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">environmental publication</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300803 Natural resources management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CFD optimisation of an oscillating water column wave energy converter</field><field name="creator">Horko, Michael</field><field name="description">Although oscillating water column type wave energy devices are nearing the stage of commercial exploitation, there is still much to be learnt about many facets of their hydrodynamic performance. This research uses the commercially available FLUENT computational fluid dynamics flow solver to model a complete OWC system in a two dimensional numerical wave tank. A key feature of the numerical modelling is the focus on the influence of the front wall geometry and in particular the effect of the front wall aperture shape on the hydrodynamic conversion efficiency. In order to validate the numerical modelling, a 1:12.5 scale experimental model has been tested in a wave tank under regular wave conditions. The effects of the front lip shape on the hydrodynamic efficiency are investigated both numerically and experimentally and the results compared. The results obtained show that with careful consideration of key modelling parameters as well as ensuring sufficient data resolution, there is good agreement between the two methods. The results of the testing have also illustrated that simple changes to the front wall aperture shape can provide marked improvements in the efficiency of energy capture for OWC type devices.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ocean wave power</field><field name="subject">Computational fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">Hydrodynamics -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Fluid dynamics -- Data processing</field><field name="subject">Wave energy</field><field name="subject">Hydrodynamic efficiency</field><field name="subject">Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)</field><field name="subject">Oscillating water column (OWC)</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0089</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The perceptions of a group of first year undergraduate Malawian students of the essay writing process</field><field name="creator">Kalikokha, Chimwemwe</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions of the essay writing process of first year undergraduates at Chancellor College (University of Malawi) and to a lesser extent those of the lecturers responsible for teaching academic skills. A mixed methods design, combining qualitative and quantitative techniques, was employed in order to obtain richer data for deeper understanding of the students&#8217; writing process. Two hundred students from the humanities and social science faculties responded to a self-completion questionnaire towards the end of semester one. Based on the students&#8217; responses, an open-ended questionnaire was administered to four full time English for Academic Purposes (EAP) instructors. Findings from this study indicate that most students find it very challenging to obtain sufficient and relevant source text information, paraphrase or summarise information, and use an appropriate academic writing style. As solutions to these challenges, the students suggested the need for timely essay writing instruction, availability of resources for essay writing, increased amount of time spent on essay writing instruction, and discipline specific instruction in essay writing. EAP instructors identified lack of teaching and learning materials, large EAP classes, and students&#8217; negative attitude towards the EAP course, as some of the challenges they encounter when teaching the course. The EAP instructors proposed an increase in the number of staff members, making students aware of the significance of the EAP course at an early stage, and the availability of up to date resources, as some of the ways in which the teaching of the course can be improved. Overall, the findings seem to suggest that difficulties that students encounter during the writing process and teaching challenges that EAP instructors face, have great impact on students&#8217; perception of academic writing as well as their approach to writing tasks. The findings also suggest a lack of dialogue between the students and their lecturers. This is evident in students&#8217; unawareness of the nature of the writing demands of their lecturers and disciplines; students&#8217; desire to have timely essay writing instruction; and the lecturers&#8217; concerns about students&#8217; negative attitude towards the EAP course.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication between lecturers and students</field><field name="subject">Tertiary writing skills</field><field name="subject">Essay writing strategies</field><field name="subject">Academic writing challenges</field><field name="subject">English for Academic Purposes EAP</field><field name="subject">Tertiary instruction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sleep and Breathing at High Altitude</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Pamela Lesley</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosphy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sleep architecture, high altitude, periodic breathing, overnight oxygen saturation, acute mountain sickness, non invasive positive pressure ventilation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wave-Associated Seabed Behaviour near Submarine Buried Pipelines</field><field name="creator">Shabani, Behnam</field><field name="description">Master of Engineering (Research)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Submarine Pipeline</field><field name="subject">Consolidation</field><field name="subject">3D</field><field name="subject">Seabed Instability</field><field name="subject">Liquefaction</field><field name="subject">Shear Failure</field><field name="subject">Biot Theory</field><field name="subject">Finite Element</field><field name="subject">WSPI</field><field name="subject">WSPI3D</field><field name="subject">Ocean Wave</field><field name="subject">Offshore Pipeline</field><field name="subject">Offshore Structure</field><field name="subject">Three Dimensional Model</field><field name="subject">Seabed</field><field name="subject">Pore Pressure</field><field name="subject">Soil Stress</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the wall : an investigation into the relationship between industrial design and science fiction : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirement of the degree of Master of Design, Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Garrett, Lyn Karena</field><field name="description">The study aimed to develop a theory describing the nature of the relationship between industrial design and science fiction, based on the observation that science fiction caninspire industrial designers and enrich industrial design processes and products. The hypotheses were that: 1. The roles of industrial design and science fiction are based on parallel ideas. 2. Industrial design is suffused with, and sympathetic to, science fiction thinking. 3. There is a &#8216;cause and effect&#8217; relationship between aspects of industrial design and science fiction. Science fiction cinema is a key &#8216;cause and effect&#8217;. 4. Science fiction cinema performs a key function in the roles of science fiction, and cinema can be employed to explore and discuss the roles of industrial design and science fiction. The study used a range of research methods. An extensive literature review critically compared and analysed the characteristics and roles of science fiction and industrial design. The analysis identified contrasting and common themes, ideas, processes, texts and subtexts between the two areas. The findings were further analysed using graphic analytical tools, to form models that described and structured the industrial design/science fiction relationship. Three case studies were used to further test the model: the work of industrial designer and visual futurist Syd Mead; science fiction author Bruce Sterling; and the industrial design and production design content of selected science fiction films. Analysis of an Internet discussion among industrial designers also illuminated the model. The findings from the analysis and the case studies supported the validity of the original hypotheses. The study identified as the key elements of an emerging theory the parallel ideas of innovation in industrial design and novum (the new thing) in science fiction; the cause and effect relationship found between the two disciplines; the parallel concepts of mediation and responsibility in industrial design, and anticipation and interrogation in science fiction. The theory was presented as a graphic model that demonstrated these elements. This study concludes that science fiction challenges the design profession to produce better design by requiring that social, political, and technological contexts in which products will exist are explicitly understood and addressed. This is mapped out in an emerging theory that outlines a complex, multi-layered relationship between industrialdesign and science fiction. In industrial design terms, this emerging theory could be considered a prototype.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">industrial design</field><field name="subject">science fiction</field><field name="subject">emerging theory</field><field name="subject">science fiction cinema</field><field name="subject">production design</field><field name="subject">forecasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and Reactions of Iron and Ruthenium Dinitrogen Complexes</field><field name="creator">Guest, Ruth Winifred</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organometallic Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fable of all our lives : a novel</field><field name="creator">Kocan, Peter, 1947-</field><field name="description">The creative component of a Doctor of Creative Arts thesis submitted under the general title The shelter of honour.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian fiction</field><field name="subject">21st century</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/29359</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface properties of polymeric surfactants</field><field name="creator">Court, Colin Edwin</field><field name="description">Polystyrenes with carboxyl end-groups (PS-COOH)and poly (tert-butyl acrylates) (PtBA) of different molar mass were synthesised by anionic polymerisation using n-butyllithium as the initiator.

To gain a deepened understanding of our ecological crises from depth psychological, holistic, and transpersonal perspectives, a number of counsellors, psychotherapists, naturopaths, and one environmental educator were either interviewed or completed questionnaires that explored the meaning of the terms &#8216;environment&#8217; and &#8216;sustainability&#8217;. They were also invited to express their views on environmental deterioration and what it means to them to live sustainably. The knowledge obtained from the research participants, an extensive literature review, and my professional experience as a psychotherapist, workshop facilitator and trainer, suggest that the current dominant theories and practices of environmental education, and other change practices, are limited in their effectiveness. The study proceeds with a discussion of key issues related to the ecological approach proposed in this study; and of emergent areas such as environmental education, education for sustainability, deep ecology and ecofeminism. A critique focuses particularly on the common assumption of conventional learning paradigms that deep change can be achieved without addressing emotional resistance to such change. By using the work of the Resilience Alliance, &#8220;a multidisciplinary research group that explores the dynamics of complex adaptive as a reference point it is argued that our need to compensate for our fragmented selves leads to significant resistances to changes in consciousness. The study concludes with a summary of the main findings and thoughts on possible sustainable and unsustainable futures.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">government policy</field><field name="subject">environmentalism</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">environmental psychology</field><field name="subject">economic development</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">human ecology</field><field name="subject">moral and ethical aspects</field><field name="subject">environmental ethics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/29537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis of novel O-alkyl analogues of the energy-repartitioning [beta]-agonist clenbuterol and their physiological and immunological characterisations</field><field name="creator">Barden, Timothy John</field><field name="description">It was proposed that some O-alkyl analogues of the beta-adrenergic agonist clenbuterol would be effective structural and functional congeners of clenbuterol which may then be used for the production of clenbuterol-specific idiotypic antibodies. These antibodies could possibly then be used to generate anti-idiotypic antibodies that mimic the energy-repartitioning effects of clenbuterol. Therefore, the aim of this work was to synthesise and characterise these compounds, evaluate their physiological effects, characterise the specificity of antibodies produced in response to protein conjugates of two of the novel compounds, and then use this data to determine the utility of these compounds for the generation of anti-idiotype antibodies which mimic clenbuterol. The target compounds were synthesised in five steps from 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxyacetophenone in overall yields of 5-28%. A synthetic scheme similar to that which has led to clenbuterol was used to form the phenylethanolamine backbone, with modifications to include the O-alkyl moiety via a modified Williamson ether synthesis, and elimination of a synthetic chlorination step. Overall, 15 new compounds were synthesised, which were characterised and their structure confirmed from proton and carbon-13 NMR, IR and mass spectral data. The two haptenic analogues were then conjugated to carrier proteins using carbodiimide-based chemistries. In conclusion, the results indicated that the O-alkyl analogues, although structurally similar, were ineffective functional mimics of clenbuterol. Therefore, the anti-clenbuterol antobodies produced from the novel O-alkyl analogues would appear to be unsuitable for production of anti-idiotypic antibodies that mimic the energy-repartitioning effects of clenbuterol since the antibodies were unable to distinguish between the compound which demonstrated energy-repartitioning effects (clenbuterol) and those that did not (O-alkyl clenbuterol analogues).</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anti-idiotypic antibodies</field><field name="subject">immunoglobulins</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/29572</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of thiacrown and azacrown ethers based on the spiroacetal framework</field><field name="creator">Nikac, Marica</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the synthesis of novel thiacrown and azacrown ethers based on the 1.7-dioxaspiro[5.5] undecane ring system.

Thirty four of these samples were tested for possible use as clay body ingredients, while sixty five samples were selected for assessment as glaze ingredients. A wood fired kiln was built from firebricks produced from a local deposit of a white bauxite related material. Materials selected as a result of these tests were combined to create ceramic objects fired at stoneware temperatures. The most interesting result of the investigation was the discovery of a number of small weathered dykes and sills, samples from which were developed into workable ceramic clay bodies and glazes using a simple empirical testing procedure. A previously unknown excellent white translucent native porcelain stone or &#8216;bai tunze&#8217; was discovered and developed into a workable porcelain body. Some iron stained porcelain bodies that &#8216;flashed&#8217; red in the wood firing kiln were also developed. Exhibitions of the creative work produced were shown in the &#8216;Legge Gallery&#8217;, a Fine Art gallery in Sydney. Two critical reviews of those shows appeared in the magazine Craft Arts International, No. 64, 2005, pp 106-107 and The Journal of Australian Ceramics, Vol 46 #1 pp 21-24. Several papers were published detailing various aspects of the research: &#8220;The Search for Raw Materials in the Southern Highlands&#8221; in The Journal of Australian Ceramics, Vol 41#3, pp 22-23; &#8220;Flotation &#8211; A method of refining useful minerals&#8221;, in The Journal of Australian Ceramics, Vol 41#3, pp 24-25; &#8220;Magic Dirt&#8221; in The Journal of Australian Ceramics, Vol 46 #1 pp 76-79; &#8220;New work from an old landscape&#8221;, in Ceramics Technical, 24, 2007. pp 45-52;&#8220;From the ground up&#8221;, in Ceramic review, issue 222, 2006, pp 54-55. The research concludes that the Southern Highlands of New South Wales is geologically rich in suitable materials for the production of stoneware ceramics and that there are a few specific bai tunze like materials that are very interesting and have considerable aesthetic potential. The research determined that these bai tunze like materials are potentially capable of being developed into clay bodies and glazes of great beauty.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ceramic materials</field><field name="subject">clay minerals</field><field name="subject">pottery</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Southern Highlands</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/29709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A one-dimensional Boussinesq-type momentum model for steady rapidly varied open channel flows</field><field name="creator">Zerihun, Yebegaeshet Tsegaye</field><field name="description">The depth-averaged Saint-Venant equations, which are used for most computational flow models, are adequate in simulating open channel flows with insignificant curvatures of streamlines. However, these equations are insufficient when applied to flow problems where the effects of non-hydrostatic pressure distribution are predominant. This study provides a comprehensive examination of the feasibility of a simple one-dimensional Boussinesq-type model equation for such types of flow problems. This equation, which allows for curvature of the free surface and a non-hydrostatic pressure distribution, is derived using the momentum principle together with the assumption of a constant centrifugal term at a vertical section. Besides, two Boussinesq-type model equations that incorporate different degrees of corrections for the effects of the curvature of the streamline are investigated in this work. One model, the weakly curved flow equation model, is the simplified version of the flow model based on a constant centrifugal term for flow situations that involve weak streamline curvature and slope, and the other, the Boussinesq-type momentum equation linear model is developed based on the assumption of a linear variation of centrifugal term with depth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flow simulation, open channel flow, hydrodynamics, Boussinesq equation, rapidly varied flow</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computer mediated multimodal text production: ten-year-olds crossing semiotic boundaries</field><field name="creator">Vincent, John Terence</field><field name="description">In any standard school class there will be a wide range of learning style preferences. To develop a writing curriculum that meets the needs of each style is a pursuit that has been only superficially explored. This study has addressed some of the issues involved in understanding the writing needs of a wide range of styles. It has accomplished this by the researcher studying one class of ten-year-olds through becoming their full-time teacher for one year. A programme of text production was planned and implemented that took the students from monomodal, handwritten texts, via wordprocessed monomodal and partially multimodal texts, to fully multimodal computer-mediated texts. A weak pedagogical framing was deliberately established as the learning environment, and computer technology was constantly available. By observing the changes over a ten-month period and analysing in detail the learning environment that was the same for all 26 students, it has been possible to see strong patterns emerging from the data. This patterning has been matched with the cognitive styles of the students as assessed by a cognitive styles analysis. Some students, mainly those with a strong imager cognitive style and who were struggling or failing with literacy in the monomodal sense, have been shown to require multimodal scaffolding to successfully communicate with texts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multimedia, writing, transmediation, semiotics</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Courts on trial : who appears for the defence? : a discouse analysis of politics the judiciary and media reporting of justice</field><field name="creator">Schulz, Pamela</field><field name="description">The communication project reported in this thesis examines critically a set of very specific discourses which have evolved within court reporting in Australia, especially as displayed in media headlines.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/43001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cognitive approach to foreign-inspired Chinese terms</field><field name="creator">Li, Suogui</field><field name="description">This thesis has aimed to set out the classification and word production of foreign-inspired Chinese terms (FICT) within the language system of modern Chinese. FICT refers to a group of vocabulary items in Chinese as a recipient language, where formation is motivated by foreign entities or concepts and designated by some foreign words, but no established foreign elements are in fact transferred from the donor language. The thesis establishes a group of terms identified as a particular category of Chinese borrowings according to the motivation of word production, concerning human bodily perception and cognition experience of foreign entities or concepts. Chinese borrowing is categorized as four types: phonic loans, semantic loans, loan blends and FICT, based on the motivation of sound, form and meaning of foreign words, and sensory perception and cognition of foreign entities and concepts. Cognitive semantics, adopted as an approach in the thesis, is a study of mind and its relationship with embodied experience and culture. Employing language as a key methodological tool for uncovering conceptual organization and structure, this study explores the methods of FICT word production, such as sensory perceptual and metaphorical production in terms of principles of cognitive semantics within the Chinese language system. The various types of Chinese borrowings are analysed in terms of the theory of categorization, and FICT in particular are examined under the semantic model proposed here. It is hoped that the thesis is able to open a new approach to the investigation of Chinese loan words and the process of FICT word production within cognitive semantics.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese language</field><field name="subject">terms and phrases</field><field name="subject">foreign elements</field><field name="subject">foreign words and phrases</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/26322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lubricity : power, sovereign violence and erotic hope</field><field name="creator">Wadiwel, Dinesh Joseph</field><field name="description">The original impulse sparking this project &#8211; namely the paradox of suffering and violence in the twentieth century- guides the reader along an unexpected set of detours, occasionally drawing one away from the usual watering holes of political theory.

It looks at many discursive and concrete examples of cosmetic surgery and casts a net that is inclusive of a wide variety of voices. These discourses are analysed in relation to the idea of &#8216;makeover culture&#8217;. Makeover culture is shown to be an increasingly important part of everyday life that is not confined to &#8211; but is particularly evident within &#8211; cosmetic surgery. For my purposes &#8216;makeover culture&#8217; describes the set of cultural logics &#8211; the landscapes &#8211; in which cosmetic surgery is embedded. In these environments cosmetic surgery is an important part of a socio-cultural paradigm that values endless remaking, improving, renovating, importing and rejuvenating. The thesis&#8217; theoretical cauldron contains cultural studies, media studies, feminist philosophy, actor-network theory, feminist theories of space, and psychoanalysis. I analyse cosmetic surgery as it appears in many media-scapes. The public narratives of some famous &#8216;extreme practitioners&#8217; of cosmetic surgery are reviewed, as well as the stories of those celebrities who are secretive about cosmetic surgery and aim for a more &#8216;natural&#8217; look. Also carefully analysed are the cosmetic surgery experiences told to me by more everyday recipients and doctors in interviews. I aim to develop a feminist understanding of contemporary cosmetic surgery that is beyond ideas of agent and victim, that goes further than the rhetoric of &#8216;just don&#8217;t do it&#8217;, that sees more similarities than differences between women who choose cosmetic surgery and women who don&#8217;t, and that positions the doctor/patient relationship inside a network of technologies and assemblages that includes many actors. The thesis offers suggestions about how people &#8211; especially women &#8211; may live critically and constructively with cosmetic surgery in all its contradictory, concrete, discursive, and imaginary forms. It acknowledges that there are complex pleasures and desires associated with cosmetic surgery, intertwined with its offensiveness and terrors.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">surgery, plastic</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">body, human</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/26405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marxism, revolution and law : the experience of early Soviet Russia</field><field name="creator">Head, Michael O.</field><field name="description">The 1917 Soviet Revolution in Russia was an attempt to fundamentally reorganise economic, social and legal life along anti-capitalist, participatory and egalitarian lines. This thesis suggests seven criteria for assessing the early Soviet legal debates: 1/. Broad ranging legal debates 2/ The social and historical context 3/. The legal record of Soviet Russia 4/. The socialist opposition 5/. Classical Marxist legal theory 6/. The axis of the early debates 7/. The contrast with Stalinism. An introduction explains the parameters of the thesis. Chapter 1 examines the classical Marxist theory of law and the state. Chapters 2 and 3 review the revolution&#8217;s context: the pre-1917 legal record and the political physiognomy and dynamics of the 1917 revolution. Chapters 4 and 5 probe the legal record of early Soviet Russia, and Lenin&#8217;s views on law. Chapter 6 reviews the legal debates, while chapters 7 and 8 focus on the particular contributions of Stuchka and Pashukanis. Chapter 9 examines the impact of the Socialist opposition, most notably the Left Opposition formed by Leon Trotsky at the end of 1923.

SR motors require precise control to optimise the operating efficiency; two controllers are proposed and built to operate the switched reluctance motor. The primary objectives of this thesis are: &#8226; To investigate the developed torque optimization for switched reluctance (SR) motors as a function of various dimensions e.g. pole arc/pole pitch variation, stator shape variation and rotor shape variation. This investigation is achieved through the simulation using Finite Element Method (FEM), MATLAB/SIMULINK. &#8226; The two proposed controllers are designed and built to carry out the experimental testing of SRM. The most versatile SRM converter topology is the classic bridge converter topology with two power switches and two diodes per phase. The first controller consists of a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and the classic bridge converter, this Programmable Logic Controller uses a simple language (ladder language) for programming the application code, reliable, and contains timers. The second controller consists of a cam positioner, encoder and the classic bridge converter, this cam positioner is easy to be programmed, high-speed operation, and this cam positioner has 8 outputs. This thesis is organized as follows: Chapter 1 describes the background, the present and future trends for the SRM. This chapter shows the design, control, finite element analysis, fuzzy logic control the for a switched reluctance (SR) motor (literature review). Chapter 2 describes the theory and principle of finite element method, as applied to SR motors. Chapter 3 describes the simulation results for serious of switched reluctance motor designs by changing (_) rotor pole arc / pole pitch ratio, and (_) stator pole arc / pole pitch ratio, for 3 Phase, 6/4 Poles SRM and 4 Phase, 8/6 Poles SRM. The results are obtained through finite element method (FEM) and MATLAB-SIMULINK. Chapter 4 describes the theory of fuzzy logic controller (FLC). This chapter shows the simulation results for the FLC. Chapter 5 describes the proposed programmable logic controller (PLC), and associated hardware and software. The proposed programmable logic controller produces lower speed. The cam positioner controller produces higher speed; the experimental results for both controllers are presented and discussed. Chapter 6 describes the summary of results from earlier chapters to draw the final conclusion for the thesis. The recommendations for further research are also discussed. Appendix A describes the program code for the PLC controller. Appendix B contains a CD of photos album, video clips for the PLC controller and cam positioner controller.

It has been more than a decade of political and social processes, full of uncertainties, doubts and compromises. It has been a transition marred by the political and economic remnants of the military dictatorship, by a highly restrictive and authoritarian legal and constitutional system, and by a political class, and, for a long period unable to introduce truly democratic changes. The dynamic of the Chilean transition has had a deep effect on many sections of the Chilean society, especially the media, traditionally one of the key spheres of public debate. The underlying argument of this work is that the Chilean transition to democracy, a political and economic phase achieved by negotiation and compromise, was not accompanied by the establishment of a more democratic, pluralistic media system. This thesis examines, from a multidisciplinary perspective, the context, the process and the development of the media during the first decade of the transition to democracy (1990-2000). Its fundamental objective is to understand the relationship between journalism, the media and the democratic political processes in a post-dictatorship society.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human rights</field><field name="subject">Chile</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">politics and government</field><field name="subject">mass media</field><field name="subject">moral and ethical aspects</field><field name="subject">journalistic ethics</field><field name="subject">authoritarianism</field><field name="subject">social problems</field><field name="subject">press coverage</field><field name="subject">moral and ethical aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/26597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of the cellulose and cement mineral bond and the mechanism of aluminous compounds in retarding cement carbonation</field><field name="creator">Peng, Joe Zhou</field><field name="description">Analysis of calcium and oxygen atom arrays of known cement minerals and the structures of cellulose polymorphs were performed to see if it was possible to arrange a cellulose fibre on a cement mineral face such that the fibre is bonded by a repeating array of hydrogen or hydroxide coordination bonds for the full length of the attachment.

Traditional gathering practices became one of the important forces that influenced and shaped the work of many women artists in post colonial Australia. Interacting with the landscape on a personal level helped contextualize women's gathering role into a contemporary theme, which linked past knowledge to present day voices. The author's art work is an interpretation of this traditional gathering practice. By relating herbal knowledge to present day concerns, she is able to extend the knowledge of past generations of women gatherers into present day images. The art work is also a diary of experiments, that are concerned with preserving the dye making recipes that have been handed down for generations. These botanical experiments have enabled the author to re-present herbal knowledge that took hundreds of years to glean, and to extend the use of the dyes obtained to create the art works.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women artists</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">women in art</field><field name="subject">women immigrants</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">herbs</field><field name="subject">naturalism in art</field><field name="subject">plants in art</field><field name="subject">painting</field><field name="subject">dyes and dyeing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/27666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Precision irrigation for grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.) under RDI and PRD</field><field name="creator">Fuentes, Sigfredo</field><field name="description">Water is a scarce resource worldwide and a particular problem for producers of wine grapes in Australia and Chile where periodic drought severely limits vine growth. Most vineyards in these countries are irrigated and the development of efficient water management practices for vineyards is required. Strategies such as regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) and partial root zone drying (PRD) have been introduced with the objective of maximising the efficiency of water use relative to yield while ensuring that grape quality is not compromised. The problem is that the advantages of these strategies can only be realised if there is accurate information about weather parameters, spatial distribution of soil moisture and vine water use and status. This information can then be used to provide answers for growers to the key irrigation questions of when to irrigate and how much water to apply. The overarching hypothesis of this thesis was than an integrated approach to irrigation scheduling incorporating data on weather, physiological status of the vines and soil wetting patterns is essential to accurately target the narrow range of soil moisture and vine stress thresholds required for realising the advantages of RDI and PRD. The hypothesis was tested through a series of field experiments. The results supported that an integrated approach to irrigation produces the most desirable outcomes in terms of water use and berry quality irrespective of irrigation strategies. The most appropriate way to answer the question of when to irrigate is to measure stem rather than leaf water potential. The question of how much water to apply can readily be answered using a new technique and software developed in this study. It was concluded that PRD is more difficult to manage than RDI because of the complexity pf PRD and the financial and logistic requirements of a double irrigation line. PRD had no effect on crop water use efficiency, berry quality or yield when the same amount of water was applied in the PRD and conventional drip treatments.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">irrigation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">viticulture</field><field name="subject">grapes</field><field name="subject">Chile</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/27689</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Progressing towards conservatism : a gramscian challenge to the conceptualisation of class, agency, corruption and reform in 'progressive' analyses of policing</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Michael H.</field><field name="description">This thesis about rank and file police takes place from within a class framework with its foundations in the works of Marx, Engels and Gramsci who theorised that revolution is the result of the contradictions in class society reaching breaking point.

C. A</field><field name="description">The main assertion of this thesis is that both 19th century and contemporary Gothic literary texts are characterised by fugitivity, embodied by the fugitive &#8216;figure&#8217; which through its ambiguity is re-deploying the distinction proposed by Ross Chambers &#8211; inescapably both narrative and textual. The fugitive figure is intimately related to desire and its textual mobilisation. This mobilisation simulates the paradoxical experience of the sublime in which the pursuer of the fugitive figure is left speechless before the feared and desired unnamable other. Anne Rice&#8217;s &#8216;The vampire chronicles&#8217; are discussed, as are &#8216;Frankenstein&#8217;, &#8216;The strange case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&#8217; and &#8216;Dracula&#8217;. Analysis of these texts constitutes a &#8216;genealogy&#8217;, conceived and executed in poststructuralist terms, consisting of a deconstructive analysis inflected by psychoanalytic inputs. The genealogy is applied to indicate the importance of the family structure and its potential for dissolution in Gothic texts, and recreates a search for origins, which is a recurring theme in Gothic writing. The fugitive figure, through its embodiment of insatiable desire, is beyond either narrative or tropaic apprehension. It is in continual metamorphosis and invites pursuit in its different guises. However, although it appears as the objectified pursued, it actually arises from within the pursuer, so any attempt to arrest the disruptive flow it signifies is, although unavoidable and necessary, a self-deceptive act doomed to failure. This failure is registered simultaneously at narrative and textual levels.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gothic revival</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">history and criticism</field><field name="subject">horror tales</field><field name="subject">fugitive in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/27799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Real numbers, imaginary guests, and fantastic experiences : the Grand Seaside Hotel and the discursive construction of customer service</field><field name="creator">Bunzel, Dirk</field><field name="description">Based on a fourteen-month period of ethnographic research conducted in an Australian Coastal hotel, this thesis explores the issues of management in a flexible organization. Using a textual approach to the study of organizations, the thesis focusses on the customer service discourse, its constituents, and the processes of its symbolic (re-) production in the hotel studied. Using a variety of textual data-among them academic publications from authors as diverse as Foucault, Clegg, Haugaard, Ritzer and Castoriadis; various forms of fieldnotes; and detailed descriptions of ritual and ceremonial events - the thesis not only provides a vivid account of organizational life at the hotel, it also identifies aspects of the latter such as meetings, training and reward programmes, and customer response schemes, as disciplinary technologies applied to govern both employees and customers. Extending the considerations about the disciplinary qualities of the customer service discourse and linking them with the issues of new forms of control as recently debated in the larger field of organization studies, the thesis will identify the processes of imagination, normalization, and subjugation as central to the establishment of a new management doctrine: corporate culturism. This discussion will also reveal the essentially hybrid nature of control under this new doctrine and it will expose the process of managing meaning as fundamental to its constitution and endurance. Respectively, the thesis will identify the hotel studied as an organization that thrives on corporate culturism. As the thesis represents a contribution to the field of (organizational) ethnography, it will - by recurrently reflecting on some of the contemporary debates in the field- implicitly address status and practicability of empirical (ethnographic) research in a postmodern world.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personnel management</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">service industries</field><field name="subject">hospitality industry</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/27816</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Redfern kids connect : technology and empowerment</field><field name="creator">Sengara, Ryan</field><field name="description">Redfern Kids Connect is a community technology project that has run in inner-city Sydney since 2002. Redfern is known to many as the heart of urban Aboriginal Australia and as a diverse community facing challenges around poverty, crime and race relations. For three years, children (8-12 years old), and volunteers (university students and young professionals) have met each Saturday to play on computers and socialise. The project&#8217;s experiences with relationships, technology, and empowerment have been as confusing as they have been exciting. In the spirit of action research, this thesis explores the impacts the project has had. Uniquely embedded in the process of reflection occurring away from its on-the-ground activities, it tells the project&#8217;s story through the eyes of its volunteers. The research concludes that the project's main contributions to empowerment have been through building social capital (Cox, Putnam) and improving new forms of literacy (Warschauer). Vital to supporting and extending these outcomes have been taking a social approach to supporting technology use, shaping a safe and open environment (Marvin et. al), supporting critical thinking and expression (Freire) and examining the project 'behind the scenes'. The author takes the dual role of researcher and participant in the research.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">Redfern (N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">social conditions</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural studies</field><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/27868</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between leadership and employee empowerment for successful total quality management</field><field name="creator">Gale, Lesia</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to assist industry leaders in Australia understand the nature of employee empowerment by identifying the characteristics of employee empowerment, the leadership strategies required to guide employee behaviour changes and the interaction between the two concepts. This thesis argues that in the 1990's the role of leadership needs to change in order to address the threat of increasing competition. The role of leadership needs to focus on employee development and enhancing their ability to adapt to change, be innovative, creative and committed to achieving the goals of the organisation. Effective leadership is therefore reflected in the behaviour of employees. A characteristic identified as employee empowerment. The research for this study had two components. First was the development of the model to investigate the relationship between leadership strategies and employee empowerment behaviour in a workplace setting. The second research component of the study was testing the model. Testing required the development of a multi-component workplace survey instrument. A range of validation methodologies supported the survey instrument. The case study site was a government organisation. Results provided answers to each of the research questions. Among other findings, it was found that factors other than leadership could also moderate empowerment behaviours. The results of the study, if replicated, have important significance to Australian industry. Serious questions are raised concerning the direction of previous leadership research. Furthermore a new focus is provided to explain why TQM fails in organisations. Another key point highlighted in the study was the importance of using practical models that can be tested in the workplace.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">total quality control</field><field name="subject">total quality management</field><field name="subject">benchmarking</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">organizational effectiveness</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">management audit</field><field name="subject">employee empowerment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/28037</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Music of balance : circles and squares</field><field name="creator">Handel, Amanda Jane</field><field name="description">Music of balance is a portfolio of eight compositions, all of which bear the concealed influence of mandalas in their conception - these are made manifest musically in cycle structures with shifting drones, pedals and tonal ambiguities.The compositional process maximises minimal materials - circles and squares - symbolically. Organising thought, feeling and knowledge into a balanced acoustic music form of expression is the objective of this creative project - which is carried out under the influence of symbols. Whilst the compositional processes are intuitive, they involve a disciplinary measure which employs the circle and the square as tools. Acting symbolically these tools imbue the music with deeper meaning than the obvious listening surface, and provide a rich substance of sound. Programmatic influences have been absented; replaced instead by the language of symbols - namely the mandala symbol. A range of apparent opposites arising from circles and squares - physical/ephemeral matter, chronological/eternal time and form/expression - are investigated for musical reconciliation. The compositional exploration is guided and focused by the circle in a square image understood as a universal symbol (grounded in the ancient Indian Arts, Tibetan Buddhism, Sufism and Jungian psychology), and active in representing, and thus restoring the natural balance of the soul in the universe.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">21st century</field><field name="subject">guitar music</field><field name="subject">piano music</field><field name="subject">composition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/26753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">My vicious angel : a one-act play with music</field><field name="creator">Evans, Christine</field><field name="description">In My Vicious Angel, wave-like musical time, with its rhythms, echoes and repetitions, is counterposed in both harmony and discord to linear narrative time, with its implied causality and its imperative need to subordinate the journey to the destination. In drawing on the tension between certain musical and narrative modes of address, the author has tried to foreground the volatility of time's relation to trauma and to memory. It is an anecdotal truism that in accidents, time slows down, emotion is suspended and sensory impressions acquire an extraordinary clarity and intensity. If traumatic incidents form a kind of rupture to the fabric of narrative time, how might this impact on the ongoing weaving of narrative? What kinds of rhythms, shock waves, stammerings result? Further, if the emotional charge of any event affects the subjective organisation of time, very quickly the tight weave of the linear narrative begins to resemble something more like beginners' macrame. If the writing has resonance, it does so because it finds a sympathetic emptiness, an echo chamber within the listener where the dialogue can move in counterpoint to lines of story already begun elsewhere which rub up against each other and whisper in the dark, travelling (like water, like memory) in waves.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian drama</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="subject">music by women composers</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">scores</field><field name="subject">musicals</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/26803</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nurses' perceptions of their health education and health promotion role when caring for hospitalised people who have diabetes mellitus</field><field name="creator">Speerin, Robyn Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to document and explore the perceived role of nurses and their attitudes and beliefs when providing health promotion strategies and health education for hospitalised people who have diabetes mellitus (diabetes).

It will discuss realist conventions and devices applied in the novel, such as plot and character, and examine their effectiveness, or limits, in telling a story. The writing of this novel was prompted by the relentless stream of political events that has flowed through the recent history of Singapore. Since the island's independence from British colonial rule in 1965, a small ruling elite embarked on a ferocious nation-building programme that has not always recognised its citizens as individuals, but rather more collectively as workers, managers, professionals, housewives and students: each group expected to perform a specific role in society. State apparatuses such as law enforcement, the civil service and the mass media are engineered to direct the conduct of citizens from cradle to grave. This instigated, and provided the background to, the writing of Plato's Illusion. An objective of this novel is to document as well as imaginatively capture life in Singapore under its prevailing authoritarian rule. The writing strategy adopted is to represent politics in terms of individual 'common' experience, for almost every aspect of the private citizen's life has been politicised in Singapore. Government intervention and manipulation are situated in the personal affairs of attending university, getting a job, finding a husband and having children. In other words, by portraying the process and effects of those interventions on the characters in the novel, the body politics will simultaneously take on a more concrete shape with a face and an attitude. This strategy, used in the development of plot and characters, would be a good representation of life in Singapore, if the effects of government policies and the personal psyche were thoroughly explored and articulated.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="subject">politics and government</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/27293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Playing their game : an exploration of academic resistance in the managerial university</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Gina</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the phenomenon of academics&#8217; resistance to materialism in Australian universities. In common with many other public sector employees, academics have experienced significant changes in the management of their institutions over recent years. Many of these changes are associated with increasing &#8216;managerialism&#8217; &#8211; the application of methods and approaches commonly associated with the private sector, to public sector organizations. While previous studies indicate that academics are broadly opposed to such changes, little Australian research has considered how they might be resisting managerialism, in their daily working lives. The study found that academics were resisting managerial practices in a variety of ways. These included public acts of protest, refusal and more &#8216;everyday&#8217; forms of resistance, such as avoidance and strategic compliance. This resistance was underpinned by shared understandings, values and norms embedded within traditional academic culture, and reflected academics&#8217; negative assessments of the consequences of managerial practices within their institutions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education, higher</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">universities and colleges</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">educational change</field><field name="subject">university cooperation</field><field name="subject">college teachers</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/27335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A poetics of foreignness</field><field name="creator">Zournazi, Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the ontology and epistemology of foreignness. With other issues,it developed through a series of conversations on foreignness with Australian and international writers and intellectuals, and a subsequent series of radio essays and conversations based on some of the dialogues. A critical framework is developed which examines the relationships between foreignness, cultural identity and the practice of writing through a series of dialogues. The author's analysis involves exploring how the conversations 'speak' the personal and political experiences of living and writing as a foreigner. The interest lies in the various ways narrating one's life touches on certain elements in the aesthetics and politics of writing.The politics of experience and aesthethic production intertwine throughout the conversations and in the production of the text. As the thesis is dialogic in character, the reader can choose to work through the thesis in a linear fashion or to begin at any part. In this sense, the work is divided into three interrelated parts which can be read as different translations of each other. In the last part, in CD format, the author discusses and includes as a postscript to the research, the radio essays and dialogues based on conversations. It is suggested how these radio conversations enact a different way of speaking and writing about foreignness, and explore the on-going relationships between dialogue, translation and a critical imagination.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">dialogue</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/27424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Area : the big cover-up</field><field name="creator">McPhail, Diane</field><field name="description">The research problem reported in this thesis is an investigation of the teaching and learning of area measurement in the early years of school. Research indicates that children confuse the measurement of area and perimeter and also the use of linear and two-dimensional units of measure. The first phase of the study investigated the knowledge and skills which underpin an understanding of the L x B formula for calculating rectangular area. Those factors were used to plan a teaching program of four lessons for Year 1 and Year 2 children, focusing on: establishing the attribute of area; making, describing and drawing the spatial structure of arrays of repeated informal units to measure areas; and methods of counting to determine the total number of units. The effectiveness of the program was evaluated by implementing the lessons in four classes. Lessons planned from the then current syllabus were implemented in another four classes. Comparison of student learning outcomes from all classes indicated that the research lessons were more effective in assisting children to develop an understanding of a grid pattern or array of repeated informal units. The second phase of this study described the researcher&#8217;s investigation, design and trial of teacher professional learning strategies which would assist teachers to adopt successful methods of teaching young children to measure area. Seventeen volunteer teachers in seven school teams participated in one of three models of professional learning, based on varying levels of consultancy support. The models were based on the provision of lesson notes and teaching materials, facilitation of team meetings to discuss the implementation, and the provision of additional time to interview individual children following each lesson. Participation in the project assisted all of the participating teachers to develop their content knowledge and to modify their teacher-centred teaching practices. The key strategies and factors which contributed to this success included ongoing school based professional dialogue and support, the provision of a teaching program which emphasised students&#8217; conceptual development within a sequence of activities, the role played by teacher leaders within each team, opportunities to develop questioning techniques and the motivation and disposition of the participating teachers.ABSTRACT</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">area measurement</field><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="subject">mensuration</field><field name="subject">length measurement</field><field name="subject">study and teaching (primary)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/27435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Portfolios : narratives for learning: assessment processes and phenomenon across multiple environments</field><field name="creator">Woodward, Helen Lynette</field><field name="description">This document is a portfolio about portfolios and a narrative about narratives. It is a meta-portfolio and a meta-narrative. It breaks new ground by providing a conceptual framework that supports assessment processes and phenomena across multiple environments. It is a portfolio, a narrative for learning. The fundamental premises initially established in this study are constantly revisited throughout the document. These premises focus acutely on the value and worth of the portfolio authors as they negotiate their learning and develop their understandings of assessment and reflection. As the study encounters new environment it investigates the parallels between the established methodologies of assessment and equates them with the new situation. Research, literature and practice support these methodologies. Investigations into the constructs of narrative process and phenomenon led to the development of a conceptual framework that was synonymous with portfolio process and phenomenon across pre-service teacher education, primary school education and teacher professional development. Alignment of this framework with the Doctorate of Education portfolio showed a further equivalence. As well as the possibilities of the framework being useful in the development of portfolios in different environments the symbiotic nature of narratives and portfolios has subsequently shown that learning is not only demonstrated by the evidence in the portfolio but that learning occurs in the telling of the story: in the presentation of the portfolio.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">portfolios in education</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">college-school cooperation</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">training of</field><field name="subject">college students</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="subject">rating of</field><field name="subject">educational tests and measurements</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/27518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The reproductive biology of four Banksia L. f. species with contrasting life histories</field><field name="creator">Renshaw, Adrian</field><field name="description">In this thesis, aspects of the reproductive biology of four Banksia species that display in various combinations all the life histories currently recognised in the genus were compared. Species like banksias, from fire prone regions of the world are typically characterised by life histories (traits and organs) that in reference to fire response allow them to be classified as seeders or sprouters. Plants killed by fire and that rely on seed for regeneration are called seeders and those that have the capacity to survive fire and produce vegetative sprouts are called sprouters. The species are Banksia ericifolia, Banksia integrifolia, Banksia oblongifolia, and Banksia serrata. The study was conducted in the Sydney region of Australia, which was arbitrarily divided into North, Central, and Southern provinces for sampling across species. It has been generally hypothesised that several traits are likely to be associated with seeders and sprouters. However, these traits were not always clearly apparent from the author&#8217;s studies. It is argued one reason for the anomalies in the expected associated traits is a result of a tendency to assume a evolutionary history that is based on fire as being the primary selection pressure.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Banksia</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sydney (N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">effect of fires on</field><field name="subject">plants</field><field name="subject">reproduction</field><field name="subject">effect of fires on</field><field name="subject">plant ecology</field><field name="subject">plant ecophysiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/28075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responses of nectarines to atmospheres containing high carbon dioxide concentrations</field><field name="creator">Uthairatanakij, Apiradee</field><field name="description">Nectarines suffer low temperature disorders (LTD)when stored for more than 2 - 3 weeks at temperatures below 8 degrees C.

The initial aim of this research was to explore the genetic basis of the differences among cultivars in the responses to high CO2.After much investigation, it was shown that both genetic and seasonal factors are involved in the development of LTD in nectarines. The development of LTD is a form of chilling injury since they only occur at temperatures below 8 degrees C. but there was no evidence of of a direct role for ethylene in either causing or delaying LTD. It was proposed that storage at low temperatures causes a metabolic imbalance resulting from changes in the amounts or activities of proteins associated with normal ripening.

The methodology of the lived experience of the author is drawn upon for a legal and spiritual analysis of cases lived by the author, which provide a backdrop to the handing back of certain Aboriginal lands in Tasmania as well as reflecting on the intersection of Aboriginal lore and the legal system. The meaning of these cases goes beyond a rational legal analysis as the idea that genocide is still continuing is a difficult one for Australians to understand due to compartmentalisation between spirituality and the law in the context of modern Australia. The High Court case of Mabo poses a dilemma for Aborigines as it contains an opportunity to move beyond terra nullius thinking, but at the same time it limits claims in a way that continues dispossession and may in certain circumstances disallow aspects of Aboriginal self determination. Within this apparent standoff lies the possibility for a development of the law that can embrace or incorporate the Aboriginal spiritual attachment to the land, ancestors and artefacts. There is no word in the English language that can describe the multifaceted, inside and outside, perspectives required to carry out the required discussion that could bring the law more into tune with the people, the land and the original inhabitants. The spiritual direction of Australia, however, could be affected by the turning away from a material, logical rational perspective to the embracing of connection as a value in itself: to spiritual values and a personal sense of calling. The Sacred wound is the meditation around which the discussion of all these themes of lived experience, the law and spirituality moves and ultimately rests.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Tasmanians</field><field name="subject">social life and customs</field><field name="subject">legal status, laws etc.</field><field name="subject">race discrimination</field><field name="subject">Tasmania</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/28158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Screenwriting : an experience of a writing genre</field><field name="creator">Funk, Grace H.</field><field name="description">This dissertation explores screenwriting as a writing genre. Accompanying the dissertation, in a separate binding, is my feature film screenplay, Jungles of Sandakan, a spec script, written with the speculation of selling for production. The screenplay represents an experience of writing. From the writer&#8217;s position, the dissertation articulates a feminine voice, reflective of the writer who experiences the writing of the feature film script, rather than being an expos&#233; on gender, or feminist-specific issues regarding the experience. As such, it is one kind of research. Nonetheless, the research attempts to explore the complexities of writing in relation to the problems that exist in the film world that prevent, or annihilate, and yet enable and require, the very experience of writing. Screenplays are the lifeblood of the picture business, writes Paul Lazarus, in Working In Film; The Marketplace in the &#8216;90s. Lazarus, a film producer and observer of the American film industry, paints the script as the endemic life force of the film business. Without the script, it is implied, there is no film production. This gives an impression of privilege in relation to the script, and writing. In the grand scheme of things in the picture business though, this is not the case, as anxieties about the script often render writing inconsequential in the context of film production, thus reducing the script&#8217;s privilege and placing its significance in uncertain terrain, quite often to the point of oblivion. The writer is often voiceless, and often expected, or required, by the production hierarchy, to remain impartial to her work, or relinquish ownership of her work altogether. For an industry that seemingly depends initially on writing for its own existence, the anxieties displayed towards the script, even though it is merely the blueprint of a film production, as well as the writer, appear very problematic The fiction/drama screenplay, as a storytelling device, has fundamental significance pertaining to history, national identity, issues of gender, sexuality, race relations, social, cultural and political dynamics, views and representations of self and of other(s), ethnicity, religion, multiculturalism and so on, a plethora of issues that inform the writing, the script, as represented by characters, and story.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motion pictures</field><field name="subject">vocational guidance</field><field name="subject">motion picture authorship</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/28254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surviving severe interpersonal trauma : an examination of hope</field><field name="creator">Cameron, Ian R.</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the ways in which a number of individuals survived their experiences of severe and perpetrated trauma. I theorise the participant&#8217;s survival adaptations in terms of hope which I positioned as being an active relational process. A case study method was used to collect data from intersubjective-psychoanalytically informed therapy sessions, from three participants who each received 12, 60 minute therapy sessions. I utilised a hermeneutic ontology from the work of Gadamer, who contended that the development of understanding and meanings results from an active intersubjective process. This ontology and design enabled the research to capture and interpret aspects of the dynamic development of personal meanings about the experiences of surviving traumas. Central to my notions of hope is the concept of intersubjectivity which is based upon the work of Winnicott, Fairbairn, Ferenczi, Meares, Stern and Bromberg. Using their ideas about relatedness and identification I argue that survivors expressed hopeful intentions and actions through their conscious and unconscious adaptive strategies. I explore the peritraumatic hopeful adaptations the survivors made such as identifying with the aggressor, the splitting of self, and the overt valuing of relatedness. I further argue that hopeful intentions can be seen in such actions as the survivor remembering their trauma rather than re-enacting it, in their efforts in narrating their trauma histories despite their fears, shame and difficulties in finding a listener. The thesis concludes by exploring some of the ramifications for society of hope, trauma and witnessing: foremost being the need to recognise the vulnerable in our communities and the difficulties we face in meeting the challenges of knowing their stories.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">post-traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">psychotherapy</field><field name="subject">psychic trauma</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/28296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Second nature : artifice and history in film</field><field name="creator">Finnane, Gabrielle</field><field name="description">The thesis comprises a screen play for a one hour film and dissertation examining artistic issues in the intersection of biography and history in fictional films. The aim was firstly to broaden the definition of what is involved in filming historical fictions, in terms of how both characters and historical settings are conceived. Secondly the work explores the artifice of historical representation on the screen through case studies of films which are experiments in filming history and biography. Thirdly both the screenplay and the dissertation consider the implication of fictions which deal with minor historical figures. Primarily the thesis elucidates conceptions of historical artiface in the cinema advanced by films themselves, films which had either a paradigmatic or an idiosyncratic role in the development of certain artistic practices. Films, like works of written fiction, have in many respects invented new meanings for, and associations with, the past. The thesis concludes that the different conceptions of historical artiface embodied in fictional films have implications for our sense of the past.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">historical films</field><field name="subject">motion pictures and history</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/28326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semi-detached</field><field name="creator">Hawryluk, Lynda J.</field><field name="description">This collection of short stories is about being a twenty-something in the 90s, trying to get by, have a little fun and make somewhat of a mark in the process. It&#8217;s about the process of growing up, and the seemingly desperate need to hold onto all those youthful pursuits. It&#8217;s about finding out that life as an adult tries to suck the life out of you, rather than allowing you to suck the life out of it. That constant struggle, the battle of wills between attending to your needs or just satisfying your wants. This is a time for you when your needs and wants are siblings, bickering in the back of the car on a long drive up the coast. The characters in these stories are having their good time while it lasts. Avoiding the inevitable: maturity, responsibility, adulthood. And so they should. After all, these aren&#8217;t called &#8216;the best years of our lives&#8217; for nothing.

Sexuality and death are then related through pleasurable attachment and painful severance. Next they are discussed in terms of Georges Bataille's notions of continuity and discontinuity. Secondly, The Garden of Eden is looked at as a mythological indicator of the psychological links between sexuality and death. Sexual differentiation has a role to play as woman is seen to be a signifier of death through the writings of Julia Kristeva and Victor Burgin. Thirdly, Plato's argument for immortality is discussed, specifically through The Phaedo. The argument centres on the separation of self from sexual pleasure in order to defeat death. Fourthly, the chastity of Mary and Christ is dealt with. It can be seen to be resultant of the tight connection between sexuality and death and relevant to a hope for immortality. For Christian theology there exists a necessary division for those who are immortal from their own earthly carnality. Fifthly, Julia Kristeva's notion of Abjection is looked at through her essay, Powers of Horror. Abjection plays a significant role in the attempt at repression of the sexual drive and the death drive. Lastly, the reflection of Narcissus is observed. There seems a human need for a reflection self that goes beyond notions of delusionistic beauty or reviling horror. Sexuality and death are accepted as most essential aspects of our being. Abjection leads to a rejection then an acceptance of our own perishing carnality.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">art and society</field><field name="subject">sex in art</field><field name="subject">death in art</field><field name="subject">immorality in art</field><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/28421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social attractors : an examination of the applicability of complexity theory to social and organisational analysis</field><field name="creator">Goldspink, Chris</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I demonstrate that the theory and practice of contemporary institution forming, in community, business, administration and governance, are dominated by approaches that prevent us finding that which is now most urgently sought. This is an understanding of the endogenous origins and nature of social change and innovation, and the means by which it can be managed. I point directly at an alternative, provide an exposition of its potential and implications, both theoretical and applied, and propose a conceptual framework for its further application and extension. Methodologies appropriate to such a theory will include both simulation and qualitative research, in particular situated narrative. For the former, agent based simulation is most appropriate. For the latter, a 'naturalistic inquiry' method is most appropriate as it best highlights the importance of keeping track of phenomenal domain from which situations are being interpreted and explained. These combined techniques make possible a rigorous development of social theory denied where the extremes of positivism or relativism are embraced along the dimensions of the existing modernist/post-modernist divide. Agent based computational theory and method is currently dominated by cognitive and representationalist models. These are inconsistent with the assumptions necessary to bring to the fore the implications of complexity for social analysis. One of the most important contributions of this work is the development of a theory of agency consistent with that required if sources of order other than deliberate action in a boundedly rational decision space are to be considered. This is essential if the full import of complexity for understanding social dynamics is to be explored. This theory of agency takes the form of a social meta-model as a guide to future development and research. The work concludes with a brief exposition of a research program needed to advance the ideas presented.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organizational sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/28452</field></doc><doc><field name="title">One child, two languages : bilingual first language acquisition in Japanese and English</field><field name="creator">Itani-Adams, Yuki</field><field name="description">This is the first Japanese-English Bilingual First Language Acquisition (BFLA) longitudinal study carried out within the framework of Processability Theory (PT) (Pienemann, 1998a). The informant of this study is Hannah, who was raised in Australia in a one-parent one-language environment from birth. Hannah&#8217;s speech production in each language was collected in a language-specific setting with different interlocutors (i.e., Japanese with the Japanese-speaking mother and English with the English-speaking father), from the time she was 1; 11 (one year and eleven months) until she was 4;10. This study investigates Hannah&#8217;s lexical development, the acquisition of morphology and syntax in the two languages. Unlike previous studies in bilingual children&#8217;s lexicon (Deuchar and Quay, 2000), this study focuses on the composition of the lexicon in each language to test for language-specific developmental patterns (Gentner and Boroditsky, 2001).The study also compares the development of these two languages in terms of MLU, lexical, morphological and syntactic development. Furthermore, the study examines the relationships between lexical and grammatical development within each of the two languages and tests the Critical Mass Hypothesis (Marchman and Bates, 1994) in a bilingual context. One of the central issues in the field of BFLA, identified by scholars such as DeHouwer (2005) and Meisel (1990a), is to characterise the relationship between the two developing languages of one child. Does a bilingual child initially develop the two languages as one linguistic system that later separates into two as expounded by Volterra and Taeschner (1978), or does a bilingual child develop the two languages separately from the beginning, as represented by De Houwer&#8217;s (1990) Separate Development Hypothesis (SDH)? Previous BFLA studies addressing this issue (e.g., De Houwer, 1990; Meisel, 1990a; Mishina, 1997; Paradis and Genesee, 1996) did not have a common point of reference to compare the development of two different languages directly. In the present study, PT provides a common point of reference for a direct comparison of the development of two typologically distant languages. Results indicate that both Japanese and English of the child developed in the sequence predicted by PT. They also support the SDH for lexical development, the acquisition of morphology and word order. The study confirms the Critical Mass Hypothesis in bilingual context. The results from the present study suggest that, for one bilingual child, Japanese and English each developed in parallel but in a separate manner.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">bilingualism in children</field><field name="subject">language acquisition</field><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">Japanese language</field><field name="subject">acquisition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/28484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the aetiopathogenesis of type I autoimmune diabetes</field><field name="creator">Al-Domi, Hayder A.</field><field name="description">It is well recognised that every disease has both genetic and environmental causes. There are indications that environmental factors may play a crucial role over a limited period of time in genetically susceptible individuals to initiate the pancreatic insulin producing beta-cells autoimmune process. No causal links between environmental triggering factors and the pancreatic autoimmune process have yet been identified unequivocally. Although the occurrence of autoimmune diabetes in Jordan is increasing by approximately one percent annually, studies on diabetes in young Jordanian children remain limited. Therefore, the rationale of this study hinges upon establishing a base-line dietary profile, and determining possible humoral and secretory immune response to native and heat processed bovine serum albumin modified with bovine insulin in young Jordanian children with diabetes. To minimise the increasing occurrence of the disease through proposing safe and inexpensive preventative interventions of the disease, this study is directed at improving the understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of the disease by participating in identifying potential primary environmental triggering factors.

Some major themes examined include organisation, capital, regionalism, patriotism, nationalism, amateurism, professionalism, and social class. The thesis is a chronological study of the period between 1876 and 1927. It examines the fortunes of the world and national champions and the various organisational methods used to sustain the sport as a national symbol and mass spectacle. In the analysis of the sport&#8217;s post-war fortunes, specific focus is given to the sport&#8217;s prolonged apathy towards organisational and structural concerns, how imperialism and self-interest came to dominate the sport and why professional sculling lost its meaning and significance within a progressive and increasingly erudite society. Among the many findings of this thesis, the traditional belief that gambling and corruption destroyed professional sculling is refuted. The failure of the sport to endure and prosper was of its own making, as it failed to adapt to the increasingly sophisticated organisational demands, institutionalisation and commodification of twentieth-century society.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rowing</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/28936</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A soil microbial response to urban wastewater application : bacterial communities and soil salinity</field><field name="creator">Aiken, Jane Tracy</field><field name="description">Soils research at the University of Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Campus, was undertaken to investigate bacterial communities and soil salinity in an applied study.

Results indicated that relative abundance distributions for candidate forms of the bacteria community associated with higher and lower salinity, as defined using canonical correlation analysis, were reproducible between laboratory incubation experiments and field samples.

The focus of the examination is the construction of Major Thomas Mitchell&#8217;s line of road between Mt. Victoria and Bathurst in the 1830&#8217;s. Specifically the thesis documents the various sites on the line of road with a particular emphasis on the administrative centre and principal facility, No. 2 Stockade Cox&#8217;s River, to explain the dynamic interaction of the network and its role in the penal repertoire of New South Wales. In bringing together a large range of sources the thesis has enabled the first thorough reading of the convict sites associated with the Western road. This has led to a multi-dimensional understanding of the place, its people, and the process of its construction.

As a result, several explanations have been suggested to explain the expansion of the size of the public economy and a large amount of literature has been produced. In the late 19th century, the German economist Adolph Wagner predicted that economic development would be accompanied by a relative growth in the public sector. This thesis argues that the way the Wagner Hypothesis has been interpreted in the existing literature has been incomplete both on theoretical and empirical grounds. Data shows that the independent variable is an important determinant of the growth of government share in income. This result is generally consistent with the WH and lends support to the logistic and the Gompertz processes of government growth. Following discussion, the principal conclusion is that the rise of the share of government expenditure in income in the cross section sample of 88 countries can be partly explained by the changes in the levels of real GDP per capita for those countries.

Typically, the performance of any stock market is reflected through stock market prices. It would not be over emphasizing to state that, now the stock market is shedding value, it is having a tremendous influence in shaping the overall economies of most developed nations around the globe. Two research questions from the perspective of the Australian stock market have been developed for empirical examination.The questions are: (i) what systematic risk factors are influential for the Australian stock market returns in both the long-and short-runs; and (ii) is the Australian stock market linked to developed stock markets under the influence of globalization? The methodological approaches suitable for empirical analyses have been closely investigated to reveal the precise characteristics of the long-run stock market pricing process.Empirical tests have been performed to ascertain whether the Australian stock market is responsive to the a priori variables, and if so, which ones and to what extent. Cointegration techniques have been applied to help answer both research questions. To answer the second research question, an analysis has been performed that examined six overseas developed stock markets and asked whether the Australian stock market is cointegrated with those markets in the long-run. The results of the first study show that only a few systematic risk factors are responsible for Australian stock market price movements in the long-run while short-run dynamics are in force. The results of the second study confirm that the Australian stock market is being influenced by a small number of overseas markets and it is integrated with those markets under the influence of globalization.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">securities</field><field name="subject">prices</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">risk assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/30117</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tamil minority problem in Sri Lanka in the light of self-determination and sovereignty of states</field><field name="creator">Samarasinghe, Ruwan P.</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the Tamil minority problem in Sri Lanka in the light of self-determination and state sovereignty.

Some of the overall reasons why Greeks believe Australia is not the lucky country include racism, qualifications were not initially recognised, and Greece is now perceived as being economically superior to Australia. Some of the main limitations of the present study include : the small number of subjects recruited, advertisement design, ambiguous definition of the lucky country, and the study was only concentrated in one geographical section of Sydney. Recommendations are included to assist future researchers alleviate some of the problem areas.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Greeks</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">migrants</field><field name="subject">social integration</field><field name="subject">Greece</field><field name="subject">emigration and immigration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/29120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stringybark summer</field><field name="creator">Barnet, Sophie</field><field name="description">The first section of this paper examines the formation and portrayal of female/lesbian identity within Australian Literature with particular reference to the Bush Mythology tradition of the 1800's. Through reviewing a number of works classed as lesbian fiction it is argued that a more positive portrayal of lesbian love within Australian fiction is needed. To facilitate this shift in attitude traditional literary motifs, such as the journey and the bush, (typically the preserve of male characters) can be appropriated by a female hero. In the process of re-imagining the bushman's journey as one undertaken by a female/lesbian hero, the bush emerges as a force that can facilitate the hero on her journey toward a sense of wholeness. In keeping with the tradition of Feminist, Lesbian and Heroic literature Stringybark Summer charts the increasing self awareness of a young Australian lesbian as she journeys into the bush. The third person narrative follows the protagonist as she embarks on a journey into the unknown in order to discover the deeper meaning about her self, the world and those who share it with her.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian fiction</field><field name="subject">19th century</field><field name="subject">lesbians in literature</field><field name="subject">lesbians</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/29146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stripping potentiometric determination of trace metals in environmental materials</field><field name="creator">Sahara, Emmy</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development and application of stripping potentiometric methods for reliable determination of some trace metals in natural waters on a glassy carbon mercury film electrode (GCMFE). The development of these methods involved investigation of factors influencing the stripping potentiometric measurement, such as selection of adequate supporting electrolyte, choice of pH and/or concentration of supporting electrolyte, oxidant concentration, deposition potential, deposition time, stirring or sample rotation rate and equilibrium period. Moreover, the influence of complexing agents and the magnitude of constant current were carefully investigated for adsorptive cathodic stripping potentiometric methods. In addition, linear concentration range and detection limits were considered. The analytical application of the method to some natural waters was also demonstrated. It is concluded that the stripping potentiometric methods developed in this study are adequate for ultra-trace determination of copper, lead, cadmium, zinc, nickel and molybdenum. The methods provide very simple procedures, excellent precision and accuracy for the reliable determination of the six metals in natural water samples.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">potentiometry</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="subject">electronic measurements</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/29143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Texted love : a social-semiotic examination of greeting cards</field><field name="creator">Hobson, Jane Claire</field><field name="description">This thesis surveys patterns of production and use of greeting cards in Australia and analyses a corpus of greeting cards, examining the organisation of semiosis by greeting cards.As a commodity consumed for the express purpose of being given away, individuals using greeting cards enact themselves through a commodified technology of the self simultaneous with a performance that enacts relations with others.Particular focus is given to the 'fun-and- love' card, within the industry category of non-occasion greeting cards. This type of card is situated within a complex of performances which are constitutive of a contemporary nexus of commodification, public-private spheres, gender, interpersonal relations and discources of intimacy.As this is an inquiry into a commodity that is a texted cultural artefact, it is informed by both cultural and textual theories. The organisation of the thesis into two parts reflects its twin concerns: the first is akin to a study of the greeting card as a commodity that is given away, paying attention to practices of production, consumption and use within personal relationships. In symmetry with that exploration, Part Two is contiguous with the 'linguistic turn' that has taken many disciplines in productive directions over the duration of the twentieth century.In doing both these kinds of 'discourse analysis' articulated to an empirico-ethnographic study of a cultural artefact that embodies emotion, the thesis seeks to contribute to dialogues that are concerned with moving forward with respect to theorising relations among sociocultural practices and language and discourse.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">greeting cards</field><field name="subject">interpersonal communication</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/30315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design flood estimation for ungauged catchments in Victoria : ordinary and generalised least squares methods compared</field><field name="creator">Haddad, Khaled</field><field name="description">Design flood estimation in small to medium sized ungauged catchments is frequently required in hydrologic analysis and design and is of notable economic significance. For this task Australian Rainfall and Runoff (ARR) 1987, the National Guideline for Design Flow Estimation, recommends the Probabilistic Rational Method (PRM) for general use in South- East Australia. However, there have been recent developments that indicated significant potential to provide more meaningful and accurate design flood estimation in small to medium sized ungauged catchments. These include the L moments based index flood method and a range of quantile regression techniques. This thesis focuses on the quantile regression techniques and compares two methods: ordinary least squares (OLS) and generalised least squares (GLS) based regression techniques. It also makes comparison with the currently recommended Probabilistic Rational Method. The OLS model is used by hydrologists to estimate the parameters of regional hydrological models. However, more recent studies have indicated that the parameter estimates are usually unstable and that the OLS procedure often violates the assumption of homoskedasticity. The GLS based regression procedure accounts for the varying sampling error, correlation between concurrent flows, correlations between the residuals and the fitted quantiles and model error in the regional model, thus one would expect more accurate flood quantile estimation by this method. This thesis uses data from 133 catchments in the state of Victoria to develop prediction equations involving readily obtainable catchment characteristics data. The GLS regression procedure is explored further by carrying out a 4-stage generalised least squares analysis where the development of the prediction equations is based on relating hydrological statistics such as mean flows, standard deviations, skewness and flow quantiles to catchment characteristics. This study also presents the validation of the two techniques by carrying out a split-sample validation on a set of independent test catchments. The PRM is also tested by deriving an updated PRM technique with the new data set and carrying out a split sample validation on the test catchments. The results show that GLS based regression provides more accurate design flood estimates than the OLS regression procedure and the PRM. Based on the average variance of prediction, standard error of estimate, traditional statistics and new statistics, rankings and the median relative error values, the GLS method provided more accurate flood frequency estimates especially for the smaller catchments in the range of 1-300 km2. The predictive ability of the GLS model is also evident in the regression coefficient values when comparing with the OLS method. However, the performance of the PRM method, particularly for the larger catchments appears to be satisfactory as well.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flood forecasting</field><field name="subject">flood control</field><field name="subject">floods</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">statistical methods</field><field name="subject">regression analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/30369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and development of acquisition, control and processing software for two dimensional high performance liquid chromatography</field><field name="creator">Toups, Erich P.</field><field name="description">In modern chemical laboratories, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has become the technique of choice amongst separation scientists as evidenced by the huge body of published literature that employ the technique as the pre-eminent analytical method. Increasingly analytical chemists are seeking to determine the chemical signature (or fingerprint) of complex and perhaps even simple samples. The analysis of environmental samples, natural products, such as essential oils, the evaluation of illicit drugs, or the quality assurance of pharmaceuticals are just four areas where chemical fingerprinting may be important. The chemical classification of these types of mixtures can be undertaken using chromatographic methods of analysis coupled with detection processes that provide identification ie. mass spectroscopy (MS), infrared spectroscopy (IR), atomic spectroscopy (ICP) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). While these techniques find widespread use and their applications are growing at a rapid rate, their limitations as routine applications for determining chemical signatures, is limited by the initial purchase price and the high associated running costs; especially for hyphenated liquid chromatographic systems. In general, a high degree of operator expertise is also required to ensure correct operation and interpretation of the results. While complete chemical specification may be undertaken by using multiple hyphenated methods, none of the above mentioned techniques provide for a rapid means of detection on a routine or continuous mode of operation. This can limit their application. However, an alternative to monitor and evaluate the chemical signature of complex samples is to employ multidimensional separations. In the expanded multidimensional separation space the probability that two species will elute with exactly the same retention time in both separation dimensions decreases compared to the one-dimensional separation. This probability further decreases as the separation mechanisms become more divergent and the two-dimensional separation space is maximised. Hence, the uniqueness of a two-dimensional retention time increases and thereby the multidimensional separation approach becomes a means of chemical fingerprinting. Hence 2D-HPLC technique is a powerful and less expensive method of separation compared to hyphenated techniques. This thesis describes the development of a stand-alone 2D-HPLC system for the separation of complex samples. A comprehensive 2D-HPLC software package has been developed for data acquisition, hardware control, data processing and graphical presentation. Two data acquisition hardware modules have also been developed. These hardware and software modules have been integrated with existing equipment in our laboratory. The performance of this newly developed 2D-HPLC system has been successfully evaluated. All these details have been described in the five chapters of this thesis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high performance liquid chromatography</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="subject">automation</field><field name="subject">information storage and retrieval systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/30399</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Framing a portrait of the artist : evolution in design</field><field name="creator">McLaren, Stephen</field><field name="description">This research attempts to reframe our understanding of James Joyce&#8217;s first novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, in the light of Joyce&#8217;s theme of the artistic process, and in relation to the evidence of Joyce&#8217;s own artistic development. The reframing work is based on three operations: firstly, examining Joyce&#8217;s development in the light of related texts: Joyce&#8217;s early critical writings and antetextes. We trace Joyce&#8217;s intellectual and imaginative growth, both prior to the original &#8220;inception&#8221; point of Portrait in 1904, and from that time up to the point where, the original draft of the novel (Stephen Hero) having been abandoned, Joyce recast Portrait, in September 1907. The growth of Joyce&#8217;s ideas about art, creativity and the social responsibility of the artist, into a rich literary chronotope is examined. Secondly we re-examine the new historical concepts of intention and a work&#8217;s inception, from a Bakhtinianian perspective: theories of intention, the prosaic imagination and chronotope. The concept of &#8220;design&#8221; is explored, to encompass the purposive principles, intentions and form of the evolving novel. Thirdly, a reading of Portrait in relation to its chronotopic framing is advanced, using Bakhtin&#8217;s concept of &#8220;dialogic creative understanding&#8221;. Portrait is read as the story of the soul of a developing artist who comes, through a series of phases, to an understanding of his vocation in respect of three key chronotopic orientations: a social sense of responsibility; the importance of creativity in the highest service of art; the harnessing of the &#8220;plastic powers&#8221; of the artist imbued with a deeply rooted but dialogical sense of history.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Joyce, James, 1882-1941</field><field name="subject">Portrait of the artist as a young man</field><field name="subject">Bakhtin, M.

Typically, the performance of any stock market is reflected through stock market prices. It would not be over emphasizing to state that, now the stock market is shedding value, it is having a tremendous influence in shaping the overall economies of most developed nations around the globe. Two research questions from the perspective of the Australian stock market have been developed for empirical examination.The questions are: (i) what systematic risk factors are influential for the Australian stock market returns in both the long-and short-runs; and (ii) is the Australian stock market linked to developed stock markets under the influence of globalization? The methodological approaches suitable for empirical analyses have been closely investigated to reveal the precise characteristics of the long-run stock market pricing process.Empirical tests have been performed to ascertain whether the Australian stock market is responsive to the a priori variables, and if so, which ones and to what extent. Cointegration techniques have been applied to help answer both research questions. To answer the second research question, an analysis has been performed that examined six overseas developed stock markets and asked whether the Australian stock market is cointegrated with those markets in the long-run. The results of the first study show that only a few systematic risk factors are responsible for Australian stock market price movements in the long-run while short-run dynamics are in force. The results of the second study confirm that the Australian stock market is being influenced by a small number of overseas markets and it is integrated with those markets under the influence of globalization.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">securities</field><field name="subject">prices</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">risk assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/30640</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The torch collector</field><field name="creator">Kucharova, Sue</field><field name="description">The Torch Collector is a Magical Realist novel set in Sydney.

However, a number of researchers working on its periphery have contributed commentary and judgements to a discourse on it that has existed since the establishment of the Sydney Turf Club (STC) in 1943. Their writings have created an orthodox view of the sport that suggests inter alia it was a cultural expression of a &#8216;needy and greedy&#8217; element of the working class and that its constituency was excluded from that of the racing of the Establishment, conducted by the Australian Jockey Club (AJC). This orthodoxy also holds unregistered racing was subject to endemic corruption, haphazardly conducted, inexpensive to attend, provided poor money and was in general a burlesque of AJC racing. The thesis engages this discourse and tests the tenets of the orthodoxy through examination or re-examination of relevant primary sources, including parliamentary papers, contemporary newspapers and journals, race books and other documents, administrative records, photographs, and the memoirs and transcripts of oral history provided by human participants.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pony racing</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sydney (N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">horse racing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/30867</field></doc><doc><field name="title">test</field><field name="creator">test, test</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tuberculosis: Prospects for an Oral Vaccine Using Novel Antigens and Adjuvants</field><field name="creator">Hitchick, Nola</field><field name="description">In spite of vaccine and treatment strategies, Mycobacterium tuberculosis kills more than 3 people per minute. The emergence of drug-resistant strains makes treating the disease complicated and expensive for government health departments, and unpleasant and laborious for patients. The current vaccine, parenterally administered BCG, is only 50% effective. Oral vaccination has the advantage of targeting the mucosal immune system, which acts at the direct site of initial exposure to the infecting airborne pathogen. In addition, oral vaccines are cheaper and safer to administer than parenteral vaccines. This dissertation provides a conceptual framework for the prevention of the disease by means of oral vaccination and outlines methods that were developed for the production of concentrated purified somatic and extracellular antigens. Immune responses to somatic antigens were also examined in conjunction with established and novel adjuvants.

Spatial clustering is fundamental and central to geographical data mining. It partitions a dataset into smaller homogeneous groups due to spatial proximity. Resulting groups represent geographically interesting patterns of concentrations for which further investigations should be undertaken to find possible causal factors.  In this thesis, we propose a spatial-dominant generalization approach that mines multivariate causal associations among geographical data layers using clustering analysis. First, we propose a generic framework of multi-purpose exploratory spatial clustering in the form of the Template-Method Pattern. Based on an object-oriented framework, we design and implement an automatic multi-purpose exploratory spatial clustering tool. The first instance of this framework uses the Delaunay diagram as an underlying proximity graph. Our spatial clustering incorporates the peculiar characteristics of spatial data that make space special. Thus, our method is able to identify high-quality spatial clusters including clusters of arbitrary shapes, clusters of heterogeneous densities, clusters of different sizes, closely located high-density clusters, clusters connected by multiple chains, sparse clusters near to high-density clusters and clusters containing clusters within O(n log n) time. It derives values for parameters from data and thus maximizes user-friendliness. Therefore, our approach minimizes user-oriented bias and constraints that hinder exploratory data analysis and geographical data mining.  Sheer volume of spatial data stored in spatial databases is not the only concern. The heterogeneity of datasets is a common issue in data-rich environments, but left open by exploratory tools. Our spatial clustering extends to the Minkowski metric in the absence or presence of obstacles to deal with situations where interactions between spatial objects are not adequately modeled by the Euclidean distance. The genericity is such that our clustering methodology extends to various spatial proximity graphs beyond the default Delaunay diagram. We also investigate an extension of our clustering to higher-dimensional datasets that robustly identify higher-dimensional clusters within O(n log n) time. The versatility of our clustering is further illustrated with its deployment to multi-level clustering. We develop a multi-level clustering method that reveals hierarchical structures hidden in complex datasets within O(n log n) time. We also introduce weighted dendrograms to effectively visualize the cluster hierarchies.  Interpretability and usability of clustering results are of great importance. We propose an automatic pattern spotter that reveals high level description of clusters. We develop an effective and efficient cluster polygonization process towards mining causal associations. It automatically approximates shapes of clusters and robustly reveals asymmetric causal associations among data layers. Since it does not require domain-specific concept hierarchies, its applicability is enhanced.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geographical data mining</field><field name="subject">clustering</field><field name="subject">spatial data mining</field><field name="subject">association rules mining</field><field name="subject">post-clustering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/25012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young East Timorese in Australia: Becoming Part of a New Culture and the Impact of Refugee Experiences on Identity and Belonging</field><field name="creator">Askland, Hedda Haugen</field><field name="description">In 1975 Indonesian forces invaded Dili, the capital of East Timor.

This study considers the situation of a particular group of East Timorese refugees: those who fled to Australia during the 1990s and who were children or young adolescents at the time of their flight.	Founded upon an understanding of social identity as being constantly transformed though a dialectic relation between the individual and his or her sociocultural surroundings, this dissertation considers the consequences of refugee experiences on individual identity and belonging, as well as the processes of conceptualising self and negotiating identity within changing social and cultural structures. The relationship between conflict and flight, resettlement, acculturation, identity and attachment is explored, and particular attention is given to issues of socialisation and categorisation, age and agency, hybridity, and ambiguity.  Through a qualitative anthropological methodology informed by theories of cultural identity, adolescence and cross-cultural socialisation, the thesis seeks to shed light on the various dynamics that have influenced the young East Timorese people&#8217;s identity and sense of belonging, and considers the impact of acculturation and socialisation into a new culture at a critical period of the young people&#8217;s lives.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">East Timor</field><field name="subject">young people</field><field name="subject">uncertainty and temporariness</field><field name="subject">resettlement</field><field name="subject">acculturation</field><field name="subject">socialisation</field><field name="subject">cultural discourse</field><field name="subject">hybridity</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">sense of belonging</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/25016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Berlioz and Virgil: The Relationship Between Les Troyens and the Aeneid</field><field name="creator">Ewans, Jenifer Joy</field><field name="description">Berlioz based the libretto of his five&#8212;act Grand Opera Les Troyens on books II, the second half of I, and IV of the Aeneid of Virgil, and set it to music which illuminates his vision of Virgil&#8217;s epic poem. This thesis compares the story patterns, narrative techniques, themes and content of the two works. Because Virgil uses the technique of retrospective narrative in Book II of the Aeneid, and Berlioz unfolds his story in chronological order, I have used the sequence of Berlioz&#8217;s work as the basis for the comparison. The thesis analyses in detail Berlioz&#8217;s re&#8212;use of Virgil, the points where Berlioz&#8217;s treatment coincides with Virgil&#8217;s, the points where he diverges from Virgil, arid the main thrust of Berlioz&#8217;s argument. The two most important differences which emerge between the two works are the divergent ideas on the gods, and on the conflict between personal love and duty. Whereas pietas and filial duty are central to Virgil&#8217;s work, the importance of love between man and woman is central to that of Berlioz. And in Les Troyens the terrific tension between love and duty is illuminated in Act V, where Aeneas must leave Dido even though Berlioz has shown in Act I, with Cassandra and Coroebus, that, fate permitting, such a love can be duty as well. Virgil shows us the gods at work, and carefully attempts to explain their motivation. Berlioz however structures his music&#8212;drama so that the gods, only one of whom (Mercury) makes an appearance, are shown to be cruel by their complete indifference to those who invoke them.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Berlioz</field><field name="subject">Virgil</field><field name="subject">Les Troyens</field><field name="subject">Aenid</field><field name="subject">gods</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24938</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance Practice Issues in Russian Piano Music</field><field name="creator">Smith, Gregory Michael</field><field name="description">The nineteenth and twentieth centuries witnessed the rapid growth of musical culture in Russia. This resulted in a large repertoire of piano music &#8212; ranging from miniatures to virtuosic etudes and sonatas. Growing out of the nineteenth century romantic tradition, and highly influenced by the social conditions of the time, Russian composers developed a distinctive style which closely reflected their culture, personalities and ideologies. There are several approaches to studying performance practice. One is to study the interpretations of other pianists. While this does have many advantages, it has not been adopted in this paper as it has one flaw: it still fails to capture the distinctive language of these composers. Rather, the paper will study the social and musical influences on the composers, and, more importantly, their philosophies about pianism and the purpose of music. This will be related to interpretative issues in the works. The repertoire has been divided into four areas. The paper commences with a study of the miniature, which is valuable in finding the &#8216;essence&#8217; of a composer&#8217;s musical language expressed on a small scale. Here, the &#8216;elementary&#8217; considerations in performance practice will be studied. The second chapter discusses etudes. This is useful in gaining an insight into composers&#8217; conception of technique, and how this relates to performance practice. The third chapter deals with music that has extra-musical themes. This provides opportunity for a more detailed cultural and biographical study of the composers. To represent the large-scale repertoire of Russian composers, the sonata will be studied.

IVR is a telephone interviewing technique where the human speaker is replaced by a high quality recorded interactive script to which the respondent provides answers by pressing the keys of a touch-telephone (touchphone). IVR has numerous advantages, including: economy, autonomy, confidentiality,  access to certain population groups, improved data quality, standardised interviewing,  multi-lingual interfaces, and detailed longitudinal assessments. Despite this, there have been few survey applications of IVR compared to alternative methods such as Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI). There has not been any evaluation of the use of IVR for asking sensitive questions in surveys or as a tool for health promotion at the community level. A literature review, described in Chapter 2, was conducted to identify other methods of asking sensitive questions. The literature review identified 19 different methods. Those methods that were most successful were those that provided the greatest degree of anonymity to the respondent. It was suggested that IVR may be a suitable method for community surveys. As described in Chapter 3, a custom software called Generalized Electronic Interviewing System (GEIS) was developed. This provided both CATI and IVR interviewing modes. As described in Chapter 4, it was found that the response rate obtained using IVR was unacceptably low, and an alternative interviewing method, the Hybrid method was developed. In the Hybrid method the interview was initiated by the interviewer but completed using IVR with GEIS. As described in Chapter 5, the IVR, CATI and Hybrid methods were used to investigate self-reported rates of alcohol and drug consumption within a telephone household survey of 2880 households. The self-report rates were compared to the National Drug Strategy Household Survey (NDSHS). Response rates did not differ significantly between the CATI and Hybrid methods, however the response rate for IVR was significantly less than the other methods. The Hybrid and IVR methods obtained significantly higher self-report consumption rates for alcohol and marijuana, and significantly higher hazardous drinking scores using Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). In Chapter 6 a pilot of an IVR cervical screening brief advice interface is described. A total of 5000 households were contacted by the IVR system. The system randomly selected an eligible woman aged 18-69 per household and determined her cervical screening status. A total of 661 women listened to the IVR message. The IVR call was shown to be acceptable and inexpensive compared to a mail pamphlet intervention. In Chapter 7 a randomized controlled trial of an IVR cervical screening brief advice involving 17,008 households is described. Cervical screening rate data were obtained from the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) for a period spanning six months before and following the intervention. The cervical screening rate was increased in the intervention postcodes by 0.43% compared to the control postcodes, and the increase was greater for older women at 1.34%. This was a desirable outcome since this group is considered to be an at-risk group. The overall conclusion was that IVR technology could be feasibly used to contact women to deliver brief interventions aimed at increasing cervical screening rates, but the cost per screen was likely to be high. It is suggested that an IVR system could be linked to cervical screening registers to more directly and economically contact women, and provide an efficacious complementary approach to the existing letter reminder system.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IVR</field><field name="subject">Interactive Voice Response</field><field name="subject">CATI</field><field name="subject">Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing</field><field name="subject">Sensitive Questions</field><field name="subject">Cervical Cancer</field><field name="subject">Alcohol</field><field name="subject">Drugs</field><field name="subject">Brief Interventions</field><field name="subject">Hybrid method</field><field name="subject">GEIS</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/25025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sampled-data models for linear and nonlinear systems</field><field name="creator">Yuz Eissmann, Juan Ignacio</field><field name="description">Continuous-time systems are usually modelled by differential equations arising from physical laws. However, the use of these models in practice requires discretisation. In this thesis we consider sampled-data models for linear and nonlinear systems. We study some of the issues involved in the sampling process, such as the accuracy of the sampled-data models, the artifacts produced by the particular sampling scheme, and the relations to the underlying continuous-time system. We review, extend and present new results, making extensive use of the delta operator which allows a clearer connection between a sampled-data model and the underlying continuous-time system. In the first part of the thesis we consider sampled-data models for linear systems. In this case exact discrete-time representations can be obtained. These models depend, not only on the continuous-time system, but also on the artifacts involved in the sampling process, namely, the sample and hold devices. In particular, these devices play a key role in determining the sampling zeros of the discrete-time model. We consider robustness issues associated with the use of discrete-time models for continuous-time system identification from sampled data. We show that, by using restricted bandwidth frequency domain maximum likelihood estimation, the identification results are robust to (possible) under-modelling due to the sampling process. Sampled-data models provide a powerful tool also for continuous-time optimal control problems, where the presence of constraints can make the explicit solution impossible to find. We show how this solution can be arbitrarily approximated by an associated sampled-data problem using fast sampling rates. We also show that there is a natural convergence of the singular structure of the optimal control problem from discrete- to continuous-time, as the sampling period goes to zero. In Part II we consider sampled-data models for nonlinear systems. In this case we can only obtain approximate sampled-data models. These discrete-time models are simple and accurate in a well defined sense. For deterministic systems, an insightful observation is that the proposed model contains sampling zero dynamics. Moreover, these correspond to the same dynamics associated with the asymptotic sampling zeros in the linear case. The topics and results presented in the thesis are believed to give important insights into the use of sampled-data models to represent linear and nonlinear continuous-time systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sampled-data models</field><field name="subject">nonlinear systems</field><field name="subject">optimal control</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical Modelling of Entrained Flow Coal Gasification</field><field name="creator">Beath, Andrew Charles</field><field name="description">A mathematical model for entrained flow coal gasification was developed with the objective of predicting the influence of coal properties and gasification conditions on the performance of entrained flow gasifiers operating at pressures up to 21 atmospheres (2.1MPa). The model represents gasifiers as plug flow reactors and therefore neglects any mixing or turbulence effects. Coal properties were predicted through use of correlations from a variety of literature sources and others that were developed from experimental data in the literature. A sensitivity analysis of the model indicated that errors in the calculated values of coal volatile yield, carbon dioxide gasification reactivity and steam gasification may significantly affect the model predictions. Similarly errors in the input values for gasifier wall temperatures and gasifier diameter, when affected by slagging, can cause model prediction errors. Model predictions were compared with experimental gasification results for a range of atmospheric and high pressure gasifiers, the majority of the results being obtained by CSIRO at atmospheric pressure for a range of coals. Predictions were accurate for the majority of atmospheric pressure results over a large range of gas feed mixtures. Due to the limited range of experimental data available for high pressure gasification the capability of the model is somewhat uncertain, although the model provided accurate predictions for the majority of the available results. The model was also used to predict the trends in particle reactions with gasification and the influence of pressure, gasifier diameter and feed coal on gasifier performance. Further research on coal volatile yields, gasification reactivities and gas properties at high temperatures and pressures was recommended to improve the accuracy of model inputs. Additional predictions and model accuracy improvements could be made by extending the model to include fluid dynamics and slag layer modelling.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">entrained flow coal gasification</field><field name="subject">coal properties</field><field name="subject">gasifiers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24844</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dissociating Automatic and Intentional Processes in Children&#8217;s Eyewitness Suggestibility</field><field name="creator">Holliday, Robyn Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The chief aim of this dissertation was to establish the respective contributions of automatic and intentional memory processes to misinformation effects in 5-, 8-, and 9-year-old children.  In the first two experiments children were presented with a picture story followed by misleading post-event details that were either read to participants, or were self-generated in response to semantic and perceptual hints.  Children were then presented with original and suggested items and given a yes / no recognition test under inclusion or exclusion instructions.  The application of Jacoby&#8217;s (1991) process dissociation procedure to children&#8217;s recognition performance revealed that the contribution of intentional processing to misinformation acceptance increased following the self-generation of suggestions.  Automatic processing made a strong contribution to misinformation effects regardless of the way that misinformation was encoded.  Experiment 3 extended this general pattern of results to a forced choice recognition paradigm.  Experiment 4 examined the role of social demand factors in children&#8217;s suggestibility using Belli&#8217;s (1989) yes / no retrieval paradigm.  Little evidence of an influence of social demand on children&#8217;s suggestible responses was found with automatic processes again the predominant factor determining suggestibility.  In the final experiment, the temporal order of the original and post-event phases was reversed such that 5-year-olds were initially presented with a post-event summary containing misinformation, followed by a witnessed event.  The results of this study confirmed that children&#8217;s suggestions were unlikely to be the result of trace alteration or social demand.  The implications of the findings for theoretical accounts of the misinformation effect in children&#8217;s recognition and for children&#8217;s eyewitness testimony are discussed.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">memory processes</field><field name="subject">process dissociation</field><field name="subject">intentional memory processes</field><field name="subject">automatic memory processes</field><field name="subject">suggestibility</field><field name="subject">eyewitness testimony</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/25005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A collective case study: How regular teachers provide inclusive education for severely and profoundly deaf students in regular schools in rural New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Cameron, Jill</field><field name="description">This thesis reports a collective case study of the school educational experiences of five severely and profoundly deaf students who were enrolled in regular schools in rural areas of New South Wales. The students ranged in age from 6 to 18 years. Three issues were examined: (1) The impact of the philosophy of inclusive education and the question of why students with high degrees of deafness and high support needs were enrolled in regular schools in rural areas; (2) The specific linguistic an educational support needs of deaf students; and (3) The ability of the regular schools and teachers to cater for the educational needs of the deaf students in those settings. The case studies revealed that to considerably varying extents in different situations, the students were afforded inclusive educational opportunities. The extent of inclusiveness of students&#8217; educational experiences was shown to vary according to a number of variables. The variables identified included: the type and quality of communication with the deaf student, teaching style, accessibility of content, particular lesson type, and the type and extent of curriculum adaptations employed. As a result of the analysis of the data from the five cases, a number of generalistions were possible. These generalisations were that (a) students with the ability to access spoken communication auditorily were more easily included than students using manual communication; (b) reduction of linguistic and academic input occurred as a response to student inability to access class programs because of reduced linguistic capabilities, resulting in the deaf students receiving different and reduced information to the hearing students; (c) communication between a deaf student and his or her class teacher needed to be direct for the most successful inclusion to occur; (d) teaching style needed to be interactive or experiential for successful language learning and literacy development to occur; (e) curriculum adaptations needed to involve provision of visual support for lesson material to be highly effective; (f) lessons/subjects easily supported by visual means, such as mathematics or practical subjects, when taught hierarchically, going from the known to unknown in achievable steps, meant teaching style could be either transmission or interactive, for lesson activities to be considered inclusive; (g) students with poor literacy skills were unable to successfully access an intact (i.e., unaltered and complete) high school curriculum; (h) the teaching style of the class teacher impacted on the support model possible for the itinerant teacher; (i) an interactive class teaching style allowed for cooperative teaching between class teacher and itinerant teacher who could then assist the class teacher with both the linguistic and academic needs of the deaf student; (j) a transmission style of teaching resulted in various levels of withdrawal for the deaf student unless the subject matter could be represented visually; (k) when curriculum content or expected outcomes were reduced, the deaf students did not have the same access to information as their hearing counterparts and consequently could not develop concepts or understandings in the same manner; and (l) language and literacy development were most facilitated when interactive teaching opportunities were established proactively for the deaf students rather than through the reduction of content as a response to their failure to successfully engage with the complete curriculum. The conclusions suggest an alternative support proposal for deaf students in rural environments. The model of support proposed involves the targeting of specific preschools and primary schools with the provision of teachers identified to teach collaboratively and interactively. Under the proposed model several students with impaired hearing would be located within the one school with the itinerant teacher position becoming a full-time appointment in that school. Such a model would enable coenrolment, co-teaching, co-programming, creative grouping, and the provision of demonstration opportunities and support for other teachers within the school and district that had deaf students enrolled. Finally, interactive teaching, based on a clearly defined theoretical model of language acquisition, development, and learning, is recommended for students with impaired hearing in such environments. It is argued that the support of linguistic development and academic learning could be facilitated concurrently, thus ensuring that by the time students had reached high school they would possess sufficient literacy skills to access a regular high school program successfully.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">qualitative research</field><field name="subject">issues</field><field name="subject">special education</field><field name="subject">integration</field><field name="subject">International legislation</field><field name="subject">Regular Education Initiative</field><field name="subject">anti-discrimination legislation</field><field name="subject">theories of language acquisition</field><field name="subject">visual and auditory languages</field><field name="subject">auditory aids</field><field name="subject">visual aids</field><field name="subject">interpreting</field><field name="subject">literacy learning</field><field name="subject">residential segregated schools</field><field name="subject">itinerant teachers</field><field name="subject">teaching styles</field><field name="subject">differentiation</field><field name="subject">co-enrolment</field><field name="subject">adhocratic solutions</field><field name="subject">discourse types</field><field name="subject">Iniation Response Evaluation</field><field name="subject">validation techniques</field><field name="subject">classroom observation</field><field name="subject">semi-structured interviews</field><field name="subject">interactive learning</field><field name="subject">support modes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24990</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recycling Multicast ATM Switches</field><field name="creator">Hall, Daniel Francis</field><field name="description">The majority of ATM switches that have been proposed only support unicast (point-to-point) connections. Those supporting multicast (point-to-multipoint) connections tend to perform poorly, with acceptable multicast performance only achievable using an excessive amount of hardware. Because of the growing importance of multicast traffic, there is the demand for multicast switch designs which offer both low hardware complexity and high performance. This research investigates a class of multicast ATM switches called recycling switches which can satisfy both requirements. Recycling switch performance is studied using a simulated network model. The major performance parameters measured are the loss rate, mean delay, and delay variance of cells crossing through the switch under uniform and bursty traffic patterns. The reason recycling is not more widely used in multicast switches is the perception that it can lead to some multicast cells receiving lower quality of service than others. This research demonstrates a new priority-based approach to designing recycling multicast ATM switches which addresses this problem while maintaining low complexity and excellent scalability.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ATM</field><field name="subject">asynchronous transfer mode</field><field name="subject">multicast</field><field name="subject">switch</field><field name="subject">recycling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24986</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autarkeia and Aristotle's Politics: The Question of the Ancient Social Formation.</field><field name="creator">Morpeth, Neil Anthony</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the idea of the rise of the moral political economy.

This thesis is particularly concerned with evaluating natural resource management actions. Integrated evaluation tools may assist in weighing up multi-dimensional pros and cons of each management action. These tools aid decision making in two main ways; helping a decision maker to clarify his or her thoughts and suggesting preferable management options. Many integrated evaluation tools produce a ranking of options, from most to least preferred, in order to guide the choice of a management option. They achieve this by integrating impact assessment data, on how well management options perform economically, socially and environmentally, with a decision maker&#8217;s value judgements. Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods for example, often ask the user to specify what weight of importance each impact category should have in the appraisal of management options. If the impact data is in time series, a decision maker may be asked to consider how important future impacts are in comparison to short term impacts. The economic method of discounting future impacts is regularly utilised to aggregate a time-series of impact data. This thesis looks beyond weighting and discounting, and explores tools which may better formalise value judgements about: balancing economic, social and environmental outcomes and; intergenerational equity. Such tools may be more effective in helping a decision maker to clarify his or her thoughts and in suggesting appropriate courses of action. A water resource case study is utilised to illustrate some of the alternatives identified. A major contribution of this thesis is a new integrated evaluation method referred to as Target Ordering. The Target Ordering method was developed in order to better identify which performance outcomes are most important to stakeholders and ensure user control of tradeoffs between impact categories, while retaining simplicity. This method is based on value judgements about how important target outcomes are, rather than how important the impact categories themselves are. That is, it is an alternative to weighting methods. The Target Ordering method is also extended to allow an aggregation of data across multiple time frames. That is, to provide an alternative to discounting. There seems to be a dearth of studies comparing how effective integrated evaluation tools are for helping users to think through and articulate their own preferences and to learn about the preferences of others. This thesis draws on existing research and presents new research, such that the effectiveness of weighting and non-weighting methods on these dimensions may be examined. Two experiments were conducted where a small number of water industry professionals utilised weighting and non-weighting tools to rank a large number of water management options. The non-weighting methods include Target Ordering and a graphical tool for facilitating an intuitive evaluation of management options. These tools are respectively classified as aspirational and holistic evaluation methods. Feedback was obtained from the participants through both surveys and interviews. The survey results indicate that the Target Ordering tool was significantly more useful than weighting methods for helping participants to articulate and apply their values to the problem. In general the Target Ordering tool was easier to utilise and was said to be more intuitive by some participants. The graphical tool was found to outperform a simple weighting method in facilitating users to think through and articulate their value judgements. No differences in usefulness of the graphical method and the Target Ordering method were found. Further experimental research is needed to compare how effective weighting, aspirational and holistic methods are in facilitating learning and communication of preferences in the decision making process.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">option appraisal</field><field name="subject">planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Significance of Staff Decision Making and Awareness in Acquired Brain Injury Outreach Contexts</field><field name="creator">Snead, Suzanne Leigh</field><field name="description">Staff who work in front line, direct contact support positions with community based clients with acquired brain injuries (ABI) hold unique responsibilities, and face unique challenges in their work due to the combination of three key factors: autonomous work environments, socially sanctioned power status over clients, and the decision making deficits of clients with ABI. These factors further contribute challenges to staff in the presently complex and ambiguous outreach context, where the embedded ideologies of the medical model of treatment remain in tension with the purported ideologies of the social model of disability and client self determination that drive outreach services. Using constructivist grounded theory methods and narrative and interpretive analysis strategies, this research interviewed fifteen (15) ABI outreach support workers to explore and examine their perceptions of the outreach context, how they negotiate decision spaces, and how they deal with the central ethical dilemma of outreach - achieving balance between their duty of care and the client's dignity of risk. The thesis documents decision making strategies used by the interview participants, examines the factors that influence their decision space when in the field with clients, and explores the role staff awareness of professional and personal values plays in making decisions in the best of interest of the client. Staff awareness is shown to be a critical, yet oft neglected factor in consideration of staff ethical decision making in ABI outreach.

The author shares the view of scholars who propose that an innate knowledge base underlying first language acquisition does not extend to second language acquisition due to the lack of uniform success in the acquisition of native speaker competence, the possibility of fossilisation and the facilitative potential of form-focused instruction.  It is, thus, assumed that the sequential second language acquisition process can be accounted for by general learning mechanisms.  The key to these learning mechanisms is, firstly, the investigation of the nature of the knowledge underlying the grammatical encoding procedures for speech production in the context of M. Pienemann&#8217;s (1998a) Processability Theory and, secondly, the investigation of the nature of its acquisition process. Pienemann&#8217;s Processability Theory explains and predicts the sequential acquisition process of a second language as the result of the hierarchically ordered development of the processing procedures of the grammatical processor to grammatically encode conceptual information.  It shares with Levelt&#8217;s (1989) theory of speech production the assumptions concerning the nature of the knowledge underlying the grammatical encoding procedures, which require further investigations for verification.  Since the Processability Theory does not specify how the assumed knowledge underlying grammatical encoding is acquired, an investigation of the nature of its acquisition process is necessary. This investigation highlights the interdependence between the nature of the knowledge to be acquired and the nature of its acquisition process by demonstrating that the knowledge underlying grammatical encoding is predominantly implicit and, consequently, determines the implicit nature of its acquisition process.  Such implicit knowledge is dissociated from explicit knowledge, which determines the explicit nature of its acquisition process.  This investigation also demonstrates that explicit grammar teaching and practice in the context of the manipulation of the learners&#8217; attentional orientation mediated by alertness may contribute to the implicit learning process under certain conditions. In conjunction with the provision of guidance by the Processability Theory in regard to the achievement of instructional focus and the independent finding that comprehensible input is needed in order for second language acquisition to occur, these results constitute the basis for the formulation of detailed instructional measures for the effective organisation of the sequential second language acquisition process. These measures are exemplified by their implementation for the initial stages of the acquisition of German as a second language.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">speech production</field><field name="subject">interlanguage</field><field name="subject">processability</field><field name="subject">psycholinguistics</field><field name="subject">German language acquisition</field><field name="subject">teaching and learning processes</field><field name="subject">grammatical encoding</field><field name="subject">implicit and explicit knowledge bases</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Bed Maker&#8217;s Model: A Thematic Study of Louis I.

The current study considers Kahn&#8217;s post-1960 concept of &#8220;form&#8221;, as espoused in his 1961 article, &#8220;Form and Design&#8221;, in relation to Plato&#8217;s theory of Forms, as that theory is presented in The Republic. A deeper appreciation of Kahn&#8217;s text is achieved through an examination of the hypothesis that the word &#8220;form&#8221;, as it is defined in Kahn&#8217;s article, is congruous with Plato&#8217;s famous concept, whereby Forms are said to be independent of humans and particulars. This leads to a related hypothesis, that Kahn&#8217;s shift in emphasis towards transcendent types is reflected in his development of what could be called Platonising architectural strategies, because they reflect parallel aims between Plato and Kahn. While Kahn and Plato are quite different figures, separated by time, profession and intentions, consideration of Plato&#8217;s treatment of the Forms in The Republic illuminates a new interpretation of &#8220;Form and Design&#8221; and the building which is most closely associated with that text, Kahn&#8217;s First Unitarian Church and School in Rochester. The thesis identifies ideas within Kahn&#8217;s text which resonate with Plato&#8217;s philosophy, suggesting that Kahn&#8217;s theory can be interpreted through notions stemming from the early moments of the Western philosophical tradition. It also identifies inconsistencies between Kahn&#8217;s text and Plato&#8217;s and between various statements made by Kahn, highlighting the fact that Kahn&#8217;s philosophical musings are not those of a trained philosopher.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">Louis Kahn</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">Plato</field><field name="subject">Form</field><field name="subject">typology</field><field name="subject">Modernism</field><field name="subject">First Unitarian Church Rochester</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24826</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community-Based Evidence about the Health Care System in Rural Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Tuan, Tran</field><field name="description">Thesis Summary COMMUNITY-BASED EVIDENCE ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN RURAL VIETNAM   This thesis contributes further evidence for policy-making on health care system reform in Vietnam.  The author aims to provide insights into the provincial rural health system ten years after health sector reform was launched, through assessing availability of health care services, patterns of access of health care services when people are ill, and the costs of care and the performance of public and private providers. The following questions are addressed:  1.	Which health care providers, i.e., public or private, are dominant in providing curative services to rural people when they are ill? 2.	How much inequality exists between the poor and the non-poor in access to health care services in general, and public health care services in particular, when they are ill? Which factors explain the gap in use of services between the poor and the non-poor? 3.	What policy and strategies should Vietnam consider implementing in order to reach the goals of better equity and quality of care for rural populations?  These research questions were addressed using community-based survey data collected in 2001 from Hung Yen province, in which three components of the system -- user, provider, and community context -- are described and linked together in analysis. In addition, a supplementary health care provider survey collected in 1999 in three other provinces (Thai Binh, Binh Thuan, An Giang) is used to provide evidence about the availability of healthcare services in general and of private health care providers.  The thesis is divided into two parts with a total of 9 chapters. Part A (chapters 1-4) provides  background for the research questions raised about the commune health care system in rural Vietnam, the framework used in evaluating this health care system, and the data sources used in this thesis. Part B consists of five chapters (chapters 5-9) that presents research results on various dimensions of the rural health care system. It also provides conclusions on the health care system in rural Vietnam, and proposes policies and strategies for strengthening this system toward equity and efficiency. Chapter 1 presents the research rationale and objectives. It examine the international context of health sytem research, the Vietnamese context of health sector reform since  the ?Doi Moi?, and the current trend of health sector reform, and the previous research done so far related to health system reform in Vietnam. The research questions addressed by the thesis are presented at the end of this chapter. Chapter 2 describes the historical development of rural health care system in Vietnam. It startes with an overview of social changes in the  rural Vietnam including revolution and wars and both the positive and negative impacts on the health of rural populations. The evolution of the rural health care system is then outlined, from the single national provider system (public) to the reforms of 1989 where a public-private model for rural health care was introduced.  Chapter 3 provides frameworks for analysis of availability, health accessibility, quality and efficiency of the rural health care system, and inequality of healthcare service utilization. It starts with a statement about the concept of health care system used in this thesis. Then five theoretical models for assessing the health care systems (health service utilization model, triangular model, model for improve quality of care, health care services as an open system, and the World Bank?s framework for assessing the performance of the health sector in serving the poor) are presented. The strategy of using these frameworks to assess the rural health system in Vietnam is explained. The link between the research questions and methodology used was described. Chapter 4 provides detailed descriptions of the two data sources and analysis strategies used to address the thesis research questions. The design and data collection methods of the health care provider surveys and household surveys in the four provinces are presented, followed by the specific strategy of using information from each database for the thesis objectives. The chapter ends with a presentation of the overall strategy of data analysis. Chapter 5 assesses availability of the commune health care system in rural areas of Vietnam with empirical data from all the four provinces. The findings show that both public and private health care providers are available in rural Vietnam, with a slight dominance of private services. There were commune health centers (CHCs) in all communes with at least one private physician in the majority of the communes. The average number of private providers ranged from 2.7 to 7.7 per 10,000 population in the four provinces. Many of them practiced without formal registration and under limited government supervision.  Chapter 6 estimates perceived need of care by measuring the burden of non-fatal health problems with data from 3,498 people of 900 households randomly selected in Hung Yen province. Compared to the better off, the poor suffered significantly more long-term health ailments (an excess of 78 cases per thousand population) and more short-term morbidity (an excess of 112 cases per thousand population). The study found that the gap in household wealth index contributed approximately 55% of the explained gap in prevalence of long-term health conditions, equivalent to the gap of 60 cases per thousand population, and also 55% of the explained gap in short-term morbidity, equivalent to the gap of 38 cases per thousand population between the two groups based on the Oaxaca decomposition (D=0). Gaps in education, gender, health insurance, and occupation played a minor role in explaining the wealth-related inequalities in non-fatal health burden. Chapter 7 describes patterns of use of health care services when people are ill by type of providers, by type of illnesses, and by poverty ranking level. Findings in this chapter reveal a high level of self-medication, greater access to private than public services, and less use of public services or any health care services by the poor in comparison to the better off. Self-funded purchases of drugs for self-medication and use of private curative services were even common in those with health insurance.  A single private provider contact for treatment of illness costs on average 2.6% of the total annual expenditure per capita, and self-medication with drugs purchased at private health care facilities costs 1.0% of total annual expenditure per capita, similarly these at district hospitals and commune heath centers were similar. Finally, the percentage of ill people with no access to any health care providers during their illness episode was high, regardless of their wealth or health insurance status. Chapter 8 compares the quality of private and public health services using a framework proposed by the World Bank for evaluating the quality of health care in developing countries. Results from this chapter show that technical quality of care was poorer in the private sector than among public providers while costs for patients were similar in private and public facilities, and client satisfaction was similar in public and private facilities. Chapter 9 summarizes the results from Chapters 5-8 to identify the main characteristics of the rural health system with a view to system sustainability and proposes policies and strategies for strengthening the quality of the public health care sector and improving its equity and efficiency. The main features of the current rural health care system in Vietnam identified from the community-based evidence found in this research are: (1) primary health care services are available and there is equality in physical access; (2) financial resources for the CHC system are diversified with Government resources the key contributors; (3) private health care providers for outpatient services, public providers for inpatient services; (4) quality of treatment services is below the national standard; (5) public services are available but under utilized; (6) the rural health care system is not a pro-poor system; (7) direct payment is the main component of total health care expenditure; and (8) the economic relationship of the rural health care system is a user-provider model rather than a health care triangular model. Nine recommendations to strengthen the rural health care system were then developed based on a critical view  of the objectives of the Vietnam health sector reform for the period 2001-2010 supported by evidence found in this research. This chapter ends with a section to remind readers about the limitations of this study and then proposes future research with specific questions covering three main dimensions of health care system reform in Vietnam (accessibility, quality of care, and overall management). A study with a sentinel site approach to follow-up the impact of the social and health sector reform policies is also proposed to help the government make timely adjustments to their policies to protect the poor.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health care system</field><field name="subject">rural Vietnam</field><field name="subject">community-based evidence</field><field name="subject">primary health care services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender Dynamics in an Engineering Classroom: Engineering Students&#8217; Perspectives</field><field name="creator">Burrowes, Gunilla Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This research is an exploratory study into gender dynamics in an engineering classroom in a Faculty of Engineering at an Australian University. It has concentrated on understanding and presenting students perceptions of their learning environment in an engineering classroom and their experiences within it to determine the extent to which gender affects different classroom experiences.  A first year engineering subject &#8216;Introduction to Engineering Computing&#8217; was the environment used for this study. The research employed an ethnographic research methodology drawing on semi-structured interviews and observations. It also used surveys to triangulate the data for improved reliability and validity.  Gender has clearly been highlighted as a determinant of students&#8217; experiences from a students&#8217; perspective in an engineering classroom. The most noticeable differences between female and male student experiences found in this study stemmed from four factors: their previous experiences; their learning approaches; the language used within the classroom and the lack of role models.  In these areas there were found to be various levels of advantage and disadvantage experienced by women and men. These are presented in Chapter 5 &amp; 6 of this thesis. The resulting understanding begins the process of providing a framework in which strategies can be developed to more effectively engage female and male students in engineering education.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering Education</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Classroom Experiences</field><field name="subject">Student Experiences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Broadcasting Policy in Australia: Political Influences and the Federal Goverment's Role in the Establishment and Development of Public/Community Broadcasting in Australia - A History 1939 to 1992</field><field name="creator">Thornley, Phoebe Neva</field><field name="description">Utilizing published and unpublished sources and working with interviews of a number of participants this thesis examines the evolution of the political influences that stimulated the Australian federal government's policy decisions on public broadcasting.  The background to the federal government's original involvement in broadcasting in the early years of the twentieth century is investigated to put later developments into a broader perspective.  Comparisons are also drawn with progress in other comparable Western countries to highlight the unique nature of the Australian model.  Since broadcasting was never an issue, like health and education, which could capture votes from the electorate as a whole, government policy was driven by pressure from particular special interest groups as their influence waxed and waned and calls from individual electorates, when the interest was strong and the seat was marginal.  The government decisions that resulted from this situation were ad hoc and expedient and no really coherent policy was ever implemented.  This thesis examines the forces that led to the restriction in the expansion of broadcasting services after World War 2 and to the change in the influence of pressure groups in the 1960s which led to the establishment of FM and public broadcasting in the 1970s.  A detailed exploration of particular interests, such as the Public Broadcasting Association of Australia, educational broadcasters and ethnic broadcasters shows how the influence of different groups changed over time.  Once public broadcasting was established the main concern of both broadcasters and government was to keep the sector economically viable.  A detailed analysis is provided of how the funding arrangements altered as the sector grew.  There were always some idealists who saw public broadcasting as a vehicle for putting forward their own point of view.  But, this thesis concludes that, by the early 1990s, apart from its role as regulator, which was the same for commercial broadcasting, government policy on public broadcasting was largely driven by the fact that minimal funding for the sector enabled government to ensure that essential non-commercially viable broadcasting services that would be far more expensive for the government to provide itself, were able to continue.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">political influences</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">broadcasting</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">community broadcasting</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24917</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical Thinking And Mathematics Achievement Of Students In The Year 11 Scientific Stream In Jordan</field><field name="creator">Mubark, Ma&#8217;Moon Mohammad</field><field name="description">The first aim of this study was to identify important aspects of mathematical thinking, and to investigate the relationships between the different aspects of mathematical thinking and mathematics achievement. The second aim was to examine possible gender and school location (urban, suburban, and rural) differences related to aspects of mathematical thinking and mathematics achievement.  Two assessments were developed that were suitable for students in the Year 11 scientific stream in Jordan. One test was for aspects of mathematical thinking and the other for mathematics achievement, the latter being consistent with typical school achievement tests for these students in Jordan. The researcher chose and developed items to test mathematical thinking and mathematics achievement from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), the internet, research literature, specialist books in mathematics and his own experience.  The data were collected in the 2003-2004 academic year from over 500 Year 11 scientific stream students (both male and female) at 20 randomly selected schools from six directorates in the Irbid Governorate, Jordan. In addition, 13 teachers were individually interviewed, and four groups of students were interviewed in focus groups to obtain information about their opinions and about different methods of thinking in mathematics. The teacher interviews were used to identify consistencies and inconsistencies between the test results and the respondents&#8217; opinions of difficulty and importance. In addition, information was obtained about the classroom time teachers devoted to the different aspects of mathematical thinking and the teaching strategies they employed.  Six aspects of mathematical thinking were identified by the study: Generalization, Induction, Deduction, Use of Symbols, Logical thinking and Mathematical proof. Mathematical proof was also the most difficult aspect, while Logical thinking was the least difficult. Female students had significantly higher mean scores than males on three of the six aspects of mathematical thinking and on the total test scores. Students attending suburban schools had significantly higher mean scores than students at urban and rural schools on four aspects, and on the total scores. Using multiple regression analysis, all six aspects were found to be important for mathematics achievement. Mathematical proof and Generalization were the most important aspects, Use of symbols and Logical thinking were next in importance, and Deduction and Induction were the least important aspects. Approximately 70 per cent of the variance in mathematics achievement was explained by the six aspects of mathematical thinking, gender, and school location.  There was a high level of consistency between teacher opinions of the relative importance of aspects of mathematical thinking and the test results. However, there were some nconsistencies between the teacher opinions and test results with respect to relative difficulty levels of the six aspects.  By clarifying the importance for mathematics achievement of the six aspects of mathematical thinking identified, this study has relevance for the teaching of mathematics to Year 11, scientific stream students in Jordan.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematical thinking</field><field name="subject">mathematics achievement</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">school location differences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24864</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rational and Heron Tetrahedra</field><field name="creator">Chisholm, Catherine Rachel</field><field name="description">Rational tetrahedra are tetrahedra with rational edges. Heron tetrahedra are tetrahedra with integer edges, integer faces areas and integer volume --- the three-dimensional analogue of Heron triangles. Of course, if a rational tetrahedron has rational face areas and volume then it is easy to scale it up to get a Heron tetrahedron. So we also use `Heron tetrahedra' when we mean tetrahedra with rational edges, areas and volume. The work in this thesis is motivated by Buchholz's paper {\it Perfect Pyramids} [4]. Buchholz examined certain configurations of rational tetrahedra, looking first for tetrahedra with rational volume, and then for Heron tetrahedra. Buchholz left some of the cases he examined unsolved and Chapter 2 is largely devoted to the resolution of these. In Chapters 3 and 4 we expand upon some of Buchholz's results to find infinite families of Heron tetrahedra corresponding to rational points on certain elliptic curves. In Chapters 5 and 6 we blend the ideas of Buchholz in [4] and of Buchholz and MacDougall in [7], and consider rational tetrahedra with edges in arithmetic (AP) or geometric (GP) progression. It turns out that there are no Heron AP or GP tetrahedra, but AP tetrahedra can have rational volume. They can also have one rational face area, although only one AP tetrahedron has been found with a rational face area and rational volume. For GP tetrahedra there are still unsolved cases, but we show that if GP tetrahedra with rational volume exist, then there are only finitely many. The faces of a rational GP tetrahedron are never rational. Much of the work in these two chapters also appeared in the author's Honours thesis, but has been refined and extended here, and is included to give a more complete picture of the work on Heron tetrahedra which has been done to date. In the final chapter we use a different approach and concentrate on the face areas first, instead of the volume. To make it easier (hopefully) to find tetrahedra with all faces having rational area, we place restrictions on the types of faces and number of different faces the tetrahedra have.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">heron tetrahedra</field><field name="subject">rational tetrahedra</field><field name="subject">diophantine equations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling Long-Term Persistence in Hydrological Time Series</field><field name="creator">Thyer, Mark Andrew</field><field name="description">The hidden state Markov (HSM) model is introduced as a new conceptual framework for modelling long-term persistence in hydrological time series. Unlike the stochastic models currently used, the conceptual basis of the HSM model can be related to the physical processes that influence long-term hydrological time series in the Australian climatic regime. A Bayesian approach was used for model calibration. This enabled rigourous evaluation of parameter uncertainty, which proved crucial for the interpretation of the results. Applying the single site HSM model to rainfall data from selected Australian capital cities provided some revealing insights. In eastern Australia, where there is a significant influence from the tropical Pacific weather systems, the results showed a weak wet and medium dry state persistence was likely to exist. In southern Australia the results were inconclusive. However, they suggested a weak wet and strong dry persistence structure may exist, possibly due to the infrequent incursion of tropical weather systems in southern Australia. This led to the postulate that the tropical weather systems are the primary cause of two-state long-term persistence. The single and multi-site HSM model results for the Warragamba catchment rainfall data supported this hypothesis. A strong two-state persistence structure was likely to exist in the rainfall regime of this important water supply catchment. In contrast, the single and multi-site results for the Williams River catchment rainfall data were inconsistent. This illustrates further work is required to understand the application of the HSM model. Comparisons with the lag-one autoregressive [AR(1)] model showed that it was not able to reproduce the same long-term persistence as the HSM model. However, with record lengths typical of real data the difference between the two approaches was not statistically significant. Nevertheless, it was concluded that the HSM model provides a conceptually richer framework than the AR(1) model.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Long-term persistence</field><field name="subject">Hidden state Markov model</field><field name="subject">Australian rainfall</field><field name="subject">El Nino</field><field name="subject">Markov chain Monte Carlo methods</field><field name="subject">Gibbs sampler</field><field name="subject">Parameter uncertainty</field><field name="subject">AR(1) model</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24891</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paediatrics in New South Wales, 1945 TO 1965</field><field name="creator">Evans, Robert George</field><field name="description">Paediatrics became a viable medical specialty in Australia and New South Wales between 1945 and 1965. Paediatricians took possession of occupational spaces previously claimed by other medical groups and created their own new spaces. They argued that children were still growing and differed physically and emotionally from adults. Their special needs warranted the formation of a new division in medicine. Paediatricians adopted the new knowledge, technology and therapeutics that became available in the post-war period and demonstrated that they were capable of following the scientific medicine paradigm, the prevailing standard in internal medicine. Access to the children's hospital was essential for paediatricians as a workshop for their professional development, to treat their seriously ill patients, to support their claims for occupational space and for their authority and status as specialists in medicine.. Scientific medicine demanded more of the time of the paediatricians and in RAHC they elected to continue working in an honorary capacity. In another children's hospital, RCH in Melbourne, paediatricians were employed in a version of the full-time system. The different approaches to staffing illustrate the conflicts of interest found in specialty development in Australia and the pervasive influence of medico-political issues. As members of a privileged autonomous profession paediatricians in RAHC owed a duty to the people of NSW, and in their honorary positions, to the hospital.  They had responsibilities to their patients, both private and public. They were committed to their own professional development and they had to make a living in private practice. By retaining the honorary system paediatricians in RAHC were obliged to give priority to their interests outside the hospital so that scientific medicine expanded only slowly. In RCH service development and research were enhanced because the conflicts of interest were reduced and paediatricians could devote more of their time to the hospital without compromising their other roles. The development of a new specialty required the acquisition by members of professional power, authority and status. This process was assisted by the formation of a professional association, but paediatricians had difficulty in creating an independent body that they controlled. For professional authority and status paediatricians in RAHC were strongly dependent on maintaining their dominant position in the hierarchy of the hospital. Although children were central to the development of paediatrics, their place at the bottom of the institutional hierarchy meant they were disempowered and unable to influence the development of the specialty.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">paediatrics</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">new south wales</field><field name="subject">1945 -1965</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatio-temporal hidden Markov models for incorporating interannual variability in rainfall</field><field name="creator">Frost, Andrew James</field><field name="description">Two new spatio-temporal hidden Markov models (HMM) are introduced in this thesis, with the purpose of capturing the persistent, spatially non-homogeneous nature of climate influence on annual rainfall series observed in Australia. The models extend the two-state HMM applied by Thyer (2001) by relaxing the assumption that all sites are under the same climate control. The Switch HMM (SHMM) allows at-site anomalous states, whilst still maintaining a regional control. The Regional HMM (RHMM), on the other hand, allows sites to be partitioned into different Markovian state regions. The analyses were conducted using a Bayesian framework to explicitly account for parameter uncertainty and select between competing hypotheses. Bayesian model averaging was used for comparison of the HMM and its generalisations. The HMM, SHMM and RHMM were applied to four groupings of four sites located on the Eastern coast of Australia, an area that has previously shown evidence of interannual persistence. In the majority of case studies, the RHMM variants showed greatest posterior weight, indicating that the data favoured the multiple region RHMM over the single region HMM or the SHMM variants. In no cases does the HMM produce the maximum marginal likelihood when compared to the SHMM and RHMM. The HMM state series and preferred model variants were sensitive to the parameterisation of the small-scale site-to-site correlation structure. Several parameterisations of the small-scale Gaussian correlation were trialled, namely Fitted Correlation, Exponential Decay Correlation, Empirical and Zero Correlation. Significantly, it was shown that annual rainfall data outliers can have a large effect on inference for a model that uses Gaussian distributions. The practical value of this modelling is demonstrated by the conditioning of the event based point rainfall model DRIP on the hidden state series of the HMM variants. Short timescale models typically underestimate annual variability because there is no explicit structure to incorporate long-term persistence. The two-state conditioned DRIP model was shown to reproduce the annual variability observed to a greater degree than the single state DRIP.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">annual rainfall</field><field name="subject">stochastic</field><field name="subject">Bayesian modelling</field><field name="subject">model selection</field><field name="subject">hidden Markov process</field><field name="subject">water resources</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24868</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kobayashi Hideo: The Long Journey Toward Homeland, 1902-1945</field><field name="creator">Wada, James</field><field name="description">The famous Japanese critic, Kobayashi Hideo (1902&#8211;1983), passed through five broad stages up to 1945. In the first stage (1929&#8211;32), he sought to reinstate the claims of &#8220;the man,&#8221; the feeling, thinking human being, in writing, in place of the various literary dogmas adopted from the West: &#8220;Behind literature, see the man.&#8221; In the second stage, (1933&#8211;37), he attempted to define the &#8220;modern individual&#8221; in a Japanese society of change, anxiety and chaos, adopting the term the &#8220;socialized I&#8221; to explain his sense of a self integrated into society. In this period he sought a model in the West and found Dostoevsky. The impetus behind this stage can be summed up in the saying, &#8220;Behind the man, see society.&#8221; In Stage 3 (1938&#8211;39), Kobayashi concluded that the &#8220;silence&#8221; of Japanese people expressed a &#8220;wisdom&#8221; that accepted the &#8220;inevitable&#8221; or their &#8220;fate&#8221; in history. This stage can be summarized in the dictum &#8220;Behind society, see history.&#8221; Kobayashi&#8217;s key direction in stage four (1940&#8211;41) is &#8220;Behind history, see nature,&#8221; the latter term meaning nature (fused with humankind). In the fifth stage, from 1942 into the postwar period, Kobayashi adopted a Dostoevskian &#8220;harmony and serenity&#8221; in espousing a transcendence of the human realm, when the human organism in its greatest struggles sees the need for beauty in art. This stage can be summed up in the saying &#8220;Behind nature, see (that which inspires) beautiful literature.&#8221; The thesis charts these five stages with biographical material, some of it gleaned from interviews, and with analyses of Kobayashi&#8217;s works, as well as works by Dostoevsky, the alter-ego of Kobayashi from 1933&#8211;43. Kobayashi emerges as a figure who lived a complex series of intellectual and personal changes, in strong reaction to the revolutionary political and cultural transformations in prewar Japan.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese critic</field><field name="subject">Kobayashi Hideo</field><field name="subject">fate and history</field><field name="subject">Dostoevsky</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24860</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nonviolence and Youth Work Practice in Australia</field><field name="creator">Stuart, Graeme Robert</field><field name="description">This study developed a model of youth work practice based on a philosophy of nonviolence. Youth work in Australia is in the process of creating a clear self-consciousness and idea of its role, and a philosophy of nonviolence provides a strong foundation for further development. The study was based on the first three phases of intervention research (problem analysis and project planning, information gathering and synthesis, and design) within a heuristic paradigm. It involved a literature review, a telephone survey of 60 youth workers, in-depth interviews with 20 young people and 15 youth workers, and focus groups with 16 youth workers. Literature on youth work in Australia and Britain, and youth care in Canada and South Africa helped identify key features of youth work. Ten principles of nonviolence were developed based on principled nonviolence literature. The telephone survey provided a broad overview of current practice in New South Wales, and identified issues for further exploration in the interviews. The in-depth interviews with youth workers and young people explored their perceptions of violence and discrimination within their services; ways in which youth workers prevent and respond to disruptive, violent and unsafe behaviour; and ways in which youth work practice can be consistent with a philosophy of nonviolence. Based on the research, a model of nonviolent practice was developed, and then refined following focus groups with youth workers. The model encourages youth workers to be committed to nonviolence in all they do; to develop a reflective work practice; to build professional, caring relationships; to focus on power-with; to be committed to social change; to apply principles of social justice; to ensure there are adequate, appropriate staff and resources; to negotiate clear expectations and boundaries; to create a positive environment; to respond to behaviour nonviolently; and to facilitate informal education.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-violence</field><field name="subject">Mahatma Gandhi</field><field name="subject">Martin Luther King</field><field name="subject">Starhawk</field><field name="subject">social work</field><field name="subject">welfare</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24921</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality of Heterogeneous Services with Distributed Resource Management for a WCDMA Uplink</field><field name="creator">Das, Pratik</field><field name="description">A radio resource management scheme for WCDMA uplinks is proposed that manages quality of service (QoS) for heterogeneous services whilst maintaining high channel utilisation efficiency. The proposed system is partitioned into the 3 modules, viz. a QoS-sensitive rate scheduler, an inter-service and intra-service user prioritisation schemes, and a frame admission controller for dynamic resource reallocation. Users are allocated the minimum resources required to manage their QoS requirements through just-in-time delivery of payload, leaving more room for best-effort service users. The transmission urgency of each user is estimated by the rate scheduler based on a target transmission delay - a unique parameter used in the proposed resource management strategy to enable just-in-time payload delivery, service differentiation, and uncomplicated mapping of application requirements to QoS parameters. Transmission rate change requests from the rate schedulers are collectively processed through inter-service and intra-service priority queuing in a manner that is shown to exhibit fairness in allocation of resources amongst users of a heavily loaded network. The performance of the proposed strategy is explored through discrete-event simulations for 3 classes of traffic - voice, video and data, over the WCDMA uplink in the presence of short-term Rayleigh fading, ARQ, FEC, target transmission delays and FER targets in a multi-cell environment. Two alternatives for distributed resource management have been studied, with the UE or Node-B in control of resource allocation. The UE controlled resource management system is shown to achieve higher channel utilisation efficiency at the cost of fairness. The Node-B controlled resource manager respects the priority of speech, video and data traffic in heavily loaded systems, as reflected in 95 percentile packet transmission delays.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">WCDMA</field><field name="subject">radio resource management</field><field name="subject">RRM</field><field name="subject">Quality of Service</field><field name="subject">scheduling</field><field name="subject">uplink</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24763</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantisation Issues in Feedback Control</field><field name="creator">Haimovich, Hernan</field><field name="description">Systems involving quantisation arise in many areas of engineering, especially when digital implementations are involved. In this thesis we consider different aspects of quantisation in feedback control systems. We study two topics of interest: (a) quantisers that quadratically stabilise a given system and are efficient in the use of their quantisation levels and (b) the derivation of ultimate bounds for perturbed systems, especially when the perturbations arise from the use of quantisers. In the first part of the thesis we address problem (a) above. We consider quadratic stabilisation of discrete-time multiple-input systems by means of quantised static feedback and we measure the efficiency of a quantiser via the concept of quantisation density. Intuitively, the lower the density of a quantiser is, the more separated its quantisation levels are. We thus deal with the problem of optimising density over all quantisers that quadratically stabilise a given system with respect to a given control Lyapunov function. Most of the available results on this problem treat single-input systems, and the ones that deal with the multiple-input case consider only two-input systems. In this thesis, we derive several new results for multiple-input systems and also provide an alternative approach to deal with the single-input case. Our new results for multiple-input systems include the derivation of the structure of optimal quantisers and the explicit design of multivariable quantisers with finite density that are able to quadratically stabilise systems having an arbitrary number of inputs. For single-input systems, we provide an alternative approach to the analysis and design of optimal quantisers by establishing a link between the separation of the quantisation levels of a quantiser and the size of its quantisation regions. In the second part of the thesis we address problem (b) above. In the presence of perturbations, asymptotic stabilisation may not be possible. However, there may exist a bounded region that contains the equilibrium point and has the property that the system trajectories converge to this bounded region. When this bounded region exists, we say that the system trajectories are ultimately bounded, and that this bounded region is an ultimate bound for the system. The size of the ultimate bound quantifies the performance of the system in steady state. Hence, it is important to derive ultimate bounds that are as tight as possible. This part of the thesis addresses the problem of ultimate bound computation in settings involving several scalar quantisers, each having different features. We consider each quantised variable in the system to be a perturbed copy of the corresponding unquantised variable. This turns the original quantised system into a perturbed system, where the perturbation has a natural \emph{componentwise} bound. Moreover, according to the type of quantiser employed, the perturbation bound may depend on the system state. Typical methods to estimate ultimate bounds are based on the use of Lyapunov functions and usually require a bound on the norm of the perturbation. Applying these methods in the setting considered here may disregard important information on the structure of the perturbation bound. We therefore derive ultimate bounds on the system states that explicitly take account of the componentwise structure of the perturbation bound. The ultimate bounds derived also have a componentwise form, and can be systematically computed without having to, e.g. select a suitable Lyapunov function for the system. The results of this part of the thesis, though motivated by quantised systems, apply to more general perturbations, not necessarily arising from quantisation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantization density</field><field name="subject">quadratic stabilization</field><field name="subject">componentwise ultimate bounds</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24692</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reliability Analysis of Degrading Uncertain Structures - with Applications to Fatigue and Fracture under Random Loading</field><field name="creator">Beck, Andre Teofilo</field><field name="description">In the thesis, the reliability analysis of structural components and structural details subject to random loading and random resistance degradation is addressed. The study concerns evaluation of the probability of failure due to an overload of a component or structural detail, in consideration of random (environmental) loads and their combination, uncertain resistance parameters, statistical and phenomenological uncertainty and random resistance degradation mechanisms. Special attention is devoted to resistance degradation, as it introduces an additional level of difficulty in the solution of time variant reliability problems. 	The importance of this study arrives from the ageing of existing infrastructure in a world wide scale and from the lack of standards and codes for the ongoing safety management of general structures past their original design lives. In this context, probabilistic-based risk assessment and reliability analysis provide a framework for the safety management of ageing structures in consideration of inherent load and resistance uncertainty, current state of the structure, further resistance degradation, periodic inspections, in the absence of past experience and on an individual basis. In particular, the critical problem of resistance degradation due to fatigue is addressed. 	The formal solution of time variant reliability problems involves integration of local crossing rates over a conditional failure domain boundary, over time and over random resistance variables. This solution becomes very difficult in the presence of resistance degradation, as crossing rates become time dependent, and the innermost integration over the failure domain boundary has to be repeated over time. Significant simplification is achieved when the order of integrations is changed, and crossing rates are first integrated over the random failure domain boundary and then over time. In the so-called ensemble crossing rate or Ensemble Up-crossing Rate (EUR) approximation, the arrival rate of the first crossing over a random barrier is approximated by the ensemble average of crossings. This approximation conflicts with the Poisson assumption of independence implied in the first passage failure model, making results unreliable and highly conservative.	Despite significant simplification of the solution, little was known to date about the quality of the EUR approximation. In this thesis, a simulation procedure to obtain Poissonian estimates of the arrival rate of the first up-crossing over a random barrier is introduced. The procedure is used to predict the error of the EUR approximation. An error parameter is identified and error functions are constructed. Error estimates are used to correct original EUR failure probability results and to compare the EUR with other common simplifications of time variant reliability problems. It is found that EUR errors can be quite large even when failure probabilities are small, a result that goes against previous ideas.	A barrier failure dominance concept is introduced, to characterize those problems where an up-crossing or overload failure is more likely to be caused by a small outcome of the resistance than by a large outcome of the load process. It is shown that large EUR errors are associated with barrier failure dominance, and that solutions which simplify the load part of the problem are more likely to be appropriate in this case. It is suggested that the notion of barrier failure dominance be used to identify the proper (simplified) solution method for a given problem. In this context, the EUR approximation is compared with Turkstra&#8217;s load combination rule and with the point-crossing formula.	It is noted that in many practical structural engineering applications involving environmental loads like wind, waves or earthquakes, load process uncertainty is larger than resistance uncertainty. In these applications, barrier failure dominance in unlikely and EUR errors can be expected to be small.	The reliability problem of fatigue and fracture under random loading is addressed in the thesis. A solution to the problem, based on the EUR approximation, is constructed. The problem is formulated by combining stochastic models of crack propagation with the first passage failure model. The solution involves evaluation of the evolution in time of crack size and resistance distributions, and provides a fresh random process-based approach to the problem. It also simplifies the optimization and planning of non-destructive periodic inspection strategies, which play a major role in the ongoing safety management of fatigue affected structures.	It is shown how sensitivity coefficients of a simplified preliminary First Order Reliability solution can be used to characterize barrier failure dominance. In the fatigue and fracture reliability problem, barrier failure dominance can be caused by large variances of resistance or crack growth parameters. Barrier failure dominance caused by resistance parameters leads to problems where overload failure is an issue and where the simplified preliminary solution is likely to be accurate enough. Barrier failure dominance caused by crack growth parameters leads to highly non-linear problems, where critical crack growth dominates failure probabilities. Finally, in the absence of barrier failure dominance, overload failure is again the issue and the EUR approximation becomes not just appropriate but also accurate.	The random process-based EUR solution of time-variant reliability problems developed and the concept of barrier failure dominance introduced in the thesis have broad applications in problems involving general forms of resistance degradation as well as in problems of random vibration of uncertain structures.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">structural reliability</field><field name="subject">random variables</field><field name="subject">random processes</field><field name="subject">crossing rates</field><field name="subject">metal fatigue</field><field name="subject">fracture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Evaluation of the Alconfrontation Approach in the Treatment of Male Alcoholics</field><field name="creator">Waring, Trevor Clifton</field><field name="description">With international concern growing over the sharp increase in alcohol-related physical, psychological and social problems, effort has been directed over the past decade toward arresting the growth of the situation created by alcoholism in western society.  Alcoholism is defined and treatment approaches are discussed, along with the methodological problems encountered in evaluating such approaches.  An innovative technique, ALCONFRONTATION, is described and examined. Encouraging claims have been made by the author of Alconfrontation in provoking drug dependent persons to choose to become independent of their drug of choice. A study designed to evaluate the impact of the technique in comparison with another treatment approach and a control group of "no treatment" is described.  Cases diagnosed alcoholic who were consecutively admitted to a psychiatric admission centre were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. Pre-treatment data were collected on all subjects prior to treatment.  The groups were followed up six to seven months later and comparisons were made between groups on variables related to life style and sobriety using Chi-square and Federighi's Exact test. Absence of significant differences between groups indicated no evidence of treatment effect. Few subjects were sober on follow-up. It is concluded that Alconfrontation did not positively affect the drinking behaviour and life patterns of alcoholics in this study. Further research is suggested to determine if the technique has any negative impact. Recommendations for alternative management and treatment of chronic alcoholics are made. A two level programme consisting of a community co operative support system and a "Total Push" interdisciplinary team treatment facility is suggested and outlined.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alcohol</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">outcomes</field><field name="subject">confrontation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of a Plunging Jet Bubble Column</field><field name="creator">Evans, Geoffrey Michael</field><field name="description">The hydrodynamic phenomena occurring inside the enclosed downcomer section of a plunging jet bubble column are described in the study. The gas entrainment rate for a plunging liquid jet was found to consist of two components, namely the gas trapped within the effective jet diameter at the point of impact, and the gas contained within the film between the jet and induction trumpet surface at the point of rupture. Entrainment within the effective jet diameter has been examined by McCarthy (1972). In this study, a model was supported by the experimental results, provided the film attained a region of constant thickness. When the induction trumpet was ruptured prior to a constant film thickness being reached, the measured rate of filmwise entrainment was higher than the prediction. Filmwise entrainment was found to be initiated once a critical velocity along the surface of the induction trumpet was reached. The critical velocity was a function only of the liquid physical properties and was independent of the jet conditions and downcomer diameter. The velocity of the free surface of the induction trumpet was obtained from the velocity profile for the recirculating eddy generated by the confined plunging liquid jet. The jet angle used to describe the expansion of the submerged jet inside the downcomer was predicted from the radial diffusion of jet momentum into the recirculation eddy. The model was able to predict the jet angle when it was assumed that the radial diffusion of jet momentum was a function of the Euler number based on the jet velocity and absolute pressure in the headspace at the top of the downcomer. The model was also developed to predict the maximum stable bubble diameter generated within the submerged jet volume, where the energy dissipation attributed to bubble breakup was given by the energy mixing loss derived for the throat section of a liquid-jet-gas-pump. Good agreement was found between the measured and predicted maximum bubble diameter values. The average experimental Sauter mean/maximum diameter ratio was found to be 0.61, which was similar to that for other bubble generation devices. It was found that for turbulent liquid conditions in the uniform two-phase flow region, a transition from bubble to churn-turbulent flow occurred at a gas void fraction of approximately 0.2 when the gas drift-flux was zero. Under laminar liquid flow, this transition took place at a gas void fraction above 0.3. For the bubbly flow regime the Distribution parameter Co used by Zuber and Findlay (1965) to describe the velocity and gas void fraction profile, was found to be a function of the liquid Reynolds number. For laminar liquid flow, values of Co greater than unity were obtained. As the liquid Reynolds number was increased it was found that Co decreased, until a constant value of unity was obtained for fully turbulent flow. For the churn-turbulent regime it was found that the gas void fraction measurements for all of the experimental runs could be collapsed onto a single curve when a modified gas void fraction was plotted against the gas-to-liquid volumetric flow ratio. The modified gas void fraction included a correction factor to account for the difference in the bubble slip velocity between the experimental runs. The experimental results also indicated that the value of the constant in the gas void fraction correction factor was different for laminar and turbulent flow. Prior to bubble coalescence, it was found that the experimental drift-flux curves could be predicted from the measured bubble diameter, using the separated flow model development by Ishii and Zuber (1979). After the onset of coalescence the drift flux measurements departed from the original drift-flux curves at a rate which increased linearly with increasing gas void fraction. It was found that the slope of the line fitted to the coalesced region of the drift-flux curves increased with increasing liquid Reynolds number and reached a constant value under fully turbulent flow conditions. The model developed, together with the implications of the experimental results, are discussed with regard to optimising the design of an industrial plunging jet bubble column.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Confined plunging liquid jet</field><field name="subject">bubble column</field><field name="subject">entrainment</field><field name="subject">bubble breakup</field><field name="subject">two phase flow</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24721</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural and Electrophysiological Correlates of Anticipatory Task-Set Reconfiguration</field><field name="creator">Nicholson, Rebecca Anne</field><field name="description">The concept of a unitary cognitive control system has increasingly come under question. Numerous paradigms have emerged that aim to dissect cognitive control into its constituent processes, including task-switching paradigms that require alternation between multiple tasks. A switch in task is associated with increased reaction time (RT) as compared to a repeat in task, which is proposed to at least partially reflect processes associated with reconfiguration of the currently active task-set. Previous event-related brain potential studies show a differential positivity emerging prior to a switch in task that appears to reflect anticipatory task-set reconfiguration. Six experiments were conducted that investigated the behavioural and ERP correlates of task-switching, and in particular, the cognitive control processes involved in anticipatory task-set reconfiguration. Experiment 1 dissociated the effects of passive dissipation of task-set interference from anticipatory task-set reconfiguration. In Experiment 2, it was further verified that the switch-related differential positivity reflects processes associated with anticipatory task-set reconfiguration, particularly initiation of the new task-set. A simplified paradigm was developed in Experiment 3 that maximised engagement in anticipatory task-set reconfiguration, reducing mean RT switch cost. Experiment 4 demonstrated that the RT switch cost and differential positivity in cueing paradigms are associated with task-set reconfiguration rather than a cue repetition benefit. Consistent with previous brain imaging studies, Experiment 5 revealed that anticipatory task-set reconfiguration is associated with increased activation in the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe. These findings show that task-set reconfiguration processes are activated when switching between tasks and that this consists of multiple components including the active utilisation of cognitive control processes in anticipatory task-set reconfiguration. Task-switching paradigms are thus a useful tool for investigating control processes in healthy populations and as Experiment 6 demonstrates, in clinical populations that have deficits in control processes, such as patients with schizophrenia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">task-switching</field><field name="subject">cognitive control processes</field><field name="subject">ERPs</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Promoting the musculoskeletal health of Indigenous Australians living in rural Communities. Aboriginal Health in Aboriginal Hands</field><field name="creator">Vindigni, Dein</field><field name="description">To date, there has been only limited research investigating the musculoskeletal health of Indigenous Australians. Nevertheless, the pain and disability associated with musculoskeletal conditions are thought to be high. This thesis reports on the outcomes of a cross-sectional survey and clinical assessment designed to measure the prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions, and uses them to inform the development of a community-based musculoskeletal training program for Indigenous Australians living in one of the largest rural Indigenous communities in Australia.  There were three separate community-based studies comprising this thesis: The first describes the development of measures for assessing the prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions and the associated risk factors and barriers to managing these conditions for people living in this Community. The development of a screening survey and clinical assessment protocol was based on a literature search, existing validated measures, feedback from Indigenous focus groups and pilot testing with Indigenous people in order to achieve cultural appropriateness. The second study piloted the research tools, then measured and assessed the prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions, associated risk factors and barriers to managing these conditions in the Community. The third study describes the development and implementation of a preliminary community-based intervention delivered by AHWs that responded to the outcomes of the prevalence study. It assessed the cultural acceptability of a musculoskeletal training program (MTP), as well as piloting an approach to assessing changes in skills and knowledge of Aboriginal Health Workers (AHWs) who participated in the MTP.  The conduct of these studies reiterates the difficulties associated with conducting studies in Indigenous Communities according to mainstream concepts, which rely on randomly selecting participants in order to achieve generalisability to the larger population. Beyond empowering Indigenous people through sustainable, community-based training initiatives, lies the immediate need to improve access to musculoskeletal health services and to remove this current and considerable barrier to improving the musculoskeletal health of Indigenous Australians. The conclusions of this thesis highlight the importance of giving consideration to cultural sensitivity and collaboration in planning health service delivery to Indigenous people. The application of the community-based model used in this study may have the potential to be seeded in Communities throughout the country as a step towards promoting the musculoskeletal health of Indigenous people living in rural Australia and beyond.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">musculoskeletal</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Australians</field><field name="subject">rural communities</field><field name="subject">aboriginal health</field><field name="subject">aborigines</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prospective Surveillance Of Surgical Site Infections At A Tertiary Hospital In Viet Nam And The Impact Of A Bedside Hand Sanitizer Program</field><field name="creator">Le, Thi Anh Thu</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT BACKGROUND. There have been few studies conducted in hospitalized patients in Viet nam on the epidemiology of surgical site infections (SSIs) and the impact of hand hygiene practices. This study aimed to assess the impact of a bedside hand sanitizer program on SSIs in orthopaedic and neurosurgical patients. DESIGN. A prospective quasi-experimental study was conducted with an untreated control group design in neurosurgical patients and before-after design in orthopaedic patients. A cost analysis based on data derived from the results of this study was also performed. SETTING. Cho Ray Hospital, a tertiary university hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet nam. PATIENTS. All patients admitted for operation between 11 July and 15 August 2000 (Before), and 14 July and 18 August 2001 (After) were included, except those who had undergone another operation within one month prior to admission or were admitted because of SSIs. INTERVENTION. Bedside hand sanitizers were introduced into the Orthopaedic ward and one Neurosurgical ward (Ward A) from September 2000. Training on proper use was also provided to ward staff. Another Neurosurgical ward (Ward B) was used as a control group with no intervention conducted. RESULTS. A total of 1368 patients were recruited into the study. After intervention, in Ward A of the neurosurgical department, the SSI rate between the two periods was reduced by 54% (8.3% to 3.8%; p=0.09). Superficial SSIs were eliminated after the intervention (p=0.007). Comparison between Ward A (intervention) and Ward B (control) showed that, before the intervention, there was no difference in incidence of SSI between the two wards (Ward A: 8.3%, Ward B: 7.2%, p=0.7); however, after intervention, the incidence of SSI in Ward A was significantly lower than Ward B (3.8% and 9.2%, p=0.04). For orthopaedic patients, the SSI rate between the two periods was reduced by 34% (14.8% to 9.8%; p=0.07). SSI patients had a median post-operative length of stay of 19 days longer than patients without SSI (p&amp;lt0.001). Costs were 2.5 times higher in patients with in-hospital SSI compared to uninfected patients (p&amp;lt0.001). Mean SSI-attributable costs were conservatively estimated at US$368 in neurosurgical patients and US$207 in the orthopaedic patients in the before period. SSIs were responsible for at least 14 percent of the annual budget before intervention. The savings per SSI prevented were estimated at US$332 in neurosurgical patients and US$157 in orthopaedic patients. Annual cost savings arising from the intervention were estimated at US$11,112 in orthopaedic patients and US$19,320 in neurosurgical patients. CONCLUSIONS. The incidence of SSI in the hospital was high. The use of hand sanitizers reduced SSI rates, particularly impacting on the incidence of superficial SSIs. The hand sanitization program was found to be a dominant intervention being both more effective and cost saving as compared with no intervention in both study departments. The use of bedside hand sanitizers should be encouraged in the hospitals in Viet nam, where there often is a lack of other hand-washing facilities.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">surgical site infection</field><field name="subject">hand sanitizer program</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Problem Solving Appraisal, Hopeless and Coping Resources: A Test of a Suicide Ideation Model.</field><field name="creator">Waring, John Clifton</field><field name="description">Schotte and Clum (1982,1987) proposed a model of suicide ideation in which cognitive rigidity (in the presenc eof negative life stress) causes a reduction in problem solving capacity and subsequently leads to hopelessness, which in turn increases the risk for suicide ideation.

Method: Data from three rural provinces of Vietnam collected by the Vietnam Australia Primary Health Care Project were analysed using descriptive and analytical statistical techniques including multivariate regression, multipart analysis and hierarchical techniques. A sample of 1335 eligible women was available for analysis. The Andersen Health Behaviour Model was utilised in analyses of ANC utilisation. The Donabedian Quality of Health Model was used in analyses of ANC content and overall adequacy. Results: ANC was inadequate with only 71% of women having some ANC, 51% having initial visits within the first four months, 41% having three or more visits, 35% having three or more visits with the initial visits within the first four months, 17% of women reported three quarter or more of recommended ANC procedures/advice, 12% of women had enough ANC utilisation and fair ANC content. Factors that existed prior to contact with health care providers such as external environment, predisposing and need were related to whether the women seek any ANC and to pregnancy duration at first visits. However, factors that resulted from initial contact with health care providers, such as satisfaction of women with ANC services and health care provider related characteristics, were important in the models examining total number of ANC visits, overall ANC utilisation, content of ANC reported and overall ANC adequacy. Province of residence related to all aspects of ANC adequacy. Different aspects of ANC adequacy were related to each other. Conclusion: ANC adequacy levels in Vietnam were low. To increase the proportions of women who use ANC services and attend ANC early, promotion of ANC should be targeted at women at risk. However, to improve continuation with ANC, ANC content, and overall ANC adequacy, the quality of services provided needs to be improved. To reduce the gap between provinces, priority should be given to less developed provinces.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antenatal care</field><field name="subject">health service utilisation</field><field name="subject">quality of care</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24876</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remote X-Ray Operator Radiography: A Case Study In Interprofessional Rural Clinical Practice</field><field name="creator">Smith, Anthony Neil</field><field name="description">In some rural and remote locations in New South Wales and elsewhere in Australia, a limited range of radiographic examinations may be performed by nurses and general practitioners if there is no radiographer available. These so called remote x-ray operators are licensed under the New South Wales Radiation Control Act 1990. This study aimed to investigate the experiences and perceptions of remote x-ray operator radiography and examine the role of remote operators in New South Wales from the perspective of a cohort of rural radiographers and nurse and GP remote x-ray operators involved in frontline delivery of rural radiographic services. Methodology Semi-structured in-depth interviews were performed with twenty rural radiographers, ten rural nurses and seven rural general practitioners from various rural communities in New South Wales. Interview questions explored the informants&#8217; knowledge, opinions and values, experience and behaviour, and attitudes and feelings in relation to remote x-ray operator radiography. Interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed. Data analysis was subsequently performed using an iterative process based on a modified grounded theory methodology. Data labelling and comparative analysis were carried out in parallel with data collection, allowing progressive modification of the interview theme list to ensure that theoretical saturation was achieved. Results Data analysis led to the emergence of three key concepts, together with their relevant themes and sub-themes. The primary key concept, &#8216;Dimensions of Practice&#8217;, was inclusive of the central precepts of remote x-ray operator radiography. It includes themes titled &#8216;Licence Conditions and Limitations&#8217;, &#8216;Competency Requirements&#8217; and &#8216;Image Quality and Practice Standards&#8217;. The key concept of &#8216;Service Provision and Equity of Access&#8217;, represents the realities of clinical practice in the rural and remote health care setting. It includes themes of &#8216;Clinical Management and Decision Making&#8217;, &#8216;Access and Availability&#8217;, &#8216;Patient Expectations&#8217; and &#8216;Commitment to Service&#8217;. The third key concept is &#8216;Professional Roles and Relationships&#8217;, which deals with the interactions that take place between individual practitioners and the factors that influence them. It encompasses the xii themes of &#8216;Boundary Delineation&#8217;, &#8216;Professional Status and Esteem&#8217; and &#8216;Interprofessional Conflict and Collaboration&#8217;. Relationships between the key concepts, via their themes and sub-themes were also explored. Conclusions Analysis of the data led to the development of a conceptual model and a single story line that represent the perspectives of the study informants. Remote x-ray operator radiography takes place at the intersection of the occupational worlds of rural radiographers, nurses and general practitioners. Remote operators provide a valuable service that prevents rural residents having to travel to access minor radiographic examinations. However, the quality of the radiography they perform is below the standard expected of radiographers. Improvements in collaborative teamwork could improve the quality of service, although interprofessional communication is stifled by status and hierarchical relationships. The remote x-ray operator experience may inform the development of future models of health care.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radiography</field><field name="subject">rural and remote health</field><field name="subject">interprofessional boundaries</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feedback Control over Signal to Noise Ratio Constrained Communication Channels</field><field name="creator">Rojas Norman, Alejandro Jose</field><field name="description">The present thesis addresses the problem of stabilisability of a linear time invariant (LTI) output feedback control loop in the presence of a communication link.

The communication link is assumed to be an additive coloured Gaussian noise channel with (or without) bandwidth limitation (memory) in the continuous-(or discrete-)time domain. The requirement for stabilisability of the feedback loop is then characterised as a lower bound on the channel signal to noise ratio (SNR). This lower bound is tight and it will depend on the channel model, plant and channel model NMP zeros, plant time delay and plant unstable poles.

The first part (Chapter 2) is the modelling of piezoelectric laminate structures using modal analysis and finite element methods. The second part (Chapter 4) involves the model correction of pointwise and spatial models of resonant systems. The model correction solution compensates for the errors associated with the truncation of high frequency modes. The third part (Chapter 5) is the optimal placement methodology for general actuators and sensors. In particular, optimal placement of piezoelectric actuators and sensors over a thin plate are considered and implemented in the laboratory. The last part (Chapters 6 to 8) deals with vibration control of smart structures. Several different approaches for vibration control are considered. Vibration control using resonant, spatial H-2 and H-infinity control is proposed and implemented on real systems experimentally.

Discussion then focuses on the development of the neutral mask as an object and as a paradigm of pedagogy for the actor over the past eighty years and undertakes a comparative investigation of the concept of neutrality as a performant state. The discussion takes in the teaching of Jacques Copeau, Etienne Decroux and Jacques Lecoq, and extends to the theories of Eugenio Barba, considering the possible parallels between Barba's 'pre-expressive' state and the state of neutrality which the mask assists to develop in the actor. The dissertation further proposes that the term 'performative liminality' is an appropriate term to adopt for this performant state, and makes this proposal with reference to the theories of anthropologist Victor Turner regarding the liminal state. The practice-as-research component of the project sought to investigate and document the various uses of the neutral mask and its application to the creative processes of the actor, and aimed to provide qualitative analysis and evaluation of the neutral mask when used in a developmental workshop environment. The dissertation contains a full account of the practice component of the project and details the processes used to investigate the neutral mask, offering analysis drawn from the inside experiences of the actors and the outside observations of the researcher. Within that analysis is a consideration of the neutral mask as a tool for developing the scenic presence of the actor.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neutral mask</field><field name="subject">masks</field><field name="subject">actor training</field><field name="subject">liminality</field><field name="subject">pre-expressivity</field><field name="subject">scenic presence</field><field name="subject">physical acting</field><field name="subject">mime</field><field name="subject">practice as research</field><field name="subject">Jacques Copeau</field><field name="subject">Etienne Decroux</field><field name="subject">Eugenio Barba</field><field name="subject">Jacques Lecoq</field><field name="subject">Victor Turner</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neoliberalism and discourse: case studies of knowledge policies in the Asia-Pacific</field><field name="creator">Grewal, Baljit</field><field name="description">This thesis examines policy documents relating to the knowledge society of six Asia-Pacific countries (India, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Fiji and New Zealand). I employ Norman Fairclough&#8217;s version of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to explore the discursive construction of knowledge-related policies within a comparative case study methodology. Leximancer &#8211; a computer software for text analysis is used to assist in operationalising parts of the CDA. The general conclusions drawn from the study indicate that the evolving knowledge policy discourse in the Asia-Pacific is not based on any robust theoretical framework but on international and country-specific paradigms of the knowledge society. In the policy discourses, the knowledge society is posited as a desired outcome in light of external (global) imperatives - economic globalisation, technological knowledge and innovation flows, and ICT revolution &#8211; which are married to context-specific developmental imperatives arising from geography, culture, history and polity. This hybridisation process gives shape to unique knowledge society paradigms of each country. My CDA analysis shows that the ideology of neoliberalism is a key discursive influence on the knowledge society paradigms and is mutated by differences in contexts across different countries. In the discourses, neoliberalism operates via an emphasis on policy restructuring (privatisation, deregulation and liberalisation), and streamlining of governance mechanisms relating to key knowledge and information policy sectors. The resulting knowledge society constructions are context and time-dependent frameworks and exhibit two core arguments of convergence in all the case studies:  (1) ICT and Science &amp; Technology as vehicles for knowledge-based development need to grow in an enabling policy environment and; (2) the twin imperatives of globalisation and technological revolution mean that knowledge policy should have a competitive and innovation orientation, and should be continuously readjusted in tune with global economic changes. In addition to convergence, there are two major issues of divergence, namely: (1) emphasis on affirmative action in knowledge-related policies of India, Malaysia, and Fiji; (2) the promotion of cultural production and creative industries in Singapore, New Zealand, and more recently in Korea. The original contribution of this thesis is that it provides a reassessment of the role of neoliberalism in knowledge society. The study is novel both in the selection of the problem and the methodology. Comparative case studies using CDA have not been attempted at the regional scale and not with this level of documentary data. The use of Leximancer improves the management of textual data and increases the validity of the interpretations. A study of this magnitude has not been attempted for the Asia-Pacific region previously. Finally, the conclusions drawn from applying the CDA are both persuasive and creative in terms of analysing policy discourses of the knowledge society.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge society</field><field name="subject">Knowledge economy</field><field name="subject">Neoliberalism</field><field name="subject">Critical Discourse Analysis</field><field name="subject">Asia Pacific</field><field name="subject">Knowledge policy</field><field name="subject">Leximancer</field><field name="subject">Information society</field><field name="subject">Policy Analysis</field><field name="subject">Sociology of knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Importance of ethical public relations in non-profit organisations</field><field name="creator">Coskun, Nurcin</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to understand the importance of public relations activity in non-profit organisations. The study emphasizes the bearing public relations activities can have on non-profit organisations in the contemporary world. This is especially true in an over communicated society where the vast majority of organisations compete to gain access to the scare media resources to put their message across to their potential clients, supporters and customers. Non-profit organisations generally have to depend on the donor agencies and therefore fail to attract a sizeable public relations budget. On the one hand, these organisations lack the resources to launch a successful public relations campaign and on the other the lack of knowledge and interest among general staff members makes it even harder for a public relations campaign to be developed or successfully launched. In this study, I used both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies to collect and analyse data. The data were collected from two non-profit organisations based in New Zealand working in the area of child welfare. The primary data were collected through semi-structured interviews and survey questionnaires. A single semi-structured interview was conducted with each team leader of the two selected organisations. However, this was like skimming the surface and in-depth interviews would have helped me to collect richer data. On the other hand the data collected was sufficient for this research and it helped me to create a holistic understanding of the topic. The findings of the research highlight that most non-profit organisations working in the area of child welfare find it hard to market themselves due to a lack of funds and employee involvement. Although the findings from the study are significant; caution is necessary in applying the results to other scenarios and in making generalizations. One of the key findings from this research is that both organisations did not use public relations as a strategy. Most decision related to public relations was made on random basis and no long term strategic plan was made to adopt public relations as a core strategy to build creditability among their stakeholders.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public relations</field><field name="subject">Non-profit organisations</field><field name="subject">Business strategy</field><field name="subject">Reputation management</field><field name="subject">Ethics</field><field name="subject">Media content analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Futurority : narratives of the future : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts (Social Policy), Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kenkel, David</field><field name="description">This thesis examines narratives of the future and their impact on late-modern constructions of the self. The argument is made that neo-liberal narratives have effectively promoted an idealised narrative of the self that views the achievement of a desired future for individuals as primarily a function of personal autonomy, effort and intention. The thesis contends that this narrative is promoted in society through multiple trajectories involving an array of social forms and institutions. Education policy and media are considered as exemplary examples of the sorts of social forms and institutions where this idealising narrative is promoted. A limited range of education policy narratives and media narratives are then examined. The position is taken that the adoption of neo-liberal ideals of the self relies on a supporting context of other narratives of the self and society. These are explored. A governmental framework (Rose, 1998) is used to consider the implications for child and adult subjects of the adoption of an individualised culpability for future success, or lack of success within what is argued is a subjectifying discursive regime of the self. Resistance to this governing regime is considered from a number of theoretical perspectives. The contention is made that effective resistance is likely to be local, partial and continuous rather than involving or resembling a disjunctive ideological shift. The thesis engages with post-structuralist ideas and hence is written from a perspective that necessarily incorporates a local and personal narrative.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">narrative</field><field name="subject">self</field><field name="subject">neo-liberal</field><field name="subject">social policy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370102 Social policy and planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF IRON AND FERRITIN METABOLISM IN</field><field name="creator">Xu, Xiangcong</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anti-cancer</field><field name="subject">anthracyclines</field><field name="subject">iron metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanical behaviour of human enamel and the relationship to its structural and compositional characteristics</field><field name="creator">He, Lihong</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enamel, Nanoindentation, Mechanical properties, dental materials</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of vermicomposting in domestic onsite sewage and biowaste management</field><field name="creator">Panikkar, Avanish Kesava</field><field name="description">Modern lifestyle has increased the amount of solid and liquid waste that humans create.

The proposed natural system is close to natural resources and uses biological waste processing methods that have proven to be saustainable. Available resources and low cost give an edge for such processes to be practical and realistic. The system is based on vermicomposting. Composting worms survive in the harsh environments found in most parts of the developing world.

The novel is inspired by Stephen Hawking&#8217;s &#8216;A brief history of time&#8217; and his &#8216;arrows of time&#8217;: the thermodynamic arrow, in which entropy increases; the psychological arrow, the direction in which we feel time pass; and the cosmological arrow, the direction of time in which the universe expands. The literary techniques adopted in the writing of the novel are discussed, as is the author&#8217;s research into the construction of time in literary discourse and its relationship to religious, philosophical, historical and psychological constructions. The catalytic force of scientific thought and discovery as it resonates through these fields is traced. Modernist and Postmodernist writing is examined, the Modernists with their technique of time-displacement and the Postmodernists with their exploration of randomness and discontinuity in the belief that it is the profound and discernable effect of the entropy and escalating change in a world of scientific uncertainty on the writing process itself.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">time in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/31124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thus, saith the serpent : eight flesholds on a descent into word</field><field name="creator">Lingham, Susie</field><field name="description">This is a fictitious and interdisciplinary speculation on the signification of engendered subjectivities, engaging with concepts from art history, critical theory, philosophy, religious philosophy and iconography, science, visual art, fiction and poetry.

When this 'bubble economy' was pierced and deflated, the impact could be felt in all business sectors. The new century is an opportune time for changes.For example, sustainable resolutions should be collaborations involving the SAR Government and the tourism and hotel industry to ensure the support of the practitioners.

The Rindler coordinate system is constructed from a physical argument that shows how an observer would actually go about building such a coordinate system out of scaffolding and clocks. Quantum theory is discussed in detail with particular relevance to quantum entanglement as this is an important issue relating to information loss in black holes. The thesis demonstrates the general impossibility of utilising quantum entanglement to transmit information faster than light. Bell's theorem is also reviewed from the perspective of anti-correlated spin-half particles. This theorem shows the impossibility of describing nature by a local hidden variable theory, and hence emphasises the importance of the topic of information loss in black holes as a bridge between general relativity and quantum theory. The Unruh effect is a purely quantum field theoretic effect that displays considerable mathematical similarities to the Hawking effect. The effects are nevertheless quite dissimilar in some respects and this thesis examines some of these differences. The other aim of the thesis is to discuss the possible loss of information in a black hole. The Hawking effect raises the possibility that a black hole may evaporate and potentially disappear completely. This raises a significant problem related to how the information that entered the black hole may escape, if at all. If information cannot escape the black hole then this implies a violation of one of the principles of quantum mechanics: a pure quantum state cannot undergo unitary evolution to become a thermal distribution of radiation but this is what the Hawking effect essentially predicts. These two conclusions are new and are important contributions to the understanding of the coupling between gravity and quantum theory. The thesis also looks at a number of subsidiary topics to do with the underlying physics of these effects along the way, always with an emphasis on the physical. In particular, the method for quantizing a field is developed in a physical manner by examining the continuum limit of a quantized discretely modelled string. Two other topics within the thesis that are of interest are a demonstration of the coordinate independence of the Euler-Lagrange equations and a heuristic method of 'deriving' the Lorentz transformation equations that is presented in an appendix. These two presentations are new and have not appeared elsewhere to my knowledge.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thermodynamics</field><field name="subject">heat engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/31257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of cellular automata models to examine complexity of organizational behaviour</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Michael J.</field><field name="description">The relatively new science of complex emergent processes is being applied to many fields including the study of organizations. There are many different models of the organization in current use, each with its own benefits. However, the science of complex emergent processes is able to deal with situations that conventional models have not been able to adequately describe. Wolfram's A New Kind of Science describes a comprehensive conceptual framework and scientific methodology which enables the study of organizations from a new perspective. These techniques create new ways of thinking about organizations and provide new insights into organizational behaviour. A particular class of complex emergent models are the cellular automata (CA). This thesis makes use of very basic cellular automata models described in Wolfram's A New Kind of Science to examine organizational behaviour. These models produce a variety of interesting patterns which can be easily interpreted and which graphically describe various characteristics of organizational behaviour. A variety of common types of organizational behaviour are examined and the organizational cultures which bring these behaviours about are investigated. The usefulness of using this method is considered. These techniques are then used to examine the reconstructing of Iraq in the period from the US led Coalition invasion in 2003 through to mid 2004. Several types of organizational behaviour are examined and the models are then used to examine various potential scenarios concerning the Iraq reconstruction process. The modelling outcomes about the Iraq reconstruction process are found to be comparable with the opinions of subject matter experts. Although limited in scope and only making use of a very limited class of models from all of those available in Wolfram's A New Kind of Science, this thesis demonstrated the usefulness of using such an approach in the understanding of organizational behaviour. The techniques used in this thesis, were able to demonstrate: the complex emergent properties of organizations; how organizational behaviour can be viewed as resulting from the interaction of individuals; the 'phase transitions' between different major classes of organizational behaviour; how different types of organizational behaviour are robust or otherwise to change; and how organizational behaviour forms naturally into certain common types.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cellular automata</field><field name="subject">organizational effectiveness</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/30922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'With tact, intelligence and a special acquaintance with the insane' : a history of the development of mental health care(nursing) in New South Wales, Australia, Colonisation to Federation 1788 - 1901</field><field name="creator">Smith, Terrence Gordon</field><field name="description">During the earliest days of the penal colony in New South Wales in 1788, the plight of the mentally ill was given little consideration by the governing authorities, particularly the convict insane, who lived (and died) by their wits and suffered cruel punishment if their behaviour was seen as recalcitrant.

The diagnosis of many genetic diseases remains problematic. This is due in part to difficulty in detection of DNA copy number changes, when these are either too small (for conventional cytogenetics) or too large, for standard molecular approaches. From this viewpoint, the development of new screening methods with improvement of resolution is very important. Genome-wide screening at a molecular level began to appear feasible with the completion of the human genome sequence. From this beginning, high-resolution whole-genome technologies could be envisaged, to improve the diagnostic detection rate for even the smallest of chromosomal imbalances.  The technique known as ???array-based comparative genomic hybridization??? (array-CGH) does allow such a high-resolution screening, by use of reference DNA probes, printed onto arrays, thus consisting of thousands of genomic clones. In this study we extensively investigated many major aspects of array-CGH technology from preparation of microarray probes and printing microarray slides, to a development of custom protocols and custom softwares for data processing and analysis. We have trailed several array types and protocols, direct and indirect DNA labelling techniques and, as a result, we have achieved the practical application which was our target at the onset of this work. This was to use a modified array-CGH method, as a robust and economical diagnostic test in detection of deletions and duplications within the human genome. The project has been successful, in terms of one very important outcome: The laboratory in which this work was done is now the leading clinical diagnostic lab in this field, in Australia???s most populous state of New South Wales. That achievement would not have been possible without a very lengthy period of developmental work, including that which comprises much of this thesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microarray</field><field name="subject">Diagnostics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/36668</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contact resistance study on polycrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells on glass</field><field name="creator">Shi, Lei, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Thin-film solar cells are widely recognised to have the potential to compete with fossil fuels in the electricity market due to their low cost per peak Watt. The Thin-Film Group at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) is engaged in developing polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-film solar cells on glass using e-beam evaporation technology. We believe our solar cells have the potential of significantly lowering the manufacturing cost compared to conventional, PECVD-fabricated thin-film solar cells. After years of materials research, the focus of the Group??s work is now moving to the metallisation of evaporated solar cells. Minimising various kinds of losses is the main challenge of the cell metallisation procedure, within which the contact resistance is always a big issue. In this thesis, the contact resistance of aluminium contacts on poly-Si thin-film solar cells on glass is investigated. To the best of the author??s knowledge, this is the first ever contact resistance investigation of Al contacts on evaporated poly-Si material for photovoltaic applications. Various transmission line models (TLM) are employed to measure the contact resistance. An improved TLM model is developed to increase the measurement precision and, simultaneously, to simplify the TLM pattern fabrication process. In order to accommodate the particular requirements of poly-Si coated glass substrates, a TLM pattern fabrication process using photolithography is established. Furthermore, a Kelvin sense tester is set up to ensure an accurate measurement of the contact resistance. After establishment of the TLM technique at UNSW, it is successfully tested on singlecrystalline silicon wafer samples. The thermal annealing process of the contacts is also optimised. Then, the general behaviour of Al contacts on uniformly doped poly-Si films (i.e., no p-n junction) is investigated using the verified TLM technique. The long-term stability of the contacts is also studied. This is followed by an investigation of the contact resistance of the back surface field and emitter layers of different types of poly-Si thin-film solar cells. Finally, a novel contact resistance measurement model is proposed that is believed to be able to overcome the measurement bottleneck of the transmission line models.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Poly-Si</field><field name="subject">Contact resistance</field><field name="subject">Thin-film solar cells</field><field name="subject">Transmission line model</field><field name="subject">Polycrystalline semiconductors</field><field name="subject">Solar cells</field><field name="subject">Glass</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transparent large-page support for Itanium linux</field><field name="creator">Wienand, Ian Raymond, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The abstraction provided by virtual memory is central to the operation of modern operating systems. Making the most efficient use of the available translation hardware is critical to achieving high performance. The multiple page-size support provided by almost all architectures promises considerable benefits but poses a number of implementation challenges.  This thesis presents a minimally-invasive approach to transparent multiple page-size support for Itanium Linux. In particular, it examines the interaction between supporting large pages and Itanium's two inbuilt hardware page-table walkers; one being a virtual linear page-table with limited support for storing different page-size translations and the other a more flexible but higher overhead hash table based translation cache.  Compared to a single-page-size kernel, a range of benchmarks show performance improvements when multiple page-sizes are available, generally large working sets that stress the TLB.

Analysis shows that the increased TLB coverage, resulting from the use of large pages, frequently does not reduce TLB miss rates sufficiently to make up for the increased cost of TLB reloads.

Photographic images have great potential to investigate different social practices and phenomena in the world.  Photography, in its own right, is an extremely large area of study. Despite its relatively short history, photography has undergone a broad and complex evolution since it was invented in 1840. This paper does not aim to cover the comprehensive history of the development of photography in its many facets, it aims however to concentrate on a specific area of what has come to be termed visual sociology and the potential of the still photographic image as a primary tool within the field.  Visual sociology is a marginal, experimental area of sociology, it is a field which has not been given due consideration by many sociologists due to its unscientific nature and one which remains unfamiliar to many social documentary photographers.  This paper traces the history of visual sociology and explores its roots and links with social documentary photography. It explores the established methods of visual data collection that are utilised within the field of visual sociology. It also explores a further sub-discipline, urban sociology and the role of the image in investigation of urban phenomena.  The resulting practical component of this research is an extensive urban photographic investigation shot over the period of one month in the city of Tokyo. The resulting series of images exist as a type of photographic visual map of &#145;city creatures&#146; ubiquitous in the urban environment. The series aims to constitute as a visual, cultural survey about an aspect of social life within the Japanese urban context.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">documentary</field><field name="subject">photography</field><field name="subject">visual sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pleasure of appearances</field><field name="creator">Zamberlan, Lisa, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Decoration holds a contested position in built environment scholarship.

This review attempts to synthesise the studies&#146; findings, and tests hypotheses about the causes of the variation. Research questions ask if variation is attributable to differences in participant characteristics, different aspects of judgment having been targeted, different tasks having been performed or different training strategies having been used. Relevant literature was reviewed, and studies that reported a method for training an aspect of judgment were selected for further quantitative analysis if at least two groups had been randomly selected from a larger set of human adults, one of which received training that another did not, and where, during the test phase, members of no group had access to tools or resources, performed tasks, or received feedback which members of another group did not. A meta-analysis of statistical data from 39 published studies was conducted. The findings are interpreted as indicating variation in the effect of training is attributable to differences in task type and differences in training strategy. The effect of training is greatest in the studies that have diagnostic tasks (p&lt;0.05). The studies that trained participants with examples have, on average, greater effect sizes than studies that did not (p&lt;0.05). Implications, limitations, and avenues for further research are discussed. It is concluded that the findings indicate that different tasks and different training strategies account for a significant proportion of the variation in training effect seen between the selected studies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Choice</field><field name="subject">Judgement</field><field name="subject">Decision</field><field name="subject">Training</field><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Settlement of marine fouling organisms in response to novel antifouling coatings</field><field name="creator">Afsar, Anisul, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Surfaces submerged in marine environments rapidly get colonized by marine organisms, a process known as biofouling. Fouling costs maritime industries billions of dollars annually. The most common methods of combating marine biofouling are toxin containing antifouling coatings which often have detrimental non-target environmental effects. These effects and proposed bans on harmful substances in antifouling coatings, mandates development of more environmentally friendly antifouling technologies. Of these, foul-release coatings, which minimize attachment and adhesion of fouling organisms (rather than killing them) are promising alternatives. Here I explored the utility of petroleum waxes as novel antifouling/foul-release coatings. I first investigated the responses of propagules (larvae or spores) of six common fouling organisms to wax coatings in the laboratory. A wide variation in the response of these different organisms, and in the different types of response (settlement, adhesion, etc.) by the same organism, was observed, but the most inhibitory coatings were those made from microcrystalline wax and silicone oil. However, in field trials in Sydney Harbour, paraffin waxes had the strongest antifouling performance, with activity up to one year (the trial duration). These waxes also had strong foul-release effects, with fouling that did attach mostly removed by a low pressure water jet. Composition of fouling communities on paraffin waxes differed significantly from other waxes or controls, with little or no hard fouling organisms (barnacles, bivalves) on paraffin. The mechanisms of antifouling and foul-release actions of paraffin waxes appear to be due to changes in surface properties. The surfaces of the paraffin waxes changed noticeably after 4 - 8 weeks immersion in the sea or in seawater aquaria. Antibiotic treatments showed that this change in surface appearance was due to biological (microbial) activity. Bacteria appear to remove the amorphous phase from the surface of the paraffin waxes, revealing an underlying crystalline phase, which is less affected by bacterial action. I suggest that these crystals form a microstructured ?bed of nails? of crystals of varying shapes and sizes which inhibit settlement and reduce adhesion strength of those organisms which do settle.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foul-release</field><field name="subject">Biofouling</field><field name="subject">Antifouling</field><field name="subject">Wax</field><field name="subject">Marine fouling organisms</field><field name="subject">Coatings</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aboriginal Australian heritage in the postcolonial city: sites of anti-colonial resistance and continuing presence</field><field name="creator">Gandhi, Vidhu, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">Aboriginal Australian heritage forms a significant and celebrated part of Australian heritage. Set within the institutional frameworks of a predominantly ??white?? European Australian heritage practice, Aboriginal heritage has been promoted as the heritage of a people who belonged to the distant, pre-colonial past and who were an integral and sustainable part of the natural environment. These controlled and carefully packaged meanings of Aboriginal heritage have underwritten aspects of urban Aboriginal presence and history that prevail in the (previously) colonial city. In the midst of the city which seeks to cling to selected images of its colonial past urban Aboriginal heritage emerges as a significant challenge to a largely ??white??, (post)colonial Australian heritage practice. The distinctively Aboriginal sense of anti-colonialism that underlines claims to urban sites of Aboriginal significance unsettles the colonial stereotypes that are associated with Aboriginal heritage and disrupts the ??purity?? of the city by penetrating the stronghold of colonial heritage. However, despite the challenge to the colonising imperatives of heritage practice, the fact that urban Aboriginal heritage continues to be a deeply contested reality indicates that heritage practice has failed to move beyond its predominantly colonial legacy. It knowingly or unwittingly maintains the stronghold of colonial heritage in the city by selectively and often with reluctance, recognising a few sites of contested Aboriginal heritage such as the Old Swan Brewery and Bennett House in Perth. Furthermore, the listing of these sites according to very narrow and largely Eurocentric perceptions of Aboriginal heritage makes it quite difficult for other sites which fall outside these considerations to be included as part of the urban built environment. Importantly this thesis demonstrates that it is most often in the case of Aboriginal sites of political resistance such as The Block in Redfern, the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Canberra and Australian Hall in Sydney, that heritage practice tends to maintain its hegemony as these sites are a reminder of the continuing disenfranchised condition of Aboriginal peoples, in a nation which considers itself to be postcolonial.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Urban</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Antiquities</field><field name="subject">Heritage</field><field name="subject">Postcolonial</field><field name="subject">Historic sites -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41460</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Telomeres and telomerase in haematopoietic progenitors and bone marrow endothelial cells</field><field name="creator">Schuller, Christine, Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">In normal human somatic cells, the length of telomeres (chromosomal end structures) decreases with each cell division until reaching a critically short length, which halts cell proliferation and induces senescence. The enzyme telomerase, which functions to maintain telomeres at a length that is permissive for cell division, is expressed in approximately 85% of cancer cells and some stem and progenitor cells, including haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), but not most other normal somatic cells. Previous investigations have demonstrated that ectopic expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) reconstitutes telomerase activity, resulting in telomere elongation in some normal human cell types. However, similar experiments performed in HPCs and endothelial cells have demonstrated a dissociation between the expression of telomerase activity and telomere lengthening. This thesis is focussed on further investigating telomerase-mediated telomere length regulation in HPCs and endothelial cells.  Short telomeres in bone marrow and blood leukocytes are associated with the development of disorders linked to bone marrow failure. However, to date a relationship between telomere length and myeloid cell proliferative potential has not been demonstrated. In the current investigations, the telomere length and proliferative potential of 31 cord blood-derived HPCs was determined. Regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between mean telomere length and erythroid cell expansion, but not expansion of other myeloid lineage cells. Another novel finding was that telomerase activity was upregulated in lineage-committed CD34- erythroid cells that were positive for the erythroid-specific lineage marker glycophorin A. It was also functionally demonstrated that telomerase activity facilitates the maximum expansion of erythroid cells.  To address the dissociation between telomerase activity and telomere maintenance in BMECs, a dominant negative mutant of the telomere binding protein TRF1, which functions to regulate telomere accessibility, was over-expressed in hTERT-transduced BMECs. These studies showed that telomere access, as well as oncogene expression and exposure to oxidative stress, contribute to telomere length regulation in BMECs. Overall, the results from these investigations demonstrate for the first time the functional significance of telomere length and telomerase activity in ex vivo expansion of erythroid cells, and provide novel insight to the molecular complexity of telomere length maintenance in endothelial cells.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Endothelial cells.</field><field name="subject">Telomeres.</field><field name="subject">Haematopoiesis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semiconducting properties of polycrystalline titanium dioxide</field><field name="creator">Burg, Tristan Kevin, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Titanium dioxide, TiO2, has potential applications as a photoelectrode for photoelectrochemical generation of hydrogen by splitting water using solar energy and as a photocatalyst for water purification. This study is part of the UNSW research program to process TiO2-based oxide semiconductors as high-performance photoelectrodes and photocatalysts. This study investigates the effect of defect disorder on semiconducting properties of polycrystalline TiO2.  This study involved the processing of high-purity polycrystalline TiO2 and determination of its semiconducting properties through measurement of electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power at elevated temperatures (1073-1323K) in controlled oxygen activities [1x10-13 Pa &lt; p(O2) &lt; 75 kPa].  The study included two types of experiments: Determination of electrical properties under conditions of gas/solid equilibrium. The data obtained was used to derive defect disorder and related semiconducting properties Monitoring of electrical properties during equilibration. This data was used to determine the chemical diffusion coefficient.  The data obtained under equilibrium conditions indicates that oxygen may be used as a dopant to impose controlled semiconducting properties. In reduced conditions TiO2 is an n-type semiconductor and under oxidizing conditions TiO2 is a p-type semiconductor. The n-type behaviour is associated with oxygen vacancies as the predominant defects and titanium interstitials as the minority defects. The p-type behaviour is closely related to titanium vacancies that are formed during prolonged oxidation. Charge transport at elevated temperature was shown to involve substantial contribution from ions.  Analysis of electrical properties enabled determination of several defect-related quantities including the activation enthalpy for oxygen vacancy formation, and the activation energy of the electrical conductivity components related to electrons, holes and ions.  The kinetic data obtained during gas/solid equilibration enabled determination of the chemical diffusion coefficient which exhibited a complex dependence on nonstoichiometry. In addition, prolonged oxidation showed that equilibration occurred in two kinetic regimes. One for highly mobile oxygen vacancies and titanium interstitials which quickly reached an ??operational equilibrium?? within hours and another slow kinetic regime for equilibration of titanium vacancies over many thousand hours. The determined chemical diffusion coefficient data may be used to select the processing conditions required to impose uniform concentration of defects within a TiO2.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diffusion</field><field name="subject">TiO2</field><field name="subject">Conductivity</field><field name="subject">Thermoelectric Power</field><field name="subject">Thermopower</field><field name="subject">Semiconductor</field><field name="subject">Defect</field><field name="subject">Polycrystalline semiconductors</field><field name="subject">Titanium dioxide</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unequal before the law: Questioning the distinction between types of armed conflict in international law</field><field name="creator">Crawford, Emily Jessica Teresa, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis makes the case for eliminating the distinction between types of armed conflict under international humanitarian law (IHL).  Currently, IHL makes the distinction between international and non-international armed conflicts.  International armed conflicts are regulated by more treaties than their non-international counterparts.  Furthermore, the regulation of international armed conflicts is also considerably more comprehensive than that offered for participants in and victims of non-international armed conflicts.  This bifurcation of the law was logical at the time the Geneva Conventions of 1949 were drafted and adopted, as the majority of armed conflicts prior to that point had been international in character.  However, in the years following the adoption of the Conventions, there has been a proliferation of non-international armed conflicts, which presents challenges to a body of law that has few tools to adequately address such occurrences.  The adoption of the Additional Protocols in 1977 went some way to addressing the legal lacunae that existed, but significant gaps still remain.  Mindful this history, this thesis tracks the growth and evolution of the laws of armed conflict in the modern era, since the first document of the laws of war produced for the American Civil War.  In doing so, this thesis demonstrates how the law of armed conflict has become increasingly harmonised in its application, with more rules of IHL being generally applicable in all instances of armed conflict, regardless of characterisation.  This thesis then makes the argument that the time has come for the final step to be taken, the elimination of the distinction between types of armed conflict, and the complete harmonisation of the laws of war.  Focusing specifically on the issue of combatants and POWs in armed conflicts, this thesis draws on considerable legal precedent, legal theory, and policy arguments to make the case that it is time for the law relating to the regulation of armed conflicts to be more uniformly applied.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Armed Conflict</field><field name="subject">International Humanitarian Law</field><field name="subject">International Law</field><field name="subject">War (International law)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineering antibodies against  complex platelet  antigens using phage display technology</field><field name="creator">De Leon, Ellen Jane, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Platelets are small anucleate cell fragments found in blood whose physiological role is important in maintaining haemostasis. In vivo, platelet surface glycoproteins mediate the mechanistic roles of platelets, and polymorphic changes to these glycoproteins have been observed to have significant effects on the platelet cellular function and such changes may include over-expression, under-expression and antigenicity of the protein. Human platelet antigens (HPA) are a result of polymorphic differences in platelet surface glycoproteins which have been found to be variably expressed in the population. Foetal maternal alloimmune thrombocytopaenia (FMAIT) is a condition that is observed in the unborn foetus and neonates due to HPA incompatibility between the mother and the foetus. HPA incompatibility accounts for a majority of severe thrombocytopaenic cases in neonates, and delayed diagnosis and treatment of such a condition often lead to intracranial haemorrhage. The risk in neonates diagnosed with FMAIT becomes increasingly significant in cases where intra-uterine (during pregnancy) platelet transfusion is the only effective therapeutic option. There are currently no antenatal screening programs for this condition, and laboratory diagnosis of FMAIT relies on the detection of maternal alloantibodies and parental HPA typing. For these reasons a significant amount of research is currently being invested into the isolation of recombinant antibodies with specific reactivity against FMAIT-related platelet antigens. Stable and specific recombinant platelet antibodies have great potential as a diagnostic agent in antenatal screening and broad-scale HPA typing of blood donors for platelet transfusion. Further characterisation of the isolated antibody may lead to a possible therapeutic agent. Studies by previous researchers have shown that the traditional methods (ie. Mouse monoclonal and EBV transformation) of obtaining monoclonal antibodies against FMAIT-related antigens have proven unsuccessful. The continuing progress in the discipline of phage display has produced several novel antibodies against self and non-self antigens. A further advantage in the application of phage display technology for the isolation of novel antibodies is the easy transition from bacterial to mammalian expression for the characterisation of glycosylated antibodies. The main focus of this project was to create and isolate a recombinant human anti-HPA-3a antibody using phage display for its possible application as a therapeutic or diagnostic agent.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phae display.</field><field name="subject">Human platelet antigens.</field><field name="subject">Antigen-antibody reactions.</field><field name="subject">Platelet activating factor.</field><field name="subject">Bacteriophages.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Face emotion recognition in children and adolescents; effects of puberty and callous unemotional traits in a community sample</field><field name="creator">Merz, Sabine, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Previous research suggests that as well as behavioural difficulties, a small subset of aggressive and antisocial children show callous unemotional (CU) personality traits (i.e., lack of remorse and absence of empathy) that set them apart from their low-CU peers. These children have been identified as being most at risk to follow a path of severe and persistent antisocial behaviour, showing distinct behavioural patterns, and have been found to respond less to traditional treatment programs. One particular focus of this thesis is that emerging findings have shown emotion recognition deficits within both groups. Whereas children who only show behavioural difficulties (in the absence of CU traits) have been found to misclassify vague and neutral expressions as anger, the presence of CU traits has been associated with an inability to correctly identify fear and to a lesser extend, sadness. Furthermore, emotion recognition competence varies with age and development. In general, emotion recognition improves with age, but interestingly there is some evidence that it may become less efficient during puberty. No research could be located, however, that assessed emotion recognition through childhood and adolescence for children high and low on CU traits and antisocial behaviour.	The primary focus of this study was to investigate the impact of these personality traits and pubertal development on emotion recognition competence in isolation and in combination. A specific aim was to assess if puberty would exacerbate these deficits in children with pre-existing deficits in emotion recognition. The effect of gender, emotion type and measure characteristics, in particular the age of the target face, was also examined. A community sample of 703 children and adolescents aged 7-17 were administered the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire to assess adjustment, the Antisocial Process Screening Device to assess antisocial traits, and the Pubertal Development Scale was administered to evaluate pubertal stage. Empathy was assessed using the Bryant Index of Empathy for Children and Adolescents. Parents or caregivers completed parent version of these measures for their children. Emotion recognition ability was measured using the newly developed UNSW FACES task (Dadds, Hawes &amp; Merz, 2004). Description of the development and validation of this measure are included.	Contrary to expectations, emotion recognition accuracy was not negatively affected by puberty. In addition, no overall differences in emotion recognition ability were found due to participant&#146;s gender or target face age group characteristics. The hypothesis that participants would be better at recognising emotions expressed by their own age group was therefore not supported. In line with expectations, significant negative associations between CU traits and fear recognition were found. However, these were small, and contrary to expectations, were found for girls rather than boys. Also, puberty did not exacerbate emotion recognition deficits in high CU children. However, the relationship between CU traits and emotion recognition was affected differently by pubertal status. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to future research into emotion recognition deficits within this population. In addition, theoretical and practical implications of these findings for the development of antisocial behaviour and the treatment of children showing CU traits are explored.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adolescence</field><field name="subject">Face emotion recognition</field><field name="subject">Antisocial behaviour</field><field name="subject">Childhood</field><field name="subject">Puberty</field><field name="subject">Emotional problems of children</field><field name="subject">Emotional problems of teenagers</field><field name="subject">Adjustment disorders in children</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neural drive to human respiratory muscles</field><field name="creator">Saboisky, Julian Peter, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the organisation of drive to human upper airway and inspiratory pump muscles.  The characterisation of single motor unit activity is important as the discharge frequency or timing of discharge of each motor unit directly reflects the output of single motoneurones.  Thus, the firing properties of a population of motor units is indicative of the neural drive to the motoneurone pool.  The experiments presented in Chapter 2 measured the recruitment time of five inspiratory pump muscles (diaphragm, scalene, second parasternal intercostal, and third and fifth dorsal external intercostal muscles) during normal quiet breathing and quantified the timing and magnitude of drive reaching each muscle.  Chapter 3 examined the EMG activity of a major upper airway muscle (the genioglossus).  The single motor units of the genioglossus display activity that can be grouped into six types based on its association or lack of association with respiration.  The types of activity are termed: Inspiratory Phasic, Inspiratory Tonic, Expiratory Phasic, Expiratory Tonic, Tonic, and Tonic Other.  A new method is presented in Chapter 4 to illustrate large amounts of data from single motor units recorded from respiratory muscles in a concise manner.  This single figure displays for each motor unit, the recruitment time and firing frequency, the peak discharge frequency and its time, and the derecruitment time and its frequency.  This method, termed the time-and-frequency plot, is used to demonstrate differences in behaviour between populations of diaphragm (Chapter 2) and genioglossus (Chapter 3) motoneurones. In Chapter 5, genioglossus activity during quiet breathing is compared between a group of patients with severe OSA and healthy control subjects.   The distribution of central drive is identical between the OSA and control subjects with the same proportion of the six types of motor unit activity in both groups.  However, there are alterations in the onset time of Inspiratory Phasic and Inspiratory Tonic motor units in OSA subjects and their peak discharge rates are also altered.  Single motor unit action potentials in OSA subjects showed an increased area.  This suggests the presence of neurogenic changes and may provide a pathophysiological explanation for the increased multiunit electromyographic activity reported in OSA subjects during wakefulness.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Obstructive sleep apnoea</field><field name="subject">Motoneurones</field><field name="subject">Breathing</field><field name="subject">Time and Frequency Plot (TAFPLOT)</field><field name="subject">Genioglossus</field><field name="subject">Diaphragm</field><field name="subject">Scalene</field><field name="subject">Parasternal intercostal</field><field name="subject">Dorsal external intercostal</field><field name="subject">internal intercostal</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42792</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of neutral posture on muscle tension, pain and performance for computer users</field><field name="creator">Dowler, Elizabeth , Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study focuses on developing a new approach to seated work positions. It was conducted on 67 office workers who use the Video Display Terminal (VDT) as a major function of their working day. Muscle tension was measured by surface electromyography when subjects were asked to adopt four selected working postures. Pain was measured before and after ergonomic intervention on the Nordic scale, which was modified for this study. Performance was measured on timed typing tests. A psychosocial questionnaire was used to determine influences of job demands, and a diagnostic assessment was performed to determine symptoms and pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions. Furniture was used to place subjects in desired positions during the clinical testing sessions and the extended intervention period. The chair seat pan was adjusted to a forward tilt to promote a lordotic curve of the low back, resulting in an erect upper body and upright head position. The desk and keyboard were adjusted to the proper height for each worker. A neutral wrist position was obtained by lowering and tilting the keyboard away from the user. Results revealed muscle tension scores in the upper trapezius and forearm extensors were significantly reduced when the workers were placed with the head in a midline position, with forward-tilting seating and with use of a negative sloping keyboard tray. Subjects reported low pain scores at pretest so no changes were noted after intervention. Loss of control over job elements, lack of job satisfaction, and fear of job loss were related to an increase in muscle tension. Only fear of job loss correlated to increased pain levels. There was no relationship between any of the job demand factors and performance.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Posture -- Physiological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Computer terminals -- Physiological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Muscle rigidity.</field><field name="subject">Video display terminals -- Safety measures.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capability building for the manufacture of photovoltaic system components in developing countries</field><field name="creator">Bruce, Anna Gabrielle, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The manufacture of photovoltaic (PV) system components has a role to play in the industrialisation and poverty reduction strategies of developing countries. It has also been suggested that small scale local manufacture of balance of systems components has the potential to improve the maintenance, installation and use of the technology. However, PV is a complex technology and most developing countries have not been able to build the capabilities required to manufacture PV system components of an appropriate quality and price, either in the modern or small scale sectors. The factors that determine the success of PV manufacturers in developing countries are therefore of interest.  Previous studies on learning in the PV industry have been focused on industry-wide concerns and have not explicitly addressed enterprise-level capability building or challenges specific to developing countries. In particular, there has been very little published about small scale PV manufacture. This thesis therefore aims to improve understanding of the factors that influence capability building, with a view to assisting decision making in relation to PV manufacture in developing countries.  The aims of the study have been fulfilled by the development and assessment of a software simulation training tool for PV cell production line engineers, the development of an analysis framework, and application of it to several case study PV enterprises. Through the application of the framework to the case studies, it has been possible to assess the role of software simulations, the suitability of countries with different types of infrastructure for hosting PV manufacturing and the institutional arrangements or interventions that could be used to promote capability building for PV manufacturers in developing countries.  While further case studies are required to make more than tentative conclusions, the framework developed and tested in this thesis may now be used as a tool to systematically and rapidly analyse the appropriateness of different types of PV manufacture in particular countries, to identify the weaknesses in their PV technological systems and therefore to suggest where resources should be invested and where appropriate institutional changes could be made. The simulation software has been demonstrated to be an effective capability building tool, thus providing one of the key elements required for successful manufacturing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Manufacture.</field><field name="subject">Photovoltaics.</field><field name="subject">Development.</field><field name="subject">Capability building.</field><field name="subject">Capacity building.</field><field name="subject">Technological systems.</field><field name="subject">Small-scale manufacture.</field><field name="subject">Simulation software.</field><field name="subject">Photovoltaic cells.</field><field name="subject">Photovoltaic power generation -- Developing countries.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41861</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pricing and hedging derivative securities in a regime-switching model with state-dependent jumps</field><field name="creator">Lee, Michael Shou-Cheng, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis we discuss option pricing and hedging under regime switching models.  To the standard model we add jumps of various types.  In particular, we consider a jump that is synchronous with a change in the regime state.  Thus, for example, we can define a process such that the stock price moves to a high volatility state and simultaneously has a large downward jump in returns.  This type of model is consistent with market experience.  We derive the compensator for our synchronous jumps and price options on such a price process using Fourier transforms.  We also test the model on S&amp;P futures options and show that it performs significantly better than a jump diffusion model.  Furthermore, we look at the problem of hedging options under finitely many regime states and with finitely many possible jump sizes.  We find risk-free hedge portfolios using the risk-free asset, the underlying asset, and finitely many options.  Our risk-free trading strategy is consistent with any equivalent martingale measure, and so does not in itself specify which measure should be used to price options.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hedging.</field><field name="subject">Regime-swiching.</field><field name="subject">Pricing.</field><field name="subject">Derivative.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How do Chinese print media in New Zealand present ideas of Chinese cultural identity?</field><field name="creator">Lin, David</field><field name="description">Two case studies examine and elaborate the idea of how the Chinese print media in New Zealand present Chinese cultural identity. The thesis examines the free Chinese newspapers given away in shops, supermarkets and other location where Chinese people gather. Do Chinese people use the media to maintain their cultural identity or to adapt to a new environment? The Chinese community in New Zealand is varied due to the diversity of its origins and the different stages at which its members have arrived. The Chinese in New Zealand show many differences in countries or regions of birth, languages, dialects, religions, values, behaviour and cultural identities. Little work has been done on Chinese print media in New Zealand. Many New Zealanders regard the Chinese community as homogenous. They do not know how many different kinds of Chinese newspapers there are in New Zealand and why Chinese migrants have so many of them. Chinese migrants in New Zealand group themselves after their arrival according to their origin, values, religions, dialects, and behaviours. Such varied groups of Chinese need their own papers to express their ideas, attitudes, values and argument. This study is intended to show how these varied newspapers reflect ideas about cultural identity in diasporic setting. Another important factor is how the Chinese print media react to an issue or social events and how readers respond. Chinese readers pick up the newspapers to read and discuss various controversial stories. People argue about important questions such as &#8220;who we are&#8221; &#8220;what we are doing here&#8221; and &#8220;what is our identity&#8221;. By studying these newspapers, we can gain insights into how the Chinese cultural identity is transformed by the experience of immigration.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Print</field><field name="subject">Media</field><field name="subject">NZ</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building research capacity for indigenous health : a case study of the National Health and Medical Research Council : the evolution and impact of policy and capacity building strategies for indigenous health research over a decade from 1996 to 2006</field><field name="creator">Leon de la Barra, Sophia</field><field name="description">Master of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Health and hygiene -- Research.</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Australians -- Medical care -- Research.</field><field name="subject">Public health -- Research -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Public health administration -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Iterative Receiver for MIMO-OFDM System with ICI Cancellation and Channel Estimation</field><field name="creator">Li, Rui</field><field name="description">Master of Engineering by Research</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MIMO,</field><field name="subject">OFDM</field><field name="subject">ICI Cancellation</field><field name="subject">Channel Estimation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical Algorithms for Maintaining Asthma Control</field><field name="creator">Sothirajah, Shobana</field><field name="description">Master of Science in Medicine</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">asthma control</field><field name="subject">eNO</field><field name="subject">exhaled nitric oxide</field><field name="subject">ICS</field><field name="subject">inhaled corticosteriods</field><field name="subject">down titration</field><field name="subject">dose titration</field><field name="subject">airway inflammation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3546</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te whatu o poutini: a visual art exploration of new media storytelling</field><field name="creator">Lee, Michelle</field><field name="description">This visual art project has explored the ancient Maori pukorero (oral tradition) of Te Whatu o Poutini (The Eye of Poutini) that articulates the journey of Poutini Taniwha, Waitaiki and Tamaahua from Tuhua (Mayor Island) in the Bay of Plenty, to the Arahura River.

From the past to the present, the biggest impact on iwi identity was colonisation and subsequent urbanisation. Urbanisation changed the foundation of identity largely due to the demographic rural-urban shift, effectively creating a distance physically and spiritually for M&#257;ori between their place of residence and their traditional tribal turangawaewae. Today a larger proportion of tribal members reside in the main urban centres of New Zealand and Australia. This phenomenon provides an ideal opportunity to explore how iwi identity is maintained in an urban setting &#8211; away from the traditional sites of cultural practice. The study, which focuses on Ng&#257;ti Awa members residing in Auckland, provided evidence that the foundation of an iwi identity is still heavily reliant on strong iwi-based wh&#257;nau. The corollary is that, strengthening the tribal knowledge base of wh&#257;nau residing in urban centres may require new or increased active participation in the customs and practices of their iwi. Regrettably, only three of the ten research participants had an in-depth knowledge of their whakapapa, histories and traditions. However, all the participants indicated the need to become more pro-active in creating and expanding on their knowledge base of iwitanga (including te reo). There was also acknowledgement that urban-based iwi marae and wh&#257;nau w&#257;nanga can provide individuals with the opportunities to learn more about their iwi traditions (and thereby reinforce their sense of tribal identity). Encouragingly, each participant confirmed that identifying as Ng&#257;ti Awa was important to them, largely due to the sense of belonging and identity. The study concluded that the sustainability of iwi is reliant on iwi members supporting their iwi regardless of the location of their upbringing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cultural identity</field><field name="subject">Maori identity</field><field name="subject">Maori research paradigm</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa a iwi approach</field><field name="subject">In-depth interview</field><field name="subject">Iwi, tribal, hapu identity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial Time Series Analysis using Pattern Recognition Methods</field><field name="creator">Zeng, Zhanggui</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Financial time series</field><field name="subject">Pattern recognition</field><field name="subject">Probabilistic relaxation clustering</field><field name="subject">Multi-scale pattern clustering</field><field name="subject">Principal component analysis</field><field name="subject">Bayesian classification</field><field name="subject">Principal component analysis</field><field name="subject">Independent component analysis</field><field name="subject">Object matching</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'The medical gaze and the watchful eye' : the treatment, prevention and epidemiology of venereal diseases in New South Wales c.1901 - 1925</field><field name="creator">Ussher, Greg</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">syphilis</field><field name="subject">gonorrhoea</field><field name="subject">venereal diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3565</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The origin of spring flights of Heliothis Punctigera Wallengren in South Australia</field><field name="creator">Learmonth, S.

In many of the cases concerning corporate scandals, many have taken place in developed nations, and authors have devoted much attention to investigating the possible causes, including those that analyse the problem from an individual&#8217;s ethical behaviour standpoint.As a developing nation, Malaysia has seen its share of corporate irregularities, and accusations of breaches of ethical conduct by those who have an interest in corporate transparency and governance have made local headlines. What factors or determinants influence an individual&#8217;s ethical behaviour would be useful in these cases, but a dearth of studies from a Malaysian context does not allow this analysis to take place.Therefore, the purpose of this exploratory study is to examine the impact of certain determinants on the perceptions of ethical behaviour of corporate managers in Malaysia. The demographic and situational determinants used in this study -- such as age, gender, level of education, and the presence of a code of ethics in the organisation -- are those commonly scrutinized in attempts to understand individual ethical behaviour.Information analysed quantitatively was obtained from a self-administered questionnaire distributed by e-mail to 750 individuals who are corporate managers in Malaysia.It is hoped that this study contributes to knowledge by assisting Malaysian managers to understand the factors that affect individual ethical behaviour and designing relevant policies and procedures that take the results of this study into account.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">business</field><field name="subject">ethics;</field><field name="subject">corporate</field><field name="subject">scandals;</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004420/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flawed nature cosmology</field><field name="creator">Pederson, Steven Patrick</field><field name="description">[Abstract]:  This thesis presents a new cosmological model based on a blank-slate reconsideration of the issue of the first cause in cosmology. It is proposed that a pre-Big Bang evolution of nature occurred that removes the need for postulating the existence of matter, energy and time. This new approach leads to an underlyingconceptualisation of nature consistent with quantum mechanics.The problems of first cause and initial conditions in cosmology are reconsidered. It is proposed that the initial conditions were flawed and evolved toproduce the Big Bang as a natural response to these flaws. This contrasts with the traditional approach of postulating a homogeneous initial state requiring perturbation by an additional first cause.In flawed nature cosmology the origin of time occurs as a natural response to the flawed set of initial conditions, and removes the need to postulate time. The development of causality remains an ongoing process rather than being fully determined by the first cause. Ongoing development of causality provides a conceptual understanding of the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and itsrelationship with classical physics.Flawed nature cosmology is used to examine pre-Big Bang evolution, in order to justify rather than postulate a set of conditions leading to the Big Bang. Thisexamination of pre-Big Bang evolution also introduces a structured method to start addressing the question of the origin of matter and the forces of nature.Flawed nature cosmology reconsiders the issues that introduced the manyuniverses concept into physics such as spontaneous first causes, the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, brane cosmology&#8217;s use of the extra dimensions in string theory, and parallel universes to solve the fine tuning problem. The manyuniversesconcept has found favour, as much of the puzzling behaviour of the universe can be avoided by simply stating that if there are many universes, one couldmatch our experience. In contrast, flawed nature cosmology demonstrates that the universe we experience is the unique product of its evolutionary history.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cosmology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004433/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of unfair dismissal grievance arbitration in Australia</field><field name="creator">Southey, Kim</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: This study identifies statistically significant associations between unfair dismissal arbitration decisions and inherent characteristics pertaining to the unfair dismissal claims. The inherent characteristics examined are the industry sector in which the employee worked, the occupational skill level of the employee&#8217;s position, size of the business, presence of human resource expertise within the business, the reason for dismissal, and the genders of both the employee and arbitrator. This research contributes to the body of knowledge on grievance activity within the workplace. It focuses specifically on arbitrated grievances and as such, AIRC unfair dismissal decisions are investigated as an exemplar of arbitrated grievance activity. This study is within an Australian context which may limit its world-wide generalisability but its strength is that it addresses across industry and across occupational data.Empirical analysis is undertaken using data collected from unfair dismissal arbitration decisions made by the AIRC during 2004 and 2005. Three hundred and eighty-four (384) cases are analysed, with 34.4% of the arbitration findings occurring in the grievant&#8217;s favour and 65.6% in the employer&#8217;s favour. It is noted that this figure is inflated in the employer&#8217;s favour because it includes cases lodged and later rejected by the commission for jurisdictional reasons. The split counting the 274 within jurisdiction cases is 51.8% in the employer&#8217;s favour and 48.2% in the grievant&#8217;s favour. The results of chi-square tests indicate that six characteristics have statistically significant association with the arbitration outcome. These characteristics are: occupational skill level of the grievant; the size of the business; the presence of HR expertise; the reason dismissed; the grievant&#8217;s gender; and the arbitrator&#8217;s gender. No association was found between the industry sector and arbitration decision, although there is a significant association between industry sector and jurisdictionally rejected claims.The collective finding of the hypotheses tests suggests that the type of aggrieved employee associated with a favourable arbitration outcome is one from an organisation of between 50 and 100 employees without an HR expert, working in a lower skilled occupation, having been made redundant, is female and appears before a male arbitrator. Whereas, the type of employer associated with a favourable arbitration outcome is one who has either up to 50 staff, or over 200 staff with an HR expert, who dismissed a male employee working in a higher skilled occupation for serious misconduct with the case before a female arbitrator.A major policy implication of this research relates to the Rudd government&#8217;s proposed legislative reforms of the unfair dismissal provisions. This study identifies disadvantaged groups of workers when it comes to dismissal practices of employers, namely employees from businesses of 50 to 100 workers and lower skilled workers. Identified also was the need for training for businesses to enable them to engage in procedurally fair redundancy processes and for gender bias awareness for arbitrators. In terms of further research, this study provides the foundation for predictive statistical analysis. The variables suitable for further analysis are occupational skill level, business size, reason for dismissal and gender in relation to their influence on the arbitration outcome. Additional descriptive research could also be conducted in terms of conducting international comparatives with a view to identifying the outputs that different legislation/arbitration frameworks produce for workers and employers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">unfair dismissal arbitration; unfair dismissal; arbitration; employment relations</field><field name="subject">industrial relations</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004435/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher leadership and organisational change: a teacher leader's experience in a P-12 school</field><field name="creator">Fisher, Jenny</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Crowther, Hann &amp; McMaster (2001) reported in School Innovation: Pathway to the Knowledge Society that when teacher leaders engage in collective action with theprincipal, they can build a school&#8217;s capacity to change. This Autoethnographic Case Study builds upon the findings reported by Cuttance (2001). The study uses a qualitativeinquiry approach to study a Participatory Action Research (PAR) project. The qualitative study was conducted in a P-12 school context in 2003 and contains two related microstudies. The study investigates how a teacher leader, occupying a formal role in an organisation, can contribute to the organisation&#8217;s capacity to change.Conducted by a participant observer, the study occurred within a single context, a P-12 school which contained two separate entities, a Primary School and a Secondary School.In the Secondary School, the self researcher occupied a formal position and performed functional tasks while in the Primary School, she exercised teacher leadership without being formally defined by that role. The task of coordinating an innovation to achieve mandated change was distributed to the self researcher by the principal. The self researcher&#8217;s efforts to improve her leadership practices while coordinating the innovation forms the basis of the study.The self researcher employed Participatory Action Research as a means to gather data and engaged in reflexive leadership practices to pursue socially just and moral ways ofacting in the social world. The organisational context provided the framework for the analysis of the data and various metaphors were employed to analyse the self researcher&#8217;s evolving subjectivities. The stance adopted by the self researcher is informed by criticaltheory, drawing from postmodern and poststructuralist perspectives, and the research question is answered through a narrative.This study found that teacher leadership underpinned by the principles of inclusion, participation and voluntarism is not sustainable in functionalist organisations. The study found that functionalist organisations are imprinted with the discourses of dominance and privilege and the distribution of functions by principals reproduces dominance and oppresses the emergence of teacher leadership.The study found that teacher leadership is emergent not distributed. The study found that when leadership is shared, parallel leadership practices generate organisational-wide leadership and build the collective&#8217;s capacity for change. However, the study concludesthat the context is important and for teacher leadership to contribute to an organisation&#8217;s capacity to change, the organisation itself has to be reimaged.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teacher</field><field name="subject">leadership;</field><field name="subject">organisational</field><field name="subject">change;</field><field name="subject">organizational</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004438/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Schools and the law: emerging legal issues internationally
with implications for school leaders in Singapore</field><field name="creator">Teh, Mui-Kim</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Singapore schools had encountered little involvement with legal issues in the past, and there had been a general feeling of complacency amongst educators that the situation was unlikely to change. Yet many English-speaking countries across the world had been experiencing increasing exposure to legal issues in their schools, and the question was whether Singapore was likely to share the same experience over time. Strong indications were beginning to appear that the situation was indeed changing, including a number of reported incidents in schools and evidence of changing attitudesamongst parents and educators.The study set out, therefore, to examine the types of legal issues that were emerging on the international scene, and particularly in the major jurisdictions withrelevance to Singapore, and to understand what the implications might be for Singapore. Thus, it was intended to identify the legal issues that seemed likely tobecome more prominent in the Singapore education system, to draw comparisons with events in other countries, and to examine the strategies that school leaders might adoptin order to manage legal risk effectively.This exploratory study used a mixed-method design, including document analysis and legal research, exploratory pilot interviews, in-depth interviews with verbatim transcription, and Q Methodology, which combined quantitative and qualitative techniques in order to interrogate and understand opinion. The study was conducted in four phases, moving from a broad survey of developments internationally, through a detailed analysis of issues in Singapore schools, to a deep understanding of the strategy preferences for coping with legal risk amongst senior educators. This then gave rise to aset of recommendations that could be used by policy makers and implementers, and by senior personnel in schools, to avert and manage legal risk and incidence in schools.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">schools;</field><field name="subject">law;</field><field name="subject">legal;</field><field name="subject">school</field><field name="subject">leaders;</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004439/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Broadcasting, democracy and localism : a study of broadcasting policy in Australia from the 1920s to the 1980s</field><field name="creator">Lane, Karen Lesley.</field><field name="description">Typescript.
