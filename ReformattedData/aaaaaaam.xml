This project describes the design a high quality CD player, at a low price, to compliment Perreaux's Silhouette series. A CD drive is selected over a proprietary optical pickup due to the former's low cost and the standardisation of the interface. The control circuitry includes a micro controller and discrete logic to provide the correct data and clock signals to the SPDIF transmitter and DAC circuits. These two circuits provided a high quality analogue output, and facilitate an upgrade path by connecting the SPDIF output to an external DAC.  After three board iterations, a final production ready revision was achieved. The design includes a high quality toroidal transformer, low jitter crystal oscillator, and a very high quality SPDIF pulse transformer output. The design also allows a remote input to control the player, and an optional digital cable via an RJ45 connector to provide synchronisation with a future design of the SXD2 DAC module, or to transmit SPDIF to a remote location.  The specifications of the final design were higher than expectations. The digital output boasts equal or superior performance to competitive products in the same price range, with the analogue output attaining exceptionally high performance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CD Player</field><field name="subject">Hi-Fi</field><field name="subject">Perreaux</field><field name="subject">Carl Benton</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rugby, School Boys and Masculinities: In an American School in Taiwan.</field><field name="creator">Vicars, Andrew Grant Fairbairn</field><field name="description">Gender research throughout the last two decades has positioned sport as one of the central sites in the social production of masculinities.  In particular, body contact, confrontational sports have been identified as central to the reproduction of a dominant but problematic form of masculinity, typically known as hegemonic masculinity.  Whether it is through participation, opposition, resistance, complicity or media consumption, contact sports have been identified as constructing individual understandings of masculinity as well as contributing to the continued marginalization and subordination of other types of masculinities.  Researchers working within schools have also linked rugby to similarly negative understandings of masculinities.  The majority of these school based studies have been conducted in countries where contact sports are traditionally respected or in schools where rugby is tied to traditional and institutionalized understandings of masculinity.  As yet little attention has been paid to boys who play rugby in countries or schools where rugby is not tied to traditional and institutionalized understandings of masculinity.  As a New Zealand teacher working in an American school, in Taiwan, I set out to examine the rugby experiences of high school boys and to investigate the influence that rugby has on their understanding of masculinities.  My study employed in-depth interviews with seven boys.  Cognizant of the fact that the majority of gender based sport research has utilised Connell's theory of hegemonic masculinity, I adopted a 'Foucauldian method' to analyse the data.  In doing so it was my intention to contribute to the field of sport and gender studies by utilising an alternative perspective instead of creating repetitive and redundant research which could lead to some problems being explored exhaustively.  My main findings revealed a number of dominant discourses surrounding and constituting rugby within the American School of Taiwan.  These included discourses of rugby as a masculine sport, as a foreign/western sport, and as a low status sport.  Drawing upon these discourses I examined how the participants' gendered subjectivities were influenced by their rugby participation. The results revealed that within the general context of the school, rugby players were generally regarded as low status male athletes.  However, within the western cultural group of students, rugby players were regarded as high status male athletes.  This study contributes to gender and sport studies by suggesting that contact sports such as rugby need not always contribute to structured and hierarchical understandings of masculinities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">masculinities</field><field name="subject">rugby</field><field name="subject">school</field><field name="subject">boys</field><field name="subject">taiwan</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2385</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genocide Prevention through Changing the United Nations Security Council Power of Veto</field><field name="creator">Butters, Michelle</field><field name="description">In 1948 the international community in reaction to the horrors of the holocaust sought to eradicate genocide forever by creating the 'Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide'.  This Convention criminalised the preparation and act of genocide by international law, making all individuals accountable irrelevant of status or sovereignty.  But the Convention has not been enough to deter the act of genocide from occurring again, and again, and again.  Worst, the international community has been slow to react to cases of genocide.  The problem with preventing and punishing genocide is hindered by the power and right of veto held by permanent members of the UNSC.  The UNSC has been given the responsibility to maintain international peace and security and is the only entity that can mandate an intervention that overrides the principle of non-intervention. The aim of this thesis is to show that the veto has been a crucial factor in stopping the prevention of genocide, thus it is imperative that the veto change.  This study argues that to effectively prevent and punish genocide the veto needs to be barred from use in cases of genocide.  It looks at different cases since the Armenian genocide during WWI through to the Darfur genocide which is still in process.  The case of Armenia is significant because for the first time, members of the international community were prepared to hold leaders of another state accountable for their treatment of their own citizens.  However the collective will to bring justice to those accountable waned coming to an abrupt end in 1923.  The holocaust followed in WWII; six million Jews died, and numerous other groups were targeted under the Nazi's serial genocide.  The shock of the holocaust led to the Genocide Convention.  But thirty years later during the Cold War, Cambodia became embroiled in a genocide perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge.  The international community silently stood by.  The USSR, China, and the US all had their reasons to stay out of Cambodia, from supporting a regime with a likeminded political ideology to war weariness from Vietnam.  In the 1990s, genocides in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia (Bosnia and Kosovo) followed.  The former was neglected by the US's unwillingness to be involved in another peacekeeping disaster.  The two genocides in the former Yugoslavia were affected by Russia and China's reluctance to use military force even after the clear failure of serial negotiations.  Finally, in 2003 Darfur became the latest tragedy of genocide.  Again, Russia and China have been timid of calling the conflict genocide thus avoiding any affirmative action to stop it.  These cases all show that where one state is unwilling to be involved in stopping genocide, their right and power to the veto stops or delays the international community from preventing and punishing genocide, regardless of whether the veto is used or merely seen as a threat.  Therefore, for future prevention of genocide, the veto needs to be changed to prevent its use in times of genocide.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genocide</field><field name="subject">genocide prevention</field><field name="subject">United Nations Security Council</field><field name="subject">veto</field><field name="subject">veto power</field><field name="subject">Armenian genocide</field><field name="subject">holocaust</field><field name="subject">serial genocide</field><field name="subject">Khmer Rouge</field><field name="subject">Cambodian genocide</field><field name="subject">Rwandan genocide</field><field name="subject">genocide in former Yugoslavia</field><field name="subject">Bosnian genocide</field><field name="subject">Kosovo genocide</field><field name="subject">Darfur genocide</field><field name="subject">Sudan genocide</field><field name="subject">Russia</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">United States of America</field><field name="subject">Britain</field><field name="subject">France</field><field name="subject">power politics</field><field name="subject">permanent member states</field><field name="subject">United Nations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School cultural features and practices that influence inclusive education in Papua New Guinea: A consideration of schools in Southern Highlands Province.</field><field name="creator">Rombo, John Longo</field><field name="description">Inclusive education is a recent phenomenon in the education system in Papua New Guinea. It is about giving equal educational opportunities to all children, whether with disabilities or not in the regular school or classroom.  Schools are considered as social institutions that should endeavour to enhance all children's lives through appropriate teaching and learning practices.  However, the school culture, which is generally defined as 'how things are done here' is vital for the promotion of inclusive practices. The main aim of this study was to identify the school cultural features and practices that influenced or did not influence inclusive education, and the impact on inclusion.  Teachers and school administrators appeared to play a vital role in enhancing inclusive practices through their practices.  The study was based on an interpretive/naturalistic research paradigm, the qualitative research approach and the case study methodology. Four schools were studied and categorised as rural and urban settings. The main purpose of categorisation was to identify some similarities and differences in terms of how inclusion was promoted in these schools. Teachers and school administrators were chosen as the main participants. The primary source of data collection was semi-structured interviews. Interview questions were developed for both teachers and school administrators respectively.  A non-participant observation method was used as a support instrument to collect more data from selected research participants based on the preliminary interview data.  The results suggested the existence of four broad school cultural features and practices. These included staff understanding of special and inclusive education concepts, leadership and organisation, school cultural features/practices and implications for staff, and policies.  Teachers and school administrators appeared to have limited knowledge and understanding about what constitutes special and inclusive education practices. However, the school leadership, collaboration and inspection practices minimally influenced inclusive practices. At the same time other school cultural features such as the outcomes-based education curriculum and ecological assessment seemed to have the potential to influence the outcomes of the process of inclusion.  The results suggest the value of Callan Services as a school support service agency to influence inclusive education in the Southern Highlands Province. It was noted that children with disabilities were already part of the education system. Though the teachers and school administrators claimed this to be inclusive education, according to the literature this was a manifestation of functional mainstreaming practices.  The teachers and school administrators and the Department of Education at the provincial and national levels appeared to take less responsibility in disseminating information pertaining to inclusive practices. The teachers and school administrators received limited support and information from the national and provincial Departments of Education.  Therefore, the special education policies developed at the national level had not trickled down to the school level.  This situation created a gap between inclusive education policy and practice. One of the major channels of communication and connection was through the inspectors and their inspection practices, but this appeared to have been under-utilised.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">school culture</field><field name="subject">inclusive education</field><field name="subject">southern highalnds province</field><field name="subject">papua new guinea</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards Colour Imaging with the Image Ranger</field><field name="creator">Muttayane, Anandajothi</field><field name="description">Many of the colour images captured by different types of digital camera do not provide quality colour image according to human visual perception. In this study we explore technique for colour correction of the colour images from the Waikato Image Ranger. Colour images were captured using three different illuminants with the Waikato Image Ranger. The colour image formed from the ranger data do not have good quality because illuminants used do not match usual RGB standard illuminants. The spectral power distribution values of the illuminants were measured using spectroradiometer. To calculate tristimulus values the reflectance function of the scene is required. A mechanism of calculating the reflectance functions from the ranger data using genetic algorithm was explained. The reflectance functions are approximated using variable Gaussian basis functions, and fit to the ranger colour triplets by genetic algorithms. From the estimated reflectance functions standard CRT RGB values were calculated. It was found that the genetic algorithm approach was for too slow for practical purposes and produced images with far too much colour variation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Colour imaging</field><field name="subject">Image ranger</field><field name="subject">Reflectance recovery</field><field name="subject">Genetic Algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2388</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stress, Health, and Mindfulness: Exploring Relationships and Mechanisms Using Self-Report Measures</field><field name="creator">Foster, Kristal Claire</field><field name="description">The relationship between stress and physical health has been well established in the medical and psychological literature. Mindfulness meditation is a practice that has been successfully used to reduce stress in several populations, and the construct itself has recently begun to be measured as a naturally occurring characteristic. A recent study demonstrating the significant relationships between mindfulness, stress, and physical health prompted the investigation in the present study of the possible mechanisms underlying these relationships. It was hypothesised that the relationship between mindfulness and physical health would be largely mediated by stress, and that in addition, mindfulness would explain a significant proportion of the variance in health after stress had been accounted for. Participants were 129 undergraduate students who completed a battery of self-report questionnaires including the Perceived Stress Scale, the Short-Form 36 Health Survey, and two recently developed measures of mindfulness; the Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale and the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills. Perceived stress was shown to account for a large proportion of the relationship between mindfulness and health, and mindfulness was also shown to explain a significant proportion of the variance in physical health after stress had been controlled for. An additional finding was that acceptance demonstrated stronger relationships with both physical and mental health than any of the other components of mindfulness studied. Potential mechanisms of mindfulness that may help explain these findings are discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">mindfulness</field><field name="subject">KIMS</field><field name="subject">MAAS</field><field name="subject">SF-36</field><field name="subject">PSS</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2389</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Childhood Obesity Prevention: A Parent Administered Behavioural Intervention to Increase Child Physical Activity</field><field name="creator">Howarth, Joelene Marie</field><field name="description">Obesity is a complex and increasingly prevalent health disorder that is associated with a wide range of medical, social, and psychological difficulties. People are more likely to be obese if they consume an energy dense diet but do not engage in physical activity. Research has indicated that interventions, when implemented during childhood, have long-term outcomes that are superior to interventions implemented in adulthood. This research piloted a behaviourally based intervention programme, with parents as the agents of change, to promote a lifestyle change for inactive children. The programme focussed on increasing physical play (lifestyle activity) and on decreasing sedentary behaviour (an obesity promoting behaviour) during children's after school leisure time. The intervention was investigated using three case studies. Although no conclusive evidence was gained regarding the effectiveness of the pilot programme there was some evidence that children participating reduced their amount of sedentary behaviour and increased the amount of time they spent in physical play. There was also evidence that parents were able to administer the programme and that they found it useful. The results from the present study suggest that the development and application of parent administered behavioural programmes, in the form of packaged interventions to prevent child obesity, warrant further investigation both in terms of the benefits and costeffectiveness it could offer parents and practitioners alike.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chilhood Obesity Prevention</field><field name="subject">Parent administered intervention</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2390</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teachers' views on providing for children with special needs in inclusive classrooms:a papua new guinea study</field><field name="creator">Mapsea, Allan Jim</field><field name="description">The purpose of having inclusive education is to value children with special needs so they can participate equally in all educational activities alongside their peers without special needs. There should not be any discrimination, segregation or isolation of these children with special needs from being educated rather they must be given an equal opportunity to participate alongside children without special needs.  This study seeks to investigate primary school teachers' views and experiences in implementing the Inclusive Education Policy in regular schools. The study was conducted in five districts of the Enga Province of Papua New Guinea. Six primary schools were selected and involved 77 teachers who responded to questionnaire items, while 12 teachers within the group were chosen to be involved in interviews. Data for the study were gathered and analysed from the questionnaires, and the interview transcripts.  The findings from the study revealed that most teachers supported the notion of Inclusive Education Policy and would like to implement it. However, they indicated that there needed to be a change in attitudes of teachers, peers, boards of management, and parents/caregivers to provide assistance for children with special needs. Most teachers felt that there needs to be more awareness of the principle and the importance of inclusion. Teachers' limited knowledge of teaching children with special needs was also highlighted. In this study teachers admitted they needed more training in the field of educating children with special education in order to accommodate and teach children with special needs. This shows that teachers' colleges and universities need to have trained lecturers to develop more courses in special education. Teachers expressed concern that school inspectors do not know enough about the inclusive education concept and need to be trained as well so collaboratively they could implement the policy. Government support is needed to effectively implement the inclusive education policy. This includes training of specialists to support teachers, funds for teaching and learning resources and facilities in schools.  The cultural implications and geographical issues have also had some impact on the implementation of the Inclusive Education Policy, while the issue of children with HIV and AIDS was raised that teachers needed to be prepared in order to accommodate and teach those infected children.  All these issues highlighted are very important and it is hoped that the outcome of the findings will provide the Department of Education with new strategies to improve and strengthen their commitment to implement Inclusive Education Policy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">iclusive eucation</field><field name="subject">history of special education in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">special education policies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Change in Local Places: the experince of a peri urban community</field><field name="creator">Wright, Jason John</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT  This thesis explores change in place, and particularly the social tensions that arise from change in peri-urban communities. In this study, a review of relevant literature indicates that rural/urban fringe areas are dynamic places, as pressure for the conversion of rural land uses to rural residential function creates social and economic anxiety. With pressure for change, tensions between people, both inside and outside of the local community become more clearly articulated, as change for some members of the community is an un-welcomed progression. Others, who may have no association with the local community, grasp the opportunity for change, particularly if financial return is the end reward. This study considers various approaches to the analysis of these changes in place and develops a methodology that reveals the social dimension of change, and more particularly the tensions associated with shifting land use patterns and changing demographic characteristics in the peri-urban location of Matangi.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Change</field><field name="subject">peri urban</field><field name="subject">local place</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community understanding and preparedness for tsunami risk in the eastern North Island, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pishief, Katharine Sophie</field><field name="description">The Indian Ocean tsunami on 26 December 2004 made many New Zealanders more aware of the devastating affects that a tsunami can have on coastal communities, and highlighted the need for people living in the coastal zone to be prepared for natural hazard events. The east coast of New Zealand is at high risk from both local and distantly generated tsunami, and Poverty Bay and Hawke Bay have been identified among the most at risk areas from tsunamis in the country. Three surveys were conducted between January and November 2006 to assess community understanding of, and preparedness for tsunami risk in the eastern North Island, New Zealand. These surveys were a camping ground visitor survey; a tourism sector preparedness survey; and the 2006 National Coastal Survey. Findings of all three surveys show that the general public does not appear to have sufficient knowledge of tsunami risk in their area. Also, there does not appear to be adequate information on tsunamis available to the public. Understanding of official tsunami warnings was high amongst residents surveyed in the 2006 National Coastal Survey. However, it was low amongst visitors surveyed in the camping grounds, with the majority of camping ground survey respondents indicating that they do not know what makes up the New Zealand public notification system. It is encouraging to find that overall the public are aware of the correct actions to take in the event of a tsunami warning being issued. Staff in hotels/motels in the Napier area were not well prepared for managing natural hazard events, with the majority of respondents having no training for dealing with emergencies, and none of those who had received training had received training for tsunami hazards. It is recommended that steps be taken to better educate and prepare the public and tourism managers in eastern North Island communities. This will require not only public education but a range of activities that engage, empower and motivate at-risk communities to respond effectively and appropriately to tsunami warnings.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tsunami</field><field name="subject">preparedness</field><field name="subject">understanding</field><field name="subject">resilience</field><field name="subject">Napier</field><field name="subject">Gisborne</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">natural hazards</field><field name="subject">2006 national coastal survey</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2393</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Potential for Re-Invasion by Mammalian Pests at Maungatautari Ecological Island</field><field name="creator">Connolly, Trevor Allan</field><field name="description">Mammalian pests are excluded from Maungatautari Ecological Island by an XcluderTM pest-proof fence. Inevitably, the fence integrity will be compromised at some point by mechanisms such as treefall and flood-scour: such events could lead to pest re-invasion. Knowledge of pest activity directly outside the reserve would assist reserve managers in developing optimal breach-response procedures. This thesis described baseline data on the presence, timing of activity and behaviour of mammalian pest animals found directly at the Maungatautari fence. Two seasonal video studies investigated the effects of season (summer and winter), exterior habitat (forest and pasture) and simulated breach type ('tree-fall' and 'flood scour') on the number of pest sightings. Significantly more sightings were recorded in summer (788) than in winter (428), particularly for rodents. Rabbits were sighted significantly more often at pasture sites, but habitat type did not significantly affect sightings of any other species; nor did breach type affect sightings of any species. Ship rats were commonly sighted within the fence hood gutter. Overall, rodent, possum and cat sightings were very high, and mustelid sightings extremely low, in both seasons. Over 95% of non-lagomorph sightings were nocturnal, and the greatest threat of invasion was found to come nocturnally, from mice, and in the summer. A probability model showed that although the cumulative probability of a mammalian pest encountering a fence breach increases dramatically after dark, in reality there is always a threat of encounter, and this is always increasing with time. Over the same two studies, the behaviour of pest mammals sighted was also described. Pests were found to show interest in and enter summer breaches more often than winter breaches (p lt 0.001). Simulated breaches were encountered by pests within the first 24 hours at a very high rate (95% summer, 92.5% winter), and most likely to enter a breach were rodents. Over 7 days, breaches were encountered and entered by increasing numbers of species and possibly by more individuals; all species were shown to be willing to enter. The threat of invasion by ship rats was probably underestimated because of their higher activity within the fence hood than at the fence base; mustelids may also offer a greater threat than the results suggest, because they almost always entered a breach. It was strongly recommended that when the fence integrity is compromised, physical response should be as quick as possible, especially at night. Future research was strongly encouraged, particularly to understand invasion behaviour of animals such as ship rats and stoats, and to describe pest behaviour at real breach events.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maungatautari</field><field name="subject">pest-proof fence</field><field name="subject">mammalian pests</field><field name="subject">pest-free reserve</field><field name="subject">Xcluder</field><field name="subject">invasion</field><field name="subject">pest eradication</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Confidence and competence? The capacity of New Zealand Boards of Trustees to appoint highly effective school principals</field><field name="creator">Morrison, Michele</field><field name="description">Academics and lay persons alike freely acknowledge that principals exert enormous influence over the creation, maintenance and enhancement of the learning environment in schools. They recognise that a turbulent educational world presents principals with multiple challenges in sustaining the conditions necessary for student achievement, and that some principals are more successful in this endeavour than others. This small-scale qualitative study uses a semi-structured interview process to gather data from five Chairpersons of Boards of Trustees who have appointed a principal within the preceding twelve months. The study discusses the professional capabilities that theoretical and empirical research suggests distinguish highly effective principals from capable performers. It adopts a bipartite approach to the literature, examining both academic understandings and the degree to which available official publications inform the thinking of Boards of Trustees prior to embarking on the principal appointment process. The study then explores the extent to which these understandings influence the decision-making of five Boards of Trustees in appointing a new principal. Research findings reveal a dichotomy between the theory underpinning concepts of highly effective principals and the practice of Boards of Trustees in appointing a principal. Largely unaware of the academic literature and inadequately informed by official publications, Boards of Trustees adopt a problematic generic recruitment and selection process. Uncritical acceptance of the professional knowledge and standing of external consultants and misplaced trust in the advice they proffer leads Boards to proceed on a questionable perceptual basis. Secure in the knowledge that they have obtained the educational expertise they freely acknowledge they lack, Boards are further exposed to prevailing market discourses and internal prejudices which undermine their ability to identify and appoint a principal who possesses the capabilities necessary to exercise highly effective, contextually specific leadership. This study suggests that the autonomy of Boards of Trustees in their role as employer be sustained but supported through the mandatory appointment of an appropriately qualified advisor and that the involvement of existing advisors be further scrutinized.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">school principals</field><field name="subject">Boards of Trustees</field><field name="subject">principal appointment</field><field name="subject">highly effective principals</field><field name="subject">leadership capabilities</field><field name="subject">leadership learning</field><field name="subject">advisors</field><field name="subject">managerialism</field><field name="subject">contextually specific leadership</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2395</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Man from the Future: Traces of Masculinity and Modernity from Hamilton in the 1960s.</field><field name="creator">Rule, Jeffrey Bryan</field><field name="description">This research offers a reading of the considerable change to the landscapes of cities, masculinities and bodies that occurred after the Second World War. With an emphasis on visual sources and methods, I consider how a distinctly modern post-war identity emerged out of the interaction between Hamilton's newly (re)built cityscape, human bodies and their gendered identities. In the 1960s, rapid urban growth in Hamilton produced a large number of buildings designed in the Modernist style. This concrete language rendered public structures, and the city at large, as distinctly 'Modern' and progressive. The existence of these buildings was essential to Hamilton's transition from a rural town to an urban centre. Meanwhile, the 1964 Centennial served as a convenient narrative of progress to (re)create the city as Modern while remaining youthful and vibrant. Images of the past and the future were regularly and publicly invoked. Colonial Pioneers and Men from the Future were rhetorically exhumed and conceived in order to (re)construct Hamilton. Material and discursive spaces of the cityscape were inhabited by images of a 'citified' Modern Man: the fabled Businessman and his derivatives. Images of masculine bodies offer an insight into constructions of gendered identity. Their 'suited' and impervious bodily boundaries reflect the rigid confines of 1960s masculinities and the firm geometric designs of Modernist buildings. Analysis of advertisements and photographs reveal bodily performances that maintain this identity while establishing an urban and masculine corporeality. A number of 'other' identities were excluded by dominant urban masculinity and offer areas for future research.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">modernity</field><field name="subject">Hamilton</field><field name="subject">1960s</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">male</field><field name="subject">masculine</field><field name="subject">civic</field><field name="subject">city</field><field name="subject">businessman</field><field name="subject">businessmen</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface oscillation in peatlands: How variable and important is it?</field><field name="creator">Fritz, Christian</field><field name="description">Hydrology, particularly the water table position below the surface, is an mportant control on biogeochemical and ecological processes in peatlands. The position of the water table is a function of total storage changes, drainable porosity and peatland surface oscillation (PSO). Because the absolute level of the peat surface (ASL) oscillates in a peatland, we can assign two different water table positions: the water table depth below the surface (relative water level, RWL) and the water table position above an absolute elevation datum eg. sea level (absolute water level, AWL). A review of 37 studies that report peatland surface oscillation indicate awide range (0.4-55 cm), which is to the same order as (or one order smaller than) water storage changes and RWL fluctuations. PSO can vary substantially across a single peatland and through time. A set of mechanisms (flotation, compression/shrinkage, gas volume changes and freezing) is hypothesised to cause ASL changes. The potential of PSO to reduce RWL fluctuations trended (mean in %) floating peatlands (63) greater than bogs (21), fens (18) greater than disturbed peatlands (10) with respect to peatland types. To investigate the spatiotemporal variability of peatland surface oscillation, AWL and ASL were monitored continuously over a one-year period (one site) and monthly (23 sites) in a warm-temperate peatland that is dominated by Empodisma minus (Restionaceae). A new measurement method was developed by pairing two water level transducers, one attached to a stable benchmark (AWL) and one attached to the peat surface (RWL). From August 2005 until August 2006 the ASL oscillated at one site through a range of 22 cm following AWL fluctuations (in total 47 cm). Consequently, RWL fluctuations were reduced on average to 53% of AWL fluctuations. The strong AWL-ASL relationship was linear for 15 sites with manual measurements. However, eight sites showed significantly higher rates of peatland surface oscillation during the wet season (ie. high AWLs) and thus a non-linear behaviour. Temporary flotation of upper peat layers during the wet season may have caused this non-linear behaviour. On the peatland scale AWL fluctuations (mean 40 cm among sites) were reduced by 30-50% by PSO except for three sites with shallow and dense peat at the peatland margin (7-11%). The reduction of RWL fluctuation was high compared to literature values. The spatial variability of PSO seemed to match well with vegetation patterns rather than peat thickness or bulk density. Sites with large PSO showed high cover of Empodisma minus. Surface level changes exhibited surprisingly hysteretic behaviour subsequent to raised AWLs, when the rise of ASL was delayed. This delay reversed the positive ASL-AWL relationship because the surface slowly rose even though AWL started receding. Hysteresis was more pronounced during the dry season than during the wet season. The observed hysteresis can be sufficiently simulated by a simplistic model incorporating delayed ASL fluctuations. PSO has wide implications for peatland hydrology by reducing RWL fluctuations, which feed back to peat decomposition and plant cover and potentially to (drainable) porosity. Stable RWL also reduce the probability of surface run-off. It is further argued that the gas content of the roots of plants, particularly Empodisma minus, added enough buoyancy to detach the uppermost peat layers resulting in flotation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrology</field><field name="subject">peatlands</field><field name="subject">peatland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Composition Portfolio</field><field name="creator">Mayall, Jeremy Mark</field><field name="description">The works in this portfolio of original compositions cover a wide spectrum of genres, styles, approaches, and musical techniques. The aim was to demonstrate mastery of the various musical languages and techniques characteristic of each genre. The calculatedly low-fi 'alt.rock meets computer games' approach of the concept album They No Longer Sleep Alone is of folk-like simplicity, deliberately eschewing the various polishing processes available to producers now in the digital mastering situation. The intention was to preserve a naturalness of sound and song making. On the other hand, live electronic effects are utilized to expand the sonorities and textures obtained from a solo bassoon in The Effect of Bundled Sticks on Sounds. Today is the Tomorrow takes this idea further, being a completely electronic work mixing live musical performance (turntables) with pre-recorded sounds, these interacting with live video and prepared animation. De Feo, inspired by graffiti artists, was written for a virtuoso pair of performers in the unusual combination of alto saxophone and viola, with no electronics being required. The Big Fat Jazz Bastard Theme Song and Espacio were written for particular performers and approaches to music making, while Saturday Afternoon and Late Night Specials are film scores. Swamp Treasures and Bungamucka - the Alarmist were commissioned for theatrical productions and thus were designed to fulfil specific functions determined by the stage directors.

The SIP method utilises an isotopically-labelled substrate and PCR techniques to discern the members of a microbial community that incorporate the isotope into their DNA or RNA. The current literature gap around using 15N isotopes with RNA-SIP offers real potential and advantages for targeting and identifying active members from mixed communities involved in global biogeochemical nitrogen cycling. This study specifically investigated whether nitrogen based compounds can be used as substrates in RNA-SIP methodologies and whether they can in turn be used to probe mixed community environments known to be actively fixing nitrogen. The nitrogen-limited systems targeted represented an ideal opportunity to assess the suitability of 15N-RNA-SIP approaches due to their known high nitrogen fixation rates. Identifying these nitrogen-fixing bacteria could provide a better representation analysis of the community, leading to an improved prediction on how to manage and optimise the treatment performance of target waste systems and to exploit the unique bioconversion properties of these types of organisms. Initially, the project undertook methodological proof of concept by using a soluble nitrogen source, 15NH4Cl, to label the RNA of Novosphingobium nitrogenifigens and a mixed microbial community. Successful separation of the 14N- (control) and 15N-RNA was achieved for both pure and mixed communities using isopycnic caesium trifluoroacetate (CsTFA) gradients in an ultracentrifuge. The usefulness of this technique to identify active diazotrophs in real environmental samples was tested using a nitrogen-fixing community from a pulp and paper wastewater treatment system. After growing the mixed culture with 15N2 as the sole nitrogen source, the labelled RNA was extracted and fractionated using isopycnic centrifugation in CsTFA gradients. The community composition of the active nitrogen-fixing community in the 15N2 enriched fraction was analysed by establishing a 16S rRNA gene clone library containing over 200 members. These were analysed by comparison with published sequences and by phylogenetic analysis. It was found that the more isotopic label substrate incorporated, the further the buoyant density (BD) separation between 15N- and 14N-RNA. Novosphingobium nitrogenifigens gave an average BD shift of 0.03 + 0.004 g ml-1 (95.0 atom % 15N) with 15NH4Cl. For mixed communities the average BD shift was 0.02 + 0.004 g ml-1 (80.0 atom % 15N) with 15NH4Cl and 0.013 + 0.002 g ml-1 (32.6 atom % 15N) when using 15N2. Clone library analysis of 16S rRNA genes present in the enriched 15N-RNA fraction of the mixed community was shown to consist of a diverse population of bacteria as indicated by a Shannon Weaver index value of gt;2.8. Three dominant genera (Aeromonas, Pseudomonas and Bacillus) were identified by comparison with published sequences and phylogenetic analysis. Many other groups not known as archetypal nitrogen-fixing bacteria were also identified, demonstrating that 15N2-RNA-SIP provides a useful tool for the identification of important and previously unknown contributors to nitrogen fixation in a range of environments. Overall, this project has established that nitrogen based RNA-SIP is a powerful tool that can be used successfully and reproducibly with both pure and complex mixed microbial communities to study active diazotrophs in environmental samples.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stable isotope probing</field><field name="subject">community diversity</field><field name="subject">pulp and paper wastewaters</field><field name="subject">biological nitrogen fixation</field><field name="subject">RNA</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2399</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adsorption of Colour from Pulp and Paper Mill Wastewaters onto Diatomaceous Earths</field><field name="creator">Carter, Shane Basil</field><field name="description">Abstract  Production of pulp and paper from raw wood involves the washing of substantial quantities of highly coloured material from the wood pulp. Although most of this colour is trapped within the mill and the mills wastewater treatment system, discharge of coloured wastewater remains a problem of public concern.  Lake Rotorua, New Zealand is filled with sediment consisting almost exclusively of diatoms. The most abundant species, Aulacoseira, has been shown to have very small pores, less than 200 nm, that could be very useful for the capture and holding of large organic molecules. Lake Rotorua is situated close to the two largest pulp and paper mills in New Zealand and may have to be dredged to solve a problem of eutrophication. Wastewaters generated at the Kinleith (Tokoroa) and Tasman (Kawerau) mills in the North island of New Zealand have been used to assess the characteristics of colour removal by Lake Rotorua diatoms.  Vacuum filtration through the diatoms succeeded in removing colour but proved to be impractically slow as an industrial process. Addition of diatoms to wastewater streams in stirred experiments showed that significant adsorption took place. The majority of the colour was removed within 30 seconds of mixing. The efficiency of colour removal was found to vary between wastewater streams within the mills. The pH dependency of this removal was tested and found to be most effective in a pH range of 3.6 to 5.  Attempts to reuse the diatoms showed that chemical backwash regimes were more effective than calcination.  This study concluded that surface silanols were likely to be the principle agent in forming coagulants with the colour material and were subsequently trapped on the diatom surfaces, but more importantly within the pores.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adsorption of colour</field><field name="subject">Pulp and Paper Mills</field><field name="subject">Pulp and Paper colour</field><field name="subject">Diatomaceous earths</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design, Implementation and Evaluation of a Mobile Exhibition Guide</field><field name="creator">Chen, Jingyu Chen</field><field name="description">As mobile devices are increasingly merging into our daily lives, exhibition ser- vices are also facing innovation based on the newly available technologies. Our project addresses these new circumstances. We developed a mobile exhibition guide for the exhibition called quot;Mrs Brown's Big Day Out: Hamilton Women in the 1950squot;. That is organized by the Waikato Museum. The proposed sys- tem re-uses the TIP(Tourist Information Provider) system's framework and provides information via mobile devices to visitors on Victoria Street, which is an outdoor part of the exhibition. The information about a sight will be delivered according to visitors' current locations and their interests. We would also like to examine the possibility of re-using our TIP system within the application area of exhibition guide. Therefore, we built the mobile exhibition guide system under the TIP system's framework and developed corresponding services that tailored the system to the requirements of visitors and the exhibition organizer. During the development, we faced a number of challenges, especially, modeling the unknown and unstructured exhibition data into the TIP database. The development process as well as the implementation and evaluation are detailed in this report.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mobile guide</field><field name="subject">mobile exhibition guide</field><field name="subject">TIP</field><field name="subject">Tourist information provider</field><field name="subject">location-aware</field><field name="subject">time-context</field><field name="subject">museums</field><field name="subject">museum</field><field name="subject">exhibition guide</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Newspaper Coverage of People with Disabilities: A New Zealand Perspective</field><field name="creator">Wall, Stacey Lee</field><field name="description">Throughout history the science of mass communication has been a topic of public and academic interest. In the past 3 decades portrayals of various minority groups have been of concern to researchers, health professionals and member of these groups. This study examines how people with disabilities are portrayed within the New Zealand print media and whether or not a traditional (often negative) or progressive (often positive) modes of representations predominate in coverage. Progressive focus views disability and the problems surrounding it as being located in society's failure to accommodate all members of the population. In contrast, traditional focus views people with disabilities as dysfunctional because he or she is unable to function in an environment designed by or for people without disabilities. The research corpus comprises relating to intellectual and physical disabilities and people with disabilities published in three major newspapers of New Zealand; The New Zealand Herald, The Dominion Post and The Sunday Star Times between the 1st of June and the 1st of August 2006 (N=101). These articles were collected and the content of each article was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Aspects such as structure, content, terminology, sources used and attributes assigned to the people with disabilities were analysed within each article as a means of determining whether an article was positive, negative or neutral. Results show that within the New Zealand print media disability is generally portrayed in a positive or neutral manner. Moreover, it was discovered that Clogston's (1989) classifications of traditional and progressive focus were problematic because results indicated that a traditional mode of focus was dominate but this did not reflect a negative portrayal of disability. This may have been due to the disparities between the findings of this thesis and previous research conducted in other countries over a decade ago. Furthermore, it was found that the main source within each article was the government and this supported past research (Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien, 1980).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="subject">Newspaper coverage</field><field name="subject">People with disabilities</field><field name="subject">New Zealand disability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clustering for Classification</field><field name="creator">Evans, Reuben James Emmanuel</field><field name="description">Advances in technology have provided industry with an array of devices for collecting data. The frequency and scale of data collection means that there are now many large datasets being generated. To find patterns in these datasets it would be useful to be able to apply modern methods of classification such as support vector machines. Unfortunately these methods are computationally expensive, quadratic in the number of data points in fact, so cannot be applied directly.  This thesis proposes a framework whereby a variety of clustering methods can be used to summarise datasets, that is, reduce them to a smaller but still representative dataset so that these advanced methods can be applied. It compares the results of using this framework against using random selection on a large number of classification and regression problems. Results show that the clustered datasets are on average fifty percent smaller than the original datasets without loss of classification accuracy which is significantly better than random selection. They also show that there is no free lunch, for each dataset it is important to choose a clustering method carefully.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clustering</field><field name="subject">Classification</field><field name="subject">Large Datasets</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The educational and career aspirations of Solomon Island's parents for their children</field><field name="creator">Beuka, Rose Doumou</field><field name="description">This study used the qualitative semi-structured interview method to collect data to discover Solomon Islands parents' educational and career aspirations for their children and their perceptions of formal secondary education in the Solomon Islands with respect to their children's preparation for meeting these aspirations. In carrying out the research, four couples were selected as participants and categorized into two groups according to their educational attainment (well educated and less educated). What was found was that, although parents have educational and career aspirations for their children, not all parents were specific. The findings also suggested that the career aspirations parents have were mainly influenced by economic and social factors rather than internal factors. In relation to parents' perception of the formal secondary education system in terms of preparing students for work, the findings suggested parents have both a positive and low opinion of formal secondary education in the Solomon Islands. There was also a mixed feeling and point to the idea that there are other factors such as teachers and curriculum subjects that impacted on the perceptions of success or vice-versa of the secondary education system. The findings also suggested that while parents appreciate the vocational curriculum and education system as preparing students for work (than secondary education), preference however was given to secondary education first and foremost.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Solomon Islands</field><field name="subject">careers</field><field name="subject">perceptions</field><field name="subject">work</field><field name="subject">aspiration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of trust in an effective school culture</field><field name="creator">Colville, Kathryn Adeline</field><field name="description">Much work and research has been carried out on effective school cultures, accountability and relationships. Underlying all that happens in schools, is the notion of trust. But what do we understand about trust? Is the definition of trust consistent amongst everyone? How is trust defined? Is trust a valued or even an identified component of successful leadership? Does trust underpin all that we do and what, if any, are the commonalities of trust?  Central to this thesis is the notion that trust and trusting relationships play a pivotal role in the culture of a school and that without trust a school ceases to be as effective as it has the potential to be. The purpose of this study was to consider existing research and information and to attempt to establish a definition of trust, while identifying the place that trust is perceived to have in an effective school culture. While seeking to establish a baseline understanding of trust and peoples' perceptions of trust, it was also the purpose of this study to examine the dichotomy of trust and accountability. This looked at the challenge of building and maintaining trust while meeting individual and school accountability tasks. Consideration was also given to high-trust/low-trust situations and to whether they are actually the same situation, just seen through different eyes. The literature review examined what an effective school culture might look like and how trust impacts on this culture and, ultimately, on student learning. The literature review also defined trust and the skills, actions or emotions which contribute to trust and for whom these aspects of trust are a reality. The understanding that trust in the school situation is based on having common values and goals was evident in the literature. Trust was defined as being critical in the role of leadership and it is inherent in the way that principals act and lead and that it impacts greatly on the effectiveness of the relationships within a school and on student learning. Eight principals from a range of school sizes, with a gender balance of participants, took part in this research. All were involved in separate, semi-structured interviews, which provided the data for grounded theory analysis. Three distinct findings emerged from this process. These were the notion of what it means to be trustworthy, the role of the principal in extending trust and the dichotomy of trust. The results of this qualitative study suggested that the modelling of trust through daily actions and the empowering of staff were found to be important aspects in developing and maintaining trust within schools as was the competence, experience and knowledge of the principal.  Walking the talk  and valuing staff as individuals as well as professional members of the school organisation, were critical aspects to effective leadership. Prior experiences in which low trust was evident, informed the practice of these principals to develop philosophies of high trust. Within the final chapter in the Recommendations for Further Study which could add to current research by considering in more depth, specific relationships involving high trust. Six recommendations for further study were discussed in this final section. 	This study concludes that trust is significant in effective school cultures. It is a fragile emotion and action that can quickly be undermined and decimated and conversely, needs to be actively worked on to be maintained and developed to a high trust model. Being aware of and considering trust will assist principals and their colleagues to enhance effective school cultures, which will impact positively on student learning outcomes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trust</field><field name="subject">benevolence</field><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">vulnerability</field><field name="subject">honesty</field><field name="subject">reliability</field><field name="subject">competency</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oil Spills in New Zealand's Territorial Waters:        Fence at the Top of the Cliff?</field><field name="creator">Hoeberechts, Veronica Anne</field><field name="description">Over the last four decades, there have been many catastrophic oil spills in the marine environment and these larger oil spills have often caused environmental devastation especially if they occurred in the coastal marine area.   Serious ecological damage can also be caused from operational discharges, ballast and bilge water, from ships within territorial waters.  Until now New Zealand has only had relatively minor oil spillages in its coastal waters, primarily from ships' discharge or accidental leaks in port.   The possibility however of a major oil spill occurring within our coastal area is considerably higher today than 20 years ago as there has been a significant increase of all types of oil tankers/bulk carriers/container ships to New Zealand.  New Zealand is an island nation that relies heavily on the marine environment for commercial operations such as fisheries and tourism and many New Zealanders enjoy recreational, aesthetic and spiritual ties to the coastal marine area.  The sustainability of our territorial sea is therefore of paramount importance.  A major oil spill could cause widespread ecological damage, cripple or destroy marine/tourism operations and ensure that the human values associated with the coast are lost, possibly for many years.  The research reported here addresses the issue of oil spill preparedness and response in New Zealand's waters.  A combination of a review of New Zealand's international commitments and domestic legislation and two case studies of high profile oil spills: the Poor Knights Islands Marine Reserve and the Jody F Millennium are used.   The research identifies whether the present environmental legislation, that promotes sustainable management, is proactive in the prevention of a major oil spill and concludes that the New Zealand approach reflects a relatively strong Sustainable Imperative position rather than one of Sustainable Development.  In implementation it relies heavily on co-management integrated at the regional council level.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oil Spills</field><field name="subject">Coastal Marine Environment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">International MEA's and National Legislation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an Ion Chromatography Method for the Analysis of Nitric Acid Oxidation Reactions of Common Sugars</field><field name="creator">Davey, Cara-Lee</field><field name="description">The large scale nitric acid oxidation of common sugars into their corresponding aldaric acids is being investigated as an important source of potentially useful components for industrial applications such as polymers. This thesis details the development of an Ion Chromatography (IC) method for the analysis of these oxidation mixtures and related samples from the work-up and purification processes. The method was developed for use with a Dionex ICS2000 IC system equipped with an AS11-HC column and utilising suppressed conductivity detection. IC proved to be a useful, versatile and straightforward method of studying the reactions and their products. The detected ions include but are not restricted to the anionic salt forms of: D-Glucaric acid, Xylaric acid, Mannaric acid,  D-gluconic acid and both keto forms of the same, D-xylonic acid, D-mannonic acid, glycolic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid and tartronic acid. Nitrate from the nitric acid used in the oxidation is often observed.  The results compare favorably to GC-MS and HPLC analysis of similar samples. An overview of the theory and operation of the instrument along with the method development and results from application to the oxidation mixtures and related samples are presented. As part of the investigation into the range of utility of IC for studying these reactions, a study was made of the retention behaviour of a large number of simple and low molecular weight (LMW) carboxylic acids eluted by the ion chromatography system in use.

The Voice of Waitaha, A Forgotten People.</field><field name="creator">Reese, Alistair William</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of Waitaha, a Bay of Plenty iwi that has been marginalized through the loss of most of its land, much of its language, tikanga, and mana. The purpose of the work is to communicate, through the 'voice' and the history of the people, a chronicle, of their alienation to a P&#257;keh&#257; audience that remains in large part ignorant and distant from their plight. The thesis is motivated by an academic responsibility to the Treaty of Waitangi and the lack of understanding to the present needs of M&#257;ori as evidenced for example, by the support for the January 2004 Orewa speech, by the leader of the National Party, Don Brash. It is predicated upon the understanding that this response, which minimalises the impact of colonization upon M&#257;ori, is constructed by many, through a convenience of distance. It is motivated also on the understanding that most P&#257;keh&#257; who now inhabit the rohe of Waitaha, are completely ignorant of the identity of tangata whenua. It is hoped that the presentation of the Waitaha story, will provoke a greater empathy from P&#257;keh&#257;, and thereby facilitate an environment, whereby grievances can be addressed in an environment of greater understanding. The thesis is a qualitative based research exercise, carried out in consultation with kaum&#257;tua and other Waitaha members, and attempts to acknowledge and integrate current kaupapa M&#257;ori epistemologies with traditional Western academic methodology. The study uses interviews, Waitangi Tribunal evidence, and other historical references to construct a narrative that conveys something of the 'voice' of Waitaha. Specifically, it outlines a chronology of Waitaha settlement, followed by a description of their encounter with P&#257;keh&#257;, the consequent alienation of the majority of their lands by the Crown, and concludes, with a glimpse into the current circumstance of Manoeka, the papakainga of Waitaha.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">maori</field><field name="subject">land alienation</field><field name="subject">maori land</field><field name="subject">iwi history</field><field name="subject">treaty of waitangi</field><field name="subject">encounter history</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding Chinese international students' gambling experiences in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Li, Wendy Wen</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This research investigated Chinese international students' gambling experiences in New Zealand. It explored why some students become involved in gambling and how their gambling behaviour changes over time. Initial and follow-up interviews were conducted with nine male and three female students. Initial interviews focused on participants' gambling biographies in China and New Zealand. Cultural influences on their gambling experiences, and possible links between the development of gambling problems and their study experiences in New Zealand, were discussed. Follow-up interviews gathered further information on participants' gambling experiences, paying particular attention to their gambling activities over the six months prior to, and then after, the initial interviews. The methodology and analysis in this study were informed by a narrative approach. Findings suggest that Chinese international students rarely reported that they had problems relating to gambling in China.  However, some participants in this study presented as problem gamblers in New Zealand.  Study shock, acculturation stress, not feeling welcomed by the host society and achievement anxiety, all played a part in participants' problem gambling in New Zealand. These participants claimed that they usually started gambling recreationally, but then gradually shifted to self-reported problem gamblers. Problem gamblers were distinguished by prolonged gambling hours, wagering greater amounts of money, an augmented craving for winning money, and an inability to stop gambling at will in a single session. In this study, many participants who might have a gambling problem, had achieved some success in changing their gambling behaviour. Filial piety, acknowledgement of the importance of family, peer models, the experience of success, and financial hardship were some of the catalysts for stopping gambling. In addition, support from families, the community, professional services and exclusion programmes also assisted participants to address problems related to gambling. Successful re-rooting in New Zealand is significant in participants' post-change life. Positive post-change lifestyles involving aspects such as spirituality, music, study and work, supported Chinese international students to maintain change. This research demonstrates multiple levels of analysis, which adds to our knowledge about the socio-cultural meanings of gambling among Chinese international students. A number of recommendations are made for preventing and reducing the negative consequences of gambling for students.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gambling</field><field name="subject">Chinese international students</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Socio-cultural factors</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Overview of Indonesian Islamic Education: A Social, Historical and Political Perspective</field><field name="creator">Zakaria, Rusydy</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to examine how the historical genealogy of Islamic educational tradition, particularly the tradition of teaching and learning, has contributed to the development of Islamic education in Indonesia. By drawing together in an analytic way a historically based description of the social and political circumstances surrounding Indonesian Islamic education, the study discusses some significant issues concerning the religious base, knowledge base, structural form, and the pedagogical approach of Indonesian Islamic education, all of which are important to the development of a modern form of Islamic education.  The argument of the thesis is that the existing values of the Islamic tradition in education, particularly evident in Madrasah schools, provide a valuable basis for further developing and reconstructing an effective Islamic education system in Indonesia. However, there is also a strong need to construct an Islamic education curriculum in Indonesia that can meet the challenge posed by the circumstances generally understood as 'modernity'. The quality of teaching and learning in the Madrasah are very much influenced by the quality of the wider Islamic education programme. Any change in the curriculum of Islamic education will thus have significant effects on the quality of the Madrasah schools in Indonesia. This thesis will thus conclude by suggesting some implications for further development of Islamic education that arise from the study.  This is a qualitative study using an historical genealogical approach to discover, understand and analyze the challenges currently facing Islamic education In Indonesia. The techniques for collecting data involved, primarily, a critical reading of historical and contemporary policy documents.

This small group of islands is situated near the eastern margin of the Chatham Rise, an elongated section of submerged continental crust that represents part of the Late Paleozoic-Mesozoic Gondwana accretionary margin.  The location and much of the geology of the Chatham Islands are attributed to intra-plate basaltic volcanism, initiated during the Late Cretaceous, in association with development of a failed rifting system to the south of the Chatham Rise.  Despite the volcanic nature of much of the geology, the majority of the Cenozoic sedimentary stratigraphic record on the islands comprises non-tropical skeletal carbonate deposits whose deposition was often coeval with submarine volcanics and volcaniclastic deposits.  This has resulted in complex stratigraphic relationships, with the volcanic geology exerting a strong influence on the geometry and distribution of the carbonate deposits.  These limestones, despite some general field descriptions, have been little studied and are especially poorly understood from a petrographic and diagenetic perspective. The carbonate geology in detail comprises eleven discrete limestone units of Late Cretaceous through to Pleistocene age which were studied during two consecutive field expeditions over the summers of 2005 and 2006.  These limestone occurrences are best exposed in scattered coastal outcrops where they form prominent rugged bluffs.  While many of the younger (Oligocene to Pliocene) outcrops comprise of poorly exposed, thin and eroded limestone remnants (it;5 m thick), older (Late Paleocene to Early Oligocene) exposures can be up to 100 m in thickness.  The character of these limestones is highly variable.  In outcrop they display a broad range of textures and skeletal compositions, often exhibit cross-bedding, display differing degrees of porosity occlusion by cementation, and may include rare silicified horizons and evidence of hardground formation. Petrographically the limestones are skeletal grainstones and packstones with a typical compositional makeup of about 70% skeletal material, 10% siliciclasts, and 20% cement/matrix.  Localised increases in siliciclastics occur where the carbonates are diluted by locally-derived volcaniclastics.  The spectrum of skeletal assemblages identified within the Chatham Island limestones is diverse and appears in many cases to be comparable to the bryozoan dominant types common in mainland New Zealand and mid-latitude Australian cool-water carbonates in general.  However, some key departures from the expected cool-water carbonate skeletal makeup have been identified in this study.  The occurrence of stromatolitic algal mats in Late Cretaceous and Early Eocene carbonate deposits indicates not cool-temperate, but certainly warm-temperate paleoclimatic conditions.  A change to cool-temperate conditions is recorded in the limestone flora/fauna from the mid-Late Miocene times following the development and later northward movement of the Subtropical Front.  An uncharacteristic mix of shallow-shelf (bryozoans) and deeper water fauna (planktic foraminifera), together with their highly fragmented and abraded nature, is indicative of the likely remobilisation and redistribution of carbonate, primarily during episodic storm events. The Chatham Islands limestones formed within the relative tectonic stability of an oceanic island setting, which was conducive to ongoing carbonate accumulation throughout much of the Cenozoic.  This contrasts markedly with other mainland New Zealand shelf carbonates which formed over sporadic and short-lived geological periods, experiencing greater degrees of burial cementation controlled by a relatively more active tectonic setting.  As a consequence of the tectonically stable setting, the Chatham Islands limestones have experienced little burial and exhibit a paucity of burial cementation effects.  They remain commonly soft and friable.  Detailed petrographic investigations have shown the limestones are variably cemented by rare uneven acicular spar fringes, poorly to well-developed syntaxial rim cements about echinoderm fragments, and equant/blocky microsparite.  Staining of thin sections and cathodoluminescence petrography show these spar cement generations are non-ferroan and their very dull- to non-luminescent nature supports precipitation from Mn-poor oxygenated waters, likely of an either meteoric or combined marine/shallow burial origin.  Micrite is the dominant intra- and inter-particle pore fill and occurs both as a microbioclastic matrix and as precipitated homogenous and/or micropeloidal cement.  The rare fringing cements often seen in association with homogenous and/or micropeloidal micrite may be indicative of true early marine (seafloor) cement precipitation and localised hardground development. An interesting feature of the geology of the Chatham Islands is the occurrence of carbonate material within sedimentary dykes.  The locations of the dykes are in association with volcanic and volcaniclastic deposits.  Similarities between dyke characteristics at Red Bluff on Chatham Island with mainland occurrences from East Coast and Canterbury Basins (North and South Islands, respectively) on mainland New Zealand have been recognised.  They show complex structures including sidewall striations, internal flow structures as revealed by grain sorting, and extra-clast inclusions of previous fill lithologies which are characteristic of carbonate injection.  This is in contrast to other dykes which are known to be of a passive fill origin.  Multiple phases of carbonate sediment injection can be recognised by crosscutting relationships enabling the determination of a parasequence of events.  Possible injection mechanisms are most likely associated with sediment overloading or hydrothermal pressurisation associated with emplacement of submarine volcanics. The Chatham Islands provide an exciting example of a geologically unique and complex non-tropical carbonate depositional setting.  The production of carbonates is controlled by volcanic and volcaniclastic sediment input with the types of carbonate deposits and water depth variations related to thermal uplift/subsidence in association with global eustatic sealevel and temperature changes associated with development of Southern Ocean water fronts from the Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic.  Carbonate deposition on the Chatham Islands is considered to relate to a rather variable and small scale oceanic, high energy, cool-water carbonate ramp setting whose geometry was continually evolving/changing as a consequence of periodic volcanic episodes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chathams Islands</field><field name="subject">Chatham Rise</field><field name="subject">carbonate</field><field name="subject">limestone</field><field name="subject">sedimentary dyke</field><field name="subject">limestone dyke</field><field name="subject">clastic dyke</field><field name="subject">injection</field><field name="subject">passive fill</field><field name="subject">intra-plate basaltic volcanism</field><field name="subject">submarine volcanics</field><field name="subject">skeletal assemblege</field><field name="subject">bioclastic</field><field name="subject">microbioclastic</field><field name="subject">micrite</field><field name="subject">syntaxial overgrowth</field><field name="subject">epitaxial rim</field><field name="subject">acicular fringing cement</field><field name="subject">early marine cementation</field><field name="subject">meteoric diagenesis</field><field name="subject">shallow burial</field><field name="subject">cool-water carbonates</field><field name="subject">temperate</field><field name="subject">non-tropical</field><field name="subject">hargrounds</field><field name="subject">bryomol</field><field name="subject">bryozoan dominanted</field><field name="subject">nannofor</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">southwest Pacific Ocean</field><field name="subject">Subtropical Front</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Institutional responses to mental deficiency in New Zealand, 1911-1935: Tokanui Mental Hospital</field><field name="creator">Hoult, Adrienne</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the response of one New Zealand institution, Tokanui Mental Hospital, to legislation and policies for 'mental deficiency' introduced during the first half of the twentieth century. Institutional reactions to these policies have been under examined in New Zealand. While psychiatric or mentally ill patients have been the subject of a number of New Zealand histories of the asylum, 'mental defectives' have often been overlooked. Yet during the early-twentieth century, 'mental defectives' were thought to be a source of a number of social problems, and the New Zealand government considered a range of measures aimed at limiting the spread and effect of mental deficiency in society. Policies for 'mental deficiency' were influenced by contemporary anxieties about crime, sexuality and hereditarism. As a policy of segregation was formally prescribed, more 'mental defectives' were committed to mental hospitals and other institutions than ever before. An understanding of the responses to this perceived problem also provides an insight into wider social policies in New Zealand in the first half of the twentieth century. This thesis argues that gender was a significant factor in the decision to commit mental defectives to Tokanui. Subsequent categorisation and treatment within Tokanui was also affected by gender. Official reports inform us about the policies that were in place, and historical materials from Tokanui show how these worked in practice. Most of the archives of Tokanui Mental Hospital have been unexamined by historians before now, and close analysis of patient cases also reveals more about institutional practices. The connection between Tokanui and neighbouring Waikeria Prison is also explored, in the context of contemporary fears surrounding mental deficiency and crime.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mental deficiency</field><field name="subject">Tokanui</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shelf-to-slope sedimentation on the north Kaipara continental margin, northwestern North Island, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Payne, Danielle Sarah</field><field name="description">Temperate mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sediments and authigenic minerals are the current surficial deposits at shelf and slope depths (30-1015 m water depth) on the north Kaipara continental margin (NKCM) in northern New Zealand. This is the first detailed study of these NKCM deposits which are described and mapped from the analysis of 54 surficial sediment samples collected along seven shorenormal transects and from three short piston cores. Five surficial sediment facies are defined from the textural and compositional characteristics of this sediment involving relict, modern or mixed relict-modern components. Facies 1 (siliciclastic sand) forms a modern sand prism that extends out to outer shelf depths and contains three subfacies. Subfacies 1a (quartzofeldspathic sand) is an extensive North Island volcanic and basement rock derived sand deposit that occurs at less than 100-200 m water depth across the entire NKCM. Subfacies 1b (heavy mineral sand) occurs at less than 50 m water depth along only two transects and consists of predominantly local basaltic to basaltic andesite derived heavy mineral rich (gt30%) deposits. Subfacies 1c (mica rich sand) occurs at one sample site at 300 m water depth and contains 20-30% mica grains, probably sourced from South Island schists and granites. Facies 2 (glauconitic sand) comprises medium to fine sand with over 30% and up to 95% authigenic glauconite grains occurring in areas of low sedimentation on the outer shelf and upper slope (150-400 m water depth) in central NKCM. Facies 3 (mixed bryozoan-siliciclastic sand) consists of greater than 40% bryozoan skeletal material and occurs only in the northern half of the NKCM. Facies 4 (pelletal mud) occurs on the mid shelf (100-150 m water depth) in northern NKCM and comprises muddy sediment dominated by greater than c. 30% mixed carbonatesiliciclastic pellets. Facies 5 (foraminiferal mud and sand) contains at least 30% foraminifera tests and comprises two subfacies. Subfacies 5a consists of at least 50% mud sized sediment and occurs at gt400 m water depth in southern NKCM while subfacies 5b comprises gt70% sand sized sediment and occurs at mid to outer shelf and slope depths in the northern NKCM. vi A number of environmental controls affect the composition and distribution of NKCM sediments and these include: (1) variable sediment inputs to the NKCM dominated by inshore bedload sources from the south; (2) northerly directed nearshore littoral and combined storm-current sediment transport on the beach and shelf, respectively; (3) offshore suspended sediment bypassing allowing deposition of authigenic minerals and skeletal grains; (4) exchange between the beach and shelf producing similar compositions and grain sizes at less than 150 m water depth; and (5) the episodic rise of sea level since the Last Glaciation maximum approximately 20 000 years ago which has resulted in much sediment being left stranded at greater depths than would otherwise be anticipated. Sedimentation models developed from other wave-dominated shelves generally do not appear to apply to the NKCM sediments due to their overall relative coarseness and their mosaic textural characteristics. In particular, the NKCM sediments do not show the expected fining offshore trends of most wavedominated shelf models. Consequently, sandy sediments (both siliciclastic and authigenic) are most typical with mud becoming a dominant component in southern NKCM sediments only at greater than 400 m water depth, over 350 m deeper than most models suggest, a situation accentuated by the very low mud sediment supply to the NKCM from the bordering Northland landmass.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">north Kaipara continental margin</field><field name="subject">glauconite</field><field name="subject">phosphate</field><field name="subject">sedimentation</field><field name="subject">sedimentation model</field><field name="subject">mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sediments</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategies and characteristics of effective one-to-one literacy tutors</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Tracey Shelley-Anne</field><field name="description">What makes an effective one-to-one tutor of literacy is unclear.  Researchers (Anand  Bennie, 2004; Chapman, Tunmer,  Prochnow, 1999; Holland, 2004; Oliver, 2000) in New Zealand have investigated the effectiveness of one-to-one tutoring programmes; however there are very few studies on tutor effectiveness especially in the context of New Zealand education.  The present New Zealand study explored the strategies that effective one-to-one tutors of literacy used as well as the observed and perceived characteristics distinctive to effective one-to-one literacy tutors.    Three effective tutors were observed at the Hamilton Children's Reading Centre during their regular tutoring with two of their tutees over a period of four weeks.  To determine the strategies used and the characteristics distinctive to the three tutors, tutoring sessions were audio-tape recorded, and observational notes were recorded.  The time spent engaged in various teaching activities was recorded and tutors were required to comment on the successes and challenges of the session in a journal entry after each tutoring session.  Individual and group interviews with the tutors were conducted to gain further insight into observational data and journal entries.   Numerous strategies were identified during observations of the three effective tutors; the use of these strategies was further explored during individual and group interviews.  The majority of each one-to-one tutoring session focused on the teaching of direct letter-sound relationships, listening to tutees read, and phonemic awareness activities.  Open questions were asked more frequently than closed questions.  Tutees were praised frequently.  Scaffolding was observed regularly throughout tutoring sessions.  The effective tutors used Questioning as their most frequent type of help and used Demonstrating least frequently.  High levels of engaged teaching were maintained throughout tutoring sessions.  A higher percentage of words were spoken by the effective tutors than the tutees.  Written planning did not appear to play a role in the effectiveness of the tutor.  Role reversal was a strategy used frequently by one of the effective tutors. Effective tutors used a variety of ways to motivate tutees to read, complete homework, and remain on task.  Many characteristics of effective tutors were revealed during observations and journal entries.  The perceived characteristics of effective tutors were explored during interviews with the three tutors.  The ability to establish positive, caring relationships appeared to play a major role in the tutees' learning and confidence.  The tutors believed being responsive to tutees' emotional needs was the most important characteristic of an effective tutor.  The tutors ensured that the sessions were positive and laughter was frequently observed.  Good communication was maintained with parents and tutees.  The effective tutors were flexible during tutoring sessions, yet consistent with routines.  The three effective tutors were knowledgeable and experienced in working with children experiencing reading difficulties.  They believed effective tutors are aware of their tutees' areas of greatest need, understand their tutee, and maximise all teaching opportunities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reading</field><field name="subject">tutor</field><field name="subject">effective tutors</field><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">tuition</field><field name="subject">strategies</field><field name="subject">characteristics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Turnover Intentions: The Mediation Effects of Job Satisfaction, Affective Commitment and Continuance Commitment</field><field name="creator">Riley, Derek</field><field name="description">Retention and productivity levels of a workforce are one of the essential ingredients for organisations to prosper in today's competitive business environment.  Turnover intentions of the workforce are an important consideration for managers of organisations, employees, families, and communities alike.  This study investigated a comprehensive model of turnover intentions that included two proximal variables, (job satisfaction, and organisational commitment), the distal variables of organisational justice, work strain, work overload, and work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict with the turnover intentions.  A questionnaire was completed by 114 participants of the Allied Health workforce at the Waikato District Health Board, from allied health occupational groups, psychologists, physiotherapists, social workers, dieticians, and speech language therapists.  Job satisfaction, affective commitment, distributive, interactional, and procedural justice, strain and family-to-work conflict were correlated with turnover intentions.  Results of the mediated regression analyses found that job satisfaction and affective commitment are significant mediators between distributive, interactional, and procedural justice, work strain, and family work conflict with turnover intentions.  The major implications from this research are that managers of organisation need to foster job satisfaction and affective commitment within their organisation to reduce turnover intentions.  In the final chapter, the conclusions are discussed in terms of its practical implications to organisations, employees and the need for future research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">turnover intentions</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">affective commitment</field><field name="subject">continuance commitment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2415</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wellbeing for children with a disability in New Zealand: A search for meaning by Maree Kirk</field><field name="creator">Kirk, Maree Louise</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the meaning of wellbeing for children with a disability in New Zealand, an area of social policy that has been largely unexamined. Focusing on the school environment, three questions are addressed: What does wellbeing mean for children with a disability? What factors influence it? Are current policy frameworks which address child wellbeing relevant to the wellbeing of children with a disability? The research involved qualitative data collection from nine purposively selected participants: children with a disability, their parents and key informants involved in service provision and policy development. A critical review of international and national literature on definitions of wellbeing and disability, and on existing data sources, is followed by a socio-demographic profile of children with a disability in New Zealand. Qualitative findings are interpreted in relation to current New Zealand social policy initiatives and frameworks - New Zealand's Agenda for Children, the Whole Child Approach and the Key Settings Model - as well as the theoretical perspectives of social solidarity, wellbeing, the ecological theory of human development and discourses of disability. Findings indicate that the concept of wellbeing as applied to all New Zealand children is also relevant to children with a disability. The difference however, lies in the factors which ultimately influence whether the various dimensions of wellbeing will actually be experienced by children with a disability. For these children, communication as a dimension of wellbeing for example, is influenced by language skill acquisition, which in turn depends upon allocation of appropriate and adequate resourcing of the child's learning environment. The conclusion drawn is that policy frameworks, principles and social indicators addressing child wellbeing, are inconsistently applied with regard to children with a disability. New Zealand's Agenda for Children which promotes an ecological approach to child wellbeing would benefit from further adaptation to reflect the needs of this specific child population. The notion of wellbeing for children with a disability needs further development for the purpose of knowledge building, and to ensure clearer articulation between processes of policy development, service provision, and resource allocation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children with disability</field><field name="subject">wellbeing</field><field name="subject">social inclusion</field><field name="subject">child disability data</field><field name="subject">child wellbeing NZ</field><field name="subject">Down Syndrome</field><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="subject">child capability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Breathing Stabilization System</field><field name="creator">Ling, Heping</field><field name="description">Breathing Stabilization System is a new idea and method.

The recent development of the Equilibrium Model is governed not only by &#916;G cat and &#916;G inact but also by two new intrinsic parameters &#916;Heq and Teq, which describe the enthalpy and the temperature of the midpoint, respectively, of a active and reversibly inactive enzyme transition. Teq is central to the physiological adaptation of an enzyme to its environmental temperature and links the molecular, physiological and environmental aspects of life to temperature in a way that has not been previously possible. The Equilibrium Model is therefore a more complete and accurate description of the effects of temperature on enzymes, it has provided new tools for describing and investigating enzyme thermal adaptation and possibly new biotechnological tools.  The effects of the incorporating in the new Model of the parameters Teq and &#916;H eq yield major differences from the Classical Model, with simulated data calculated according to the Equilibrium Model fitting well to experimental data and showing an initial rate temperature optimum that is independent of assay duration. Simulated data simulated according to the Classical Model can not be fitted to experimental data. All enzymes so far studied (gt30) display behaviour predicted by the Equilibrium Model.  The research described here has set out to: experimentally test observations made by Eisenthal et al., on the basis of enzyme reactor data simulated according to the Equilibrium Model; to test the Equilibrium Model using an unusual (rapidly renaturable) enzyme, RNAase; and to test the proposed molecular basis of the Equilibrium Model by examining the effect of a change at the enzymes active site.  The experimental results gathered here on the effect of time and temperature on enzyme reactor output confirm the predictions made by Eisenthal et al. (2006) and indicate that the Equilibrium Model can be a useful aid in predicting reactor performance. The Equilibrium Model depends upon the acquisition of data on the variation of the Vmax of an enzyme with time and temperature, and the non-ideal behaviour of RNase A made it impossible to collect such data for this enzyme, as a result the Equilibrium Model could not be applied. The disulfide bond within the active site cleft of A.k 1 protease was cleaved as a probe of the mechanism of the Equilibrium Model, which is proposed to arise from molecular changes at the enzymes active site. Support for the proposed mechanism was gained through the comparison of experimentally determined temperature dependence of the native and reduced forms of the enzyme and application of this data to the Equilibrium Model.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">enzymes</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="subject">equilibrium model</field><field name="subject">enzyme reactor</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The potential for Charophyte re-establishment in large, shallow, eutrophic lakes with special reference to Lake Waikare, New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Hopkins, Aareka</field><field name="description">Lake Waikare is a large, shallow eutrophic lake devoid of submerged macrophytes. I investigated potential methods for re-establishing submerged macrophytes in the lake. Specifically, I subjected charophyte (Chara corallina) plantlets to two treatments of exposure in the lake (in areas exposed and sheltered from wind) to test for survival and growth under these conditions, and inside and outside fish exclosures to test for growth and survival in the presence of fish. While plantlets grew outside the exclosures in winter, their accumulated biomass over 21 days was less than protected plantlets. In winter, the accumulated biomass was lower outside than inside exclosures (by ~40%) at the sheltered site and was lower outside than inside exclosures (by 43%) at the exposed site. Overall, growth rates in winter were higher at the sheltered site (compared to the exposed site) by ~7%. In summer, charophyte accumulated biomass inside the exclosures increased by 85%, while at the sheltered site accumulated biomass increased by 58%. Outside the exclosures in summer the plantlets were completely removed at both sites. Overall, growth rates where higher at the exposed site than the sheltered site by 31%. Fish were responsible for the partial removal of plantlets in winter and total removal of plantlets in summer, and therefore affect the survival and growth of charophytes in Lake Waikare. The embayment at the sheltered site provides the best location in winter for re-establishment of charophytes from oospores because better growth rates were obtained there, and its sheltered location provides protection from severe wave action found at the exposed site. Oospores did not germinate after being submersed in the lake for 90 days due to heavy sedimentation.  To induce an improvement in the present light climate, Alum was tested to determine its effectiveness and longevity for settling lake sediments to allow charophytes to establish and grow. Examining the settling rates of Lake Waikare sediments and water treated with Alum over a range of suspended sediment concentrations and time intervals, sediments settled faster with Alum than without for at least 15 days (at 200 g l^1 suspended sediment concentration) and it remained active to 60 days but at reduced effectiveness. At the other concentrations tested (100 g l^1 and 300 g l^1 suspended sediment concentration), Alum responses were insignificant.  An improved light climate achieved by fish removal or Alum treatment will likely not be sufficient to permit the re-establishment of submerged macrophytes due to the turbid, algal-dominated state of the lake. The present nutrient and sediment levels, wave climate and fish influence must be mitigated so charophyte plantlets can be established.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lake restoration</field><field name="subject">submerged macrophytes</field><field name="subject">shallow eutrophic lakes</field><field name="subject">Lake Waikare</field><field name="subject">Jar test</field><field name="subject">Alum</field><field name="subject">biomanipulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2419</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution and comparative haemoglobin oxygen binding in new zealand mudfishes</field><field name="creator">Brijs, Jeroen</field><field name="description">New Zealand's five endemic mudfish (Neochanna spp.) species have distributions that differ both geographically and by habitat type. Differences in habitat preferences between species have led to the proposal of an evolutionary series within the group. A morphological cline can be observed from the galaxiform Chatham Island and Canterbury species inhabiting lakes and streams, respectively, to the anguilliform Northland and brown mudfishes of ephemeral wetlands. Morphological specializations proposed for wetland dwelling include loss of pelvic fins, reduced eyes, enlarged nostrils, development of caudal flanges, and elongation of dorsal and anal fin bases to become almost confluent with the caudal fin.  Another expectation of adaptation to wetland dwelling is specializations in respiratory physiology to obtain oxygen from highly hypoxic or acidic waters, and the ability to cope with seasonal exposure to air during the drought season.  Expected respiratory specializations to wetland dwelling include high oxygen affinity haemoglobins, high levels of cooperative oxygen binding, the presence of multiple haemoglobins and the ability to aestivate and survive long periods of emersion. The four mainland Neochanna species were examined to determine if differences in haemoglobin expression as well as differences in haemoglobin oxygen binding correlated with differing habitats and treatments.  Whole blood oxygen affinity was determined at several pH levels (6.5, 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0) and temperatures (10'C, 15'C and 20'C), as well as different treatments (aestivating, fasting and control) using a Hemox analyzer.  The presence of multiple haemoglobins was determined by isoelectric focusing.  All four species displayed high oxygen affinities (p50 = 6.5 to 9.5 mm Hg at pH 7.5  15'C), moderate levels of cooperativity (Hill coefficients = 1.75 to 2.00 at pH 7.5  15'C), pH sensitivity (Bohr coefficients = -0.62 to -0.94 between pH 7.5 and 7.0 at 15'C), temperature sensitivity (&#916;H = -2.20 to -15.78 k cal mol-1 between 10'C and 15'C) and the presence of multiple haemoglobins.  Black, brown and Northland mudfish were able to survive aestivation for six weeks but there were no changes between air-breathing and water-breathing individuals with respect to oxygen binding characteristics.  Although there is evidence of habitat specialization in haemoglobin physiology between mudfish species, differences between species did not correlate with the evolutionary series proposed for specialization to dwelling in ephemeral wetlands and latitudinal distributions of mudfish species appear to strongly dictate oxygen binding properties of mudfish whole blood.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mudfish</field><field name="subject">haemoglobin oxygen binding</field><field name="subject">oxygen affinity</field><field name="subject">multiple haemoglobins</field><field name="subject">evolutionary cline</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Characteristics and Impacts of Landfill Leachate from Horotiu, New Zealand and Maseru, Lesotho: A Comparative Study</field><field name="creator">Mohobane, Thabiso</field><field name="description">Landfills are a potential pollution threat to both ground and surface water resources. This study focuses on two landfills, the Horotiu municipal waste landfill, near Hamilton, New Zealand, and the Maseru landfill in Lesotho. The Horotiu landfill is located less than 50 metres from the Waikato River and also sits on a shallow (lt;lm to water table) aquifer.  In Lesotho, the Maseru landfill is 4 km from a river and 2 km from a water reservoir and rests on a huge aquifer. Over 5000 people depend on groundwater in the area between the landfill and the river.  The objectives of my study were to: 1. compare and contrast conditions, management, and potential environmental impacts of the Horotiu and Maseru landfills; 2. evaluate the potential for groundwater contamination as the result of leachate migration; and 3. investigate the chemical characteristics of the landfill leachates and the impacts of the landfills on groundwater quality. The Horotiu study was based on the leachate and groundwater quality monitoring data obtained from the Hamilton City Council. Samples were collected every three months from 1991-2006 and analysed for about 30 chemical parameters. The data for the Maseru landfill consisted of groundwater quality collected by the author during July-September 2007 and borehole pumping data obtained from the Department of Water Affairs, in Lesotho. At Horotiu results indicate that the leachate had high concentrations of: NH4-N (630 mg/l), TOC (405 mg/l), BOD (126 mg/l), and COD (1289 mg/l), while heavy metals were in low concentrations (lt;0.1mg/l).   Leachate quality was found to change with time and with rainfall. Groundwater samples obtained from the landfill boreholes indicated that the Horotiu landfill had an influence in the quality of groundwater. Groundwater at the down-slope side of the landfill had higher concentrations of all chemical parameters, except for NO3-N, SO4-2 and Reactive P, than the groundwater on the upstream side. The mean groundwater quality at Horotiu was within New Zealand drinking water standards though some standards were exceeded by some individual samples.  In the Maseru landfill, the borehole water had high concentrations of chemical parameters such as EC (1580 &#956;S/cm) and Chloride (190 mg/l), compared to the national average of 250 &#956;S/cm and 28 mg/l. The Maseru landfill groundwater quality was within the WHO drinking water standard for all analysed chemical constituents, except lead. Groundwater beneath both landfills was influenced by leachate but the impacts are currently not at an alarming stage, for analysed chemical parameters. At Maseru introduction of landfill linings has potential to reduce the effect of leachate on groundwater.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">leachate</field><field name="subject">groundwater quality</field><field name="subject">landfills</field><field name="subject">Horotiu</field><field name="subject">Maseru</field><field name="subject">municipal waste</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measuring Auditory Thresholds in Brushtail Possums (Trichosurus Vulpecula)</field><field name="creator">Osugi, Mizuho</field><field name="description">A total of 9 brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) were trained to perform a two-manipulanda, conditional discrimination task.  The possums learned to press a right lever in the presence of a tone (80 dB(A)) during tone-on trials, and a left lever in the absence of the tone on tone-off trials.  Overall sessions of 11 conditions contained tone frequency between 100 Hz and 35 kHz were tested.  Each condition contained training and then probe sessions.   In training sessions, the possums were presented with tone-on and tone-off trials, pseudo-randomly.  Once the possums responded with over 90% accuracy for five consecutive sessions, then probe sessions were introduced.  Probe sessions were similar to the training sessions, except that the tone intensity for tone-on trials was reduced by 8 dB(A) across blocks of 20 trials until their response accuracy in a block fall below 60% or reached 24 dB(A).  Data were analysed using overall percentages correct and log d analysis.  Both measures indicated that overall response accuracy decreased for all possum as tone intensity reduced.  Based on these data analyses, threshold values were calculated using the criterions at 75% correct and a log d of 0.48.  The threshold values for each possum and across all possums were plotted as a function of the tone frequency to produce an audiogram.  A curvilinear regression was fitted for each threshold values.  The functions of both measures were very similar.  Both audiograms showed that the possums could hear the tones between 100 Hz and 35 kHz, and were most sensitive to tones between 15 and 20 kHz.  This experiment involved many difficulties with producing and measuring tones especially outside of human hearing range.  Due to these difficulties, several problems and concerns were raised during the experiment, these were discussed in this study and also recommendations for future research were then presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Audiogram</field><field name="subject">possums</field><field name="subject">trichosurus vulpecula</field><field name="subject">brushtail possums</field><field name="subject">auditory ability</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="subject">behavior</field><field name="subject">conditional discrimination</field><field name="subject">two alternatives</field><field name="subject">psychophysics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Platform for ergonomic steering methods nvestigation of quot Segway-style quot balancing scooters</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Weiqian</field><field name="description">Segway has been a popular production as an alternative transporter since its invention at the end of 20th century.

It reports on how the mentoring relationship between the two teachers and the researcher evolved over the period of the data collection process. The research also explores the two teachers perceptions of the existing professional development activities. Further, report on the existing barriers which restricted establishing continuous professional developmental opportunities in the primary schools of Maldives. Data collection was through action research using concept maps for formative assessment purposes. The concept map was planned as an intervention at mentoring sessions to incorporate new pedagogy to create student-centred learning opportunities. The intervention was evaluated intensively through observation and feedback in the mentoring process. The researcher had dual roles in this action research. One role was that of researcher: collecting data on the progression of the mentoring relationship and the pedagogical changes by the participants. The second was that of mentor: coaching and assisting the two teachers to reflect on the planning and executing of the intervention in their respective classrooms. Through the action research process, data was collected on changes that the two teachers brought to their teaching. Data was also gathered on the mentoring relationship that evolved in the data collection process. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate the two teachers&#8223; willingness to engage in their own learning. The semi-structured interviews also explored the two teachers&#8223; perception on mentoring to establish a culture of learning in the school. The study indicated that one-off professional development sessions and a system of in-school clinical supervision to be the main professional development activities for the schools. Further the findings indicated that these activities did not meet the teachers&#8223; learning needs. ii Findings also indicated that the participants favoured the learning opportunities mentoring process created. The study further established both participants as keen learners, and willing participants in planning and re-planning the intervention in the mentoring process for the action research. The findings also report that the collaborative work atmosphere in the mentoring relationship assisted the two teachers to eliminate the fears associated with introducing new pedagogy. In conclusion, the study reports on barriers that may restrict creating effective mentoring relationships in primary schools of Maldives. The barriers identified were associated time for mentoring, mismatch of mentoring partners, poor collaborative relationships and mentor knowledge and experience. In addition recommends exploring how the supervisors&#8223; current role of evaluator can be changed to mentor role and the possibilities of group mentoring. Further study is recommended to explore how long term mentoring relationships can be developed considering the time constraints in Maldivian two session primary schools.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mentoring</field><field name="subject">collaborative professional development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Testing the effectiveness of the mt DNA Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene locus for identifying species of Polychaete worm (Polychaeta: Annelida) in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Brett, Christy Donna</field><field name="description">The ability to accurately identify species is fundamental to ecological research and environmental monitoring. Current taxonomic identifications often rely on differentiation of morphologically ambiguous characters, and a process of categorization which is tedious and often leads to misidentifications. This is compounded by the presence of cryptic taxa, which may be prevalent among Polychaete worms (Polychaeta: Annelida). With increased access to genetic techniques, Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I has been suggested as a possible aid to assist in the discrimination of species resources. In this study, I tested the hypothesis that the mtDNA COI gene locus is effective in discriminating morphologically recognised species of Polychaete worms. A 543 base-pair fragment of the COI locus was successfully extracted for 111 individuals from 16 out of 20 morphologically recognised species. Average intraspecific divergences were 0.8 %, ranging from 0 % to 5 %. Average interspecific variation was 26.4 %, ranging from 13.8 % to 36.8 %. The lowest divergences were found between two Nereid species (13.8 %), and two Glycera americana species (17.2 %). Relatively high maximum divergences of over 30 % suggest that some species may have reached a divergence saturation level, which may partially explain why familial groupings in constructed trees were not monophyletic. Divergences within the different Nereid species - a group previously known to have morphologically cryptic species - did not reveal the presence of any cryptic taxa. Pairwise comparisons showed a clear divide between percentages of intra- and interspecific divergences, and the suggested threshold of 11 % is effective for the taxa investigated here. On the basis of these results, I conclude that sequence variation in the mtDNA COI gene locus is effective in discriminating morphologically recognised species of Polychaete worms, but may not be appropriate for deeper (e.g. generic or familial) phylogenetic relationships among taxa.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mt DNA</field><field name="subject">Cytochrome c oxidase</field><field name="subject">COI</field><field name="subject">polychaete</field><field name="subject">polychaeta</field><field name="subject">annelida</field><field name="subject">morphology</field><field name="subject">divergence</field><field name="subject">cryptic</field><field name="subject">worm</field><field name="subject">gene</field><field name="subject">locus</field><field name="subject">intraspecific</field><field name="subject">interspecific</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Counselling Patients with a Spinal Cord Injury</field><field name="creator">Sliedrecht, Susan</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to improve current counselling services at the Auckland Spinal Unit. This purpose was achieved by co-researching the topic with people who have extensive experience of living in the community with a spinal cord injury to reveal what they believe was helpful, or believe would have been helpful, in terms of the counselling, when they were newly injured. Listening to the stories of the research participants, through supervision of my own practice, doing a literature review and writing a journal became sources that provided rich knowledges to reflect on my current counselling practice. A qualitative study was conducted using aspects of action research, feminist research and post-structuralist methods. In November 2005, an information pack was mailed to the sixteen patients who had been discharged from the Auckland Spinal Unit between June 2002 and June 2004, who were under the age of sixty -five and lived in the Auckland area, inviting them to participate in this research. Seven people agreed and were available to participate. I interviewed these seven participants, using unstructured interviews. All the interviews were audio-taped and then transcribed verbatim. These verbatim transcripts were then sent back to the participants for any additions/deletions/alterations they chose to make. To initiate the reflecting process, I then went through all the interviews and identified common themes. I understand that if the research participants had been involved in this process, other themes might have emerged for them. The themes identified were loss and grief as a result of a spinal cord injury, sexuality, family (whanau) involvement and how counselling services should be positioned in a setting such as the Auckland Spinal Unit. These themes formed the iii foci of the chapters, with an additional chapter on weaving cultural threads into counselling. The main findings of the study centre on the very important role of counselling at the Auckland Spinal Unit. In particular, the study highlighted the importance of counselling as a place for conversations that make room for multiple positionings and multiple versions of events, a space that respects a patient's hopes, beliefs and dreams for his/her life (which often does not include wheelchairs, catheters and caregivers) but that also supports the patient to make meaning of living life with a spinal cord injury. The study also identified the importance of sexuality counselling. Not including sexuality as a topic in the rehabilitation services provided perpetuates dominant discourses that a person with a spinal cord injury does not want sexual intimacy or cannot be sexually intimate and cannot have children. Family (whanau) involvement in and family's becoming part of the rehabilitation team was very important to most participants. This study looks at how this involvement can be achieved and explores some of the structures currently in place at the Auckland Spinal Unit to facilitate this involvement. Participants in this study expressed a desire for counselling to be highly accessible to both themselves and their families (whanau). They would prefer the counsellors to get to know the patients in their own environment first (in their rooms), so that the patients are positioned to have agency to make choices about how they would like to use the available counselling services. The study concludes with my personal journey of working as a counsellor at the Auckland Spinal Unit and how this research has shaped and fine-tuned my practice.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spinal Injury</field><field name="subject">Disability</field><field name="subject">Counselling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cyclorheniated Azabutadienes and Their Reactions with Unsaturated Molecules</field><field name="creator">Asamizu, Toshie</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the studies on the reaction of 1-azabutadienes with PhCH2Re(CO)5 to prepare the cyclometallated azabutadiene tetracarbonyl compounds.  Three 1-azabutadienes with different reactivity on the N and C-1 carbons were prepared and their reactions with PhCH2Re(CO)5 were investigated.  All the reactions gave a mixture of the cyclorheniated azabutadienes and the isomers of the substituted derivatives formed by substitution by a second azabutadiene.  The substituted derivatives as the mixture were always the main products of the reactions and were obtained in good-to-excellent yield even under modified conditions intended to optimise the yield of the cyclorheniated azabutadienes. The yield could not be improved beyond 30 %. Isomerisation of the azabutadiene about the N=C bond provided very rare cis-azabutadiene metal complexes. NMR studies on the mixture of the two isomers and suggested that the product ratio depended on the molar ratio of PhCH2Re(CO)5 in the reaction mixtures.  The reactions gave the Re analogues of the products obtained in the corresponding Mn reactions.  All the compounds were characterised spectroscopically as well as by microanalysis and examples of all three types were structurally determined by X-ray crystallography.

This study investigated the relationships of attitudinal factors with absenteeism and turnover intentions at a large healthcare organisation in the Bay of Plenty. A questionnaire completed by 407 employees had several measures such as job involvement, job satisfaction, organisational commitment (affective and continuance commitment), perceived organisational support, perceived supervisor support, work-to-family conflict, family-to-work conflict, team cohesion, regional identification and turnover intention. Absenteeism data were collected from personnel records. The results indicated a probable association of job satisfaction, work-to-family conflict and perceived supervisor support with absenteeism, while turnover intention was associated with all predictors except continuance commitment. Perceived organisational support partially mediated the relationship between perceived supervisor support and turnover intention. No moderator effects were found for job involvement, perceived supervisor support and team cohesion on relationships between work-to-family conflict and affective commitment/job satisfaction and perceived organisational support and affective commitment respectively, however strong main effects were shown for job involvement and team cohesion. The main finding is that organisations must understand how organisational and supervisor support increases job satisfaction and affective commitment and decreases work-to-family conflict, which lowers absenteeism and turnover intention. The detection of high levels of regional identification indicate the need to acknowledge this construct, particularly in relation to turnover intention.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">absenteeism</field><field name="subject">turnover intention</field><field name="subject">job attitudes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effective School Leadership: An exploration of the issues inhibiting the effectiveness of school leadership in Solomon Islands' secondary schools</field><field name="creator">Malasa, Donald Papaku</field><field name="description">This study investigates issues impeding effective school leadership in Solomon Islands' secondary schools. In particular, it examines principals' perceptions of those issues that impede their effective leadership of their schools. There is an international literature focusing on this area that has contributed to the study. However, many of the research findings in western contexts are invalid in the context of a developing nation such as the Solomon Islands.  Thus contextual specificity was an important underlying factor in the study. The research data was gathered using qualitative methods. Specifically, interviews with five principals were conducted using semi-structured interviews and was analysed using a thematic analysis approach. The research fieldwork was carried out in the Solomon Islands in August 2006. A sample of five participants was used. They were selected from five schools representing Community High Schools (CHS) and senior Provincial Secondary Schools (PSS) in two provinces and the Honiara City Council.  The key findings of the study identify a range of factors that inhibit effective school leadership.  These included a lack of initial training and support for on-going professional learning, unfavourable conditions of service, poor quality of teachers' professional practice, poor school facilities and infrastructure, poor administrative infrastructure, lack of appropriate and adequate financial resources, lack of support personnel, policy and systemic issues, social and cultural issues, and issues pertaining to school-community partnerships.  Based on the findings identified in the study, recommendations were made on how to improve effective leadership of the schools throughout the Solomon Islands. Of particular importance is the establishment of professional development programmes for both newly appointed and servicing principals. Such programmes should enhance the leadership capacity of the principals in the schools and create a more conducive learning environment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">school leadership</field><field name="subject">Solomon Islands</field><field name="subject">Pacific Region</field><field name="subject">Melanesian Region</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Party Season: A Screenplay-Based Inquiry into Filming and Judgment, with Accompanying Essay'.</field><field name="creator">Shepherd, Barrett James</field><field name="description">Party Season is about sex and speech and employs some of the conventions of the porn film. Apparently inconsequential 'filler' scenes and dialogue link the pay-off scenes of vividly depicted sex. Except that, in Party Season, this relationship is gradually reversed - the scenes of excessive behaviour becoming 'filler' scenes linking the pay-off moments, the latter often embedded in deliberately extended 'unrealistic' dialogue. A key component of this as a piece of inquiry-based practice is the exploration of this altering balance and of how action and dialogue can function to produce such a reversal of conventionality. The intention with the accompanying essay is to sustain a progressive interweaving of reflective commentary and analytical vignettes. There is also an intended symmetry here - an 'excessive' essay (long, without conventional subheadings, breaks, etc.) will sit alongside the 'excessive' screenplay as its twin of sorts, a different style of invention.

Research has shown that modern mass media provide a mediated cultural forum through which policy responses to child poverty are socially negotiated and from which public support for children in need is either cultivated or undermined. This thesis focuses on the role of media advocacy by the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) who attempt to widen public debate and legitimate options for addressing child poverty. I investigate the case of the Government's Working for Families package and the controversy surrounding the media release of CPAG's negative evaluation of the package in the form of a research report Cut Price Kids. Attention is given to competing ideological frames underlying the Government's package, in the form of neo-liberal emphases on distinctions between  God's  and the  Devil's  poor. Attention is also given to CPAG's response, in the form of communitarian notions of collective responsibility for all families in need. Specifically, I analyse the role of the mass media in framing child poverty as a social issue across three levels of mass communication - production, representation, and reception. At the production level interviews were held with six journalists involved with reporting on Cut Price Kids and two members of CPAG. Fifteen Government and 5 CPAG press releases were also explored to document media production processes and restraints on public deliberations. In addition, the ideological stances influencing the framing of coverage were investigated. At the media representation level 21 press, seven radio, and five television items were analysed to establish the scope of public debate, whose perspectives were included, and the ways in which differing perspectives are combined. At the reception level four focus group discussions with lower socio-economic status (SES) parent groups, as well as follow-up photo-based interviews with eight participants were explored in order to document the role of media coverage in the lives of families with children living in poverty. Across levels, findings suggest that journalists are restrained by professional practices which maintain the importance of balance and detached objectivity, rather than interpretations of appropriate responses to child poverty. Tensions between the Government's emphasis on restricting support to families with parents in paid employment and CPAG's emphasis on the need to not discriminate against the children of out of work families framed coverage. The lower SES parents participating at the reception level challenged the restrained nature of coverage, which excluded people such as themselves, and openly questioned media characterisations of them as  bludgers  who are irresponsible parents. Overall, findings support the view that media are a key component of ongoing social dialogues through which public understandings of, and policy responses to, child poverty are constructed. Specifically, psychologists need to engage more with processes of symbolic power which shape the public construction of child poverty in a conservative manner that can lead to victim blaming, and restrains opportunities for addressing this pressing social concern.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child poverty</field><field name="subject">Child Poverty Action Group</field><field name="subject">Working for Families</field><field name="subject">media advocacy</field><field name="subject">civic journalism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Saudi secondary school science teachers' perceptions of the use of ICT tools to support teaching and learning</field><field name="creator">Almaghlouth, Osamah Abdulwahab D.</field><field name="description">This research was conducted to investigate the Saudi science teachers' perception of the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools to enhance teaching and learning and undertake a small and groundwork examination of these teachers current use of ICT. It draws on the interpretive paradigm (Cohen  Manion, 1994), where the focus is on how people interpret and make sense of their world. From this interpretive perspective the beliefs of Saudi secondary school science teachers, in relation to the benefits of ICT, their current use of ICT and their perceived needs for improvement in the use of ICT in the classroom were investigated. Saudi secondary schools science teachers from both girls' and boys' schools in three different types of schools have been involved in this study. There were 28 government schools (9 girls' and 19 boys' schools), four small schools in rented premises (2 girls' and 2 boys' schools) and four Aramco schools (1 girls' and 3 boys' schools). These schools were in different districts: Aldammam city, Alkhobar city, Aldahran city, Alqateaf city and Sufwa city. The teachers were asked to voluntarily participate in the study and 131 teachers out of 200 (86 male and 45 female, 65 %) completed the questionnaire. Analysis of the data, together with the relevant literature builds a picture of the use of ICT in science education. Providing ICT hardware and software resources to a school is not enough to ensure significant developments in use of ICT for teaching and learning in Saudi science classrooms. Access to working ICT continues to be an issue for these teachers. Although teachers identified many benefits to teachers and students from using ICT and had made individual efforts to develop their use of ICT for admin planning and lesson preparation, they also identified barriers. These barriers focused on a lack of appropriate professional development and technical support. The findings have implications for future development in the area of ICT. It is expected that the results of the research will guide future research and development in the country and outline the importance of the use of information and communication technology in education for teachers, students, parents and decision-makers. It will contribute information towards decision-making and planning in future projects.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ICT</field><field name="subject">ICT tools</field><field name="subject">science education</field><field name="subject">Saudi secondary schools</field><field name="subject">science teachers</field><field name="subject">Information and Communication Technology</field><field name="subject">teaching  and learning</field><field name="subject">science female teachers</field><field name="subject">digital microscope</field><field name="subject">sensors</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women's Views about the Characteristics of the 'Ideal Woman Worker': A Preliminary Study.</field><field name="creator">Heath, Adrienne</field><field name="description">The initial reason I undertook this preliminary study was to inform myself and others about the views of women about the expectations of them as 'ideal workers' in paid employment. What resulted was a piece of research focused on women who recently graduated from the School of Education at the University of Waikato. This preliminary study challenged me in many ways. It challenged my existing knowledge, it challenged my beliefs and most of all it challenged me to think about the world of women through very many different sets of eyes. When I began this preliminary study there was very little previous research, which encouraged me greatly. I felt there was a large window of opportunity to present some initial findings about women and their role as 'ideal workers' in paid employment. The literature review investigated scholarly research and the TEC documents, resulting in the establishment of three macro-level elements that assist in creating the 'ideal worker'. Using feminist theory and three feminist critiques I constructed a reformulation of the 'ideal woman worker'. This preliminary study used a qualitative approach. A semi-structured interview technique was used to gather information from 5 participants. The women, aged 25 or over, had recently completed their Graduate Diploma in Teaching (Secondary). The selected findings revealed the experiences and views of the women participants which were presented as four main themes. These were the skill to manage demands between family and work, the capacity to care, the expertise to communicate, and the ability to be flexible. Three themes within the discussion were the gap between the TEC documents and women's views, the dominance of 'woman-ness', and the evidence of political ignorance. One of two main points of interest raised within the discussion was the tension between the New Right ideologies of previous governments, and the 'Third Way' ideologies of our current government. The evidence suggests that the tension between these ideologies is creating a gap between policy documents, in this case the TEC, and the understandings of the female respondents. The other main point of interest was the way women continue to adopt and appear to accept the traditional gender stereotypes. The women respondents iv involved in this preliminary study valued the capacity of women to care and nurture in both the private and public sphere. They also appeared to accept that these 'gender specific' attributes were not necessarily valued within the public sphere. In other words, these women accepted the inequalities that are still part of the world of 'paid' work. Recommendations were formulated for future theory, research and practice for those who are interested in pursuing aspects of this preliminary study. The recommendations may assist in moulding, refining and shaping the future of tertiary education, the role that women perform within the public and private sphere, and possibly the 'ideal woman worker' in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tertairy education</field><field name="subject">women workers</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Web-based Geographical Information System for Low Bandwidth Access</field><field name="creator">Shi, Zhennan</field><field name="description">The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have become popular tool, used in different fields.

The subsurface water is brackish and saline so the entire country depends totally on rainwater for daily domestic supplies, agricultural and farming activities. More importantly, these atolls are often influenced by droughts which consequently make inadequate drinking water an issue. A simple graph-based forecasting scheme is developed and presented in this thesis for forecasting below average mean rainfall in Funafuti over the next n-month period. The approach uses precursor ocean surface temperature data to make predictions of below average rainfall for n = 1, 2   12. The simplicity of the approach makes it a suitable method for the country and thus for the Tuvalu Meteorological Service to use as an operational forecasting tool in the climate forecasting desk. The graphical method was derived from standardised monthly rainfalls from the Funafuti manual raingauge for the period January 1945 to July 2007. The method uses lag-1 and-lag 2 NINO4 sea surface temperatures to define whether prediction conditions hold. The persistence of predictability tends to be maintained when the observed NINO4 ocean surface temperatures fall below 26.0oC. Although the developed method has a high success probability of up to 80 percent, this can only be achieved when conditions are within the predictable field. A considerable number of below average rainfall periods are not within the predictable field and therefore cannot be forecast by this method. However, the graphical approach has particular value in warning when an existing drought is likely to continue.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">long-range forecasting</field><field name="subject">low rainfalls</field><field name="subject">Funafuti</field><field name="subject">Tuvalu</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prediction Intervals for Class Probabilities</field><field name="creator">Yu, Xiaofeng</field><field name="description">Prediction intervals for class probabilities are of interest in machine learning because they can quantify the uncertainty about the class probability estimate for a test instance. The idea is that all likely class probability values of the test instance are included, with a pre-specified confidence level, in the calculated prediction interval. This thesis proposes a probabilistic model for calculating such prediction intervals. Given the unobservability of class probabilities, a Bayesian approach is employed to derive a complete distribution of the class probability of a test instance based on a set of class observations of training instances in the neighbourhood of the test instance. A random decision tree ensemble learning algorithm is also proposed, whose prediction output constitutes the neighbourhood that is used by the Bayesian model to produce a PI for the test instance. The Bayesian model, which is used in conjunction with the ensemble learning algorithm and the standard nearest-neighbour classifier, is evaluated on artificial datasets and modified real datasets.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bayesian classifier</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applying Kaupapa M&#257;ori Processes to Documentary Film.</field><field name="creator">Waititi, Kahurangi Rora</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the application of Kaupapa M&#257;ori processes to documentary filmmaking through practiced-led research.

This Thesis, therefore, investigates alternative processes of filming that have developed from a Kaupapa M&#257;ori perspective through practical filming experience.  An historical overview of the relationship between M&#257;ori, media and filming practices have been provided to give context to this discussion.  The application of Kaupapa M&#257;ori processes to film was considered through the use of Marae protocol and philosophies. The application of these concepts was supported by the creative research which was utilised by referencing specific examples. The reader is, therefore, instructed to refer to the DVD in the front of the thesis as referenced in the written text.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori documentary</field><field name="subject">Maori film</field><field name="subject">indigenous documentary</field><field name="subject">indigenous film</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design of lightweigh electric vehicles</field><field name="creator">de Fluiter, Travis</field><field name="description">The design and manufacture of lightweight electric vehicles is becoming increasingly important with the rising cost of petrol, and the effects emissions from petrol powered vehicles are having on our environment. The University of Waikato and HybridAuto's Ultracommuter electric vehicle was designed, manufactured, and tested. The vehicle has been driven over 1800km with only a small reliability issue, indicating that the Ultracommuter was well designed and could potentially be manufactured as a solution to ongoing transportation issues. The use of titanium aluminide components in the automotive industry was researched. While it only has half the density of alloy steel, titanium aluminides have the same strength and stiffness as steel, along with good corrosion resistance, making them suitable as a lightweight replacement for steel components. Automotive applications identified that could benefit from the use of TiAl include brake callipers, brake rotors and electric motor components.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EV</field><field name="subject">BEV</field><field name="subject">battery electric vehicle</field><field name="subject">vehicle</field><field name="subject">car</field><field name="subject">future</field><field name="subject">li-ion</field><field name="subject">battery</field><field name="subject">aerodynamics</field><field name="subject">body</field><field name="subject">suspension</field><field name="subject">lightweight vehicle design</field><field name="subject">lightweight</field><field name="subject">virtual engineering</field><field name="subject">CAE</field><field name="subject">CAD</field><field name="subject">CAM</field><field name="subject">titanium aluminide</field><field name="subject">titanium</field><field name="subject">TiAl</field><field name="subject">gamma</field><field name="subject">Ultracommuter</field><field name="subject">wheel motor</field><field name="subject">motor controller</field><field name="subject">aluminium chassis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Are Attributes of Corporate Governance Related to the Incidence of Fraudulent Financial Reporting</field><field name="creator">Bourke, Nicola Margaret</field><field name="description">This study investigates whether a relationship exists between fraudulent financial reporting and a variety of corporate governance attributes.  Numerous high profile accounting scandals perpetuated over recent years have brought prominence to the corporate governance structure employed by US public companies.  Many of these scandals involved manipulation of the financial reporting process by high level managers.  It is therefore thought that a lack of effective oversight provided by the governing bodies engaged to monitor the actions of management may be at the heart of the problem.  A review of prior research is used to identify the attributes of corporate governance relevant for inclusion in this study and to provide support for the posing of twenty directional hypotheses.  The selected corporate governance attributes are classified into four broad categories depicting Audit Committee Functionality, Board of Director Composition, Ownership Structure, and External Auditor Factors.  A matched pair research design is utilised to determine whether significant differences exist between the corporate governance attributes employed by fraud and non-fraud companies.  A sample of 76 fraud companies, identified through an examination of Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases issued by the Securities Exchange Commission and drawn from a total of 223 companies examined, are tested along with an industry-size matched sample of non-fraud companies.  The results of univariate paired t-tests and a conditional logistic regression equation find that statistically significant relationships do exist between a number of corporate governance attributes and fraudulent financial reporting.  Specifically, the study finds that the percentage of independent directors on a company's board, the existence of a nominating committee, and the engaging of a Big6 auditor are negatively related to the incidence of fraud.  Whereas, the average number of directorships held by audit committee members, the duality of the CEO and Chairman of the Board positions, and the percentage of company ownership held by outside blockholders are positively related to the incidence of fraudulent financial reporting.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fraud</field><field name="subject">Fraudulent Financial Reporting</field><field name="subject">Financial Reporting</field><field name="subject">Corporate Governance</field><field name="subject">Audit Committee</field><field name="subject">Board of Directors</field><field name="subject">Auditor</field><field name="subject">Ownership Structure</field><field name="subject">Financial Statement</field><field name="subject">Accounting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electric Fence to PC Wireless Radio Frequency Communications Interface</field><field name="creator">Gomez Poo, David Fernando</field><field name="description">Electric fencing is commonly used on New Zealand's farms.

The next stage of the development is to use wireless devices to accomplish those same tasks from remote locations. This project aims to develop a prototype that provides a wireless link between an electric fence and a personal computer in a remote location.

Erebus, Antarctica</field><field name="creator">Soo, Rochelle</field><field name="description">Only a few studies have looked at microbial biogeography in soils and whether microorganisms are endemic to an area is still debatable. Tramway Ridge, a geothermal area on Mount Erebus, Antarctica, provides a unique opportunity due to its isolation and extreme conditions to explore the possibilities of microbial endemism and to identify novel Bacteria and Archaea. This site was chosen for a culture-independent study with a preliminary culturing survey for bacterial communities along three temperature gradients (65 C - 2.5'C). In addition, a physico-chemical analysis was undertaken to identify which environmental factors were driving the different diversity along the transects. An automated rRNA intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) was used to assess the diversity across the transects using Bacteria and Cyanobacteria-specific primers and results showed that temperature and pH were the main drivers for these communities. Due to its unique physico-chemical and ARISA profile, a hot temperature site (T-3A, 65'C) was chosen for further investigation by bacterial and archaeal 16S rDNA clone libraries. Unique rDNA types among the 78 bacterial and 83 archaeal clones were identified by restriction fragment length polymophisms and 18 bacterial and 5 archaeal operational taxonomic units (gt97% identity) were observed. All of the bacterial sequences were deeply branching and loosely affiliated with other recognised bacterial divisions, with 40% of the sequences not affiliated to any genus. The archaeal clones were found to be deep-branching and sequences clustered together within the Crenarcaheota. In addition, two strains of Bacilli were isolated. The novel microorganisms show that the Tramway Ridge communities are unique from organisms found in other environments and show that quotEverything is (not) everywherequot.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tramway Ridge</field><field name="subject">Mt Erebus</field><field name="subject">Bacteria</field><field name="subject">Archaea</field><field name="subject">Physico-chemical</field><field name="subject">culture-independent</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acceptance and commitment therapy for public speaking anxiety: A self-help format</field><field name="creator">Beharry, Prya</field><field name="description">A non-concurrent multiple baseline design across eight participants was used to determine whether working through Hayes and Smith's (2005) book would help those with public speaking anxiety. Hayes and Smith (2005) is based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. It encourages people to accept internal experiences as opposed to avoiding and struggling with them. For the purposes of this study, the book was divided into nine components, which participants discussed with the researcher. They also completed measures daily, during baseline and over the intervention period, as well as a battery of tests pre-baseline, mid and post intervention. The multiple baseline data showed that self-reported willingness to approach public speaking situations increased while self-reported avoidance decreased over the intervention. The pre and post measures also showed avoidance of internal experiences decreased significantly after the intervention. These outcomes are in line with changes suggested to result from engaging in such a therapy. The pre and post results also showed that quality of life increased significantly from mid to post-intervention. However, engagement with values did not change. While this measure is expected to change after such an intervention, this result may have occurred because the ideas about values were introduced last in the book. The intervention also led to significant decreases in anxiety, significant changes in thoughts about public speaking and significant increases in anxiety control as shown by the test battery. These findings are positive but are not predicted by processes posited for this therapy. However, there was no control group so these pre vs post comparisons must be interpreted with caution. Despite this limitation, the results suggest that the book, together with therapist contact, can help those with public speaking anxiety.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acceptance and commitment therapy</field><field name="subject">self-help interventions</field><field name="subject">public speaking anxiety</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wilderness : an inventory, methodology and preliminary survey of South Australia</field><field name="creator">Lesslie, R.

This thesis identifies the purposes and processes of self-review used in six primary schools in New Zealand. The study also identifies the roles that leaders play in the self-review process and also highlights the impact of teacher research on the process.  The research questions are: 1.	What are the processes and purposes of self-review in schools and what roles do leaders play in the process? 2.	What aspects of teachers' practice have an impact on the self-review process?  This research study adopted a qualitative research methodology with semi-structured interviews as the research tool. The qualitative information gathered from the six schools was analysed and written up as a case study. For the purpose of this thesis, self-review is identified as the process of review of all school practices with the intention of improving student achievement.  The findings indicated that the main purposes of conducting school self-review were to enhance student achievement, to review school policies and programmes and also to ensure accountability. This study also indicated that through a well-planned process of self-review schools can achieve their goals and fulfill the aims stated in their school charter. Another aspect which participants revealed was that self-reviews result in change and therefore leaders and school staff should have the necessary skills and competencies to deal with and manage such change. This was also identified as an issue of self-review. Participants believed that effective leadership is essential to conduct self-reviews which result in positive outcomes.  This study found that the failure to achieve school improvement through self-review, is in part due to the structure of many current self-review programmes. At present, schools perceive self-review as the need to review everything that takes place. This perception may mean that valuable time and money is spent on something that the school does not deem significant. Rather, the findings of this study suggest that concentrating on particular areas for a certain period of time results in a better performance of the whole school.  In conclusion, this thesis found that school development and improvement cannot happen without enhancing and focusing on student achievement. For self-review to be successful, it should be carried out in a collaborative school climate of open and honest communication, mutual support and mutual responsibility. For it to be successful, self-review should also be planned, systematic, and ongoing. Data collection for self-review should be done through illuminative, participatory and responsive inquiry methods.  Finally, I recommend that further research is needed in the area of self-review and perhaps an exploration of the possible links between a school's decile level and its self-review process.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">self-review</field><field name="subject">school improvement</field><field name="subject">school development</field><field name="subject">student achievement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Rapid, Small-Scale Method for Improving Fermentation Medium Performance</field><field name="creator">Zhu, Yin</field><field name="description">Cell biomass and chemicals (e.g. bioactive compounds) can be produced by fermentation.  Optimising a fermentation system involves optimizing many variables such as determining the effect of inoculum quality and media components, and selecting the most appropriate fermenter design and operating conditions (such as agitation aeration and fermentation mode).  Identifying the optimal media is very important because it can significantly affect product concentration, yield and productivity.  However, the media contains many components so many trials need to be done, which makes the process laborious, expensive, open-ended, and often time-consuming.  The data generated from the many trials can be difficult to analyse.  This study developed a rapid, inexpensive small-scale technique to identify how media components affected the growth of Streptomyces hygroscopicus and its production of a secondary metabolite, the anti-tumour agent rapamycin.  A method was developed using microtitre plates to screen the effect of three concentrations of nine media components on cell growth and rapamycin production using the Box-Behnken experimental design.  Firstly, the methodology for microtitre plates was developed, which involved characterizing the physical parameters of a fermentation system, identifying the incubation time to minimize evaporation, modifying the assay method to deal with the small sample volumes, and developing an alternative method to determinate the rapamycin concentration that was cheaper than the HPLC method.  Data from shake flasks trials (the normal screening method) were used to validate the microtitre method and to assess the latter's usefulness in predicting scale-up effects.  Six media components - sodium chloride (NaCl), di-potassium orthophosphate (K2HPO4), l-aspartic acid, l-arginine, l-histidine and salt (formula 1) solution - significantly affected culture growth and/or rapamycin concentration.  The regression tree method was used to indicate the importance and critical concentration range of each factor.  The Pearson's product-moment value indicated a good correlation between data from microtitre plates and shake flasks (cell growth: r=0.75 p=0.016 n=8; rapamycin concentration r=0.92 p=0.08 n=6).  The speed of the microtitre plate and shake methods were compared by assessing the total cycle time and the time required for various stages in the method.  Performance of each method was assessed as cost of media and equipment.  Using microtitre plates to screen and optimise media in terms of biomass and secondary metabolite production is faster and cheaper than using shake flasks.  Labour efficiency for the numerous, repetitive, small-scale experiments was substantially increased.  Trials could be run without well-to-well cross contamination.  The  regression tree  statistics methodology successfully showed the effect of input variables on target variables and identified effective medium component concentrations and any interactions.  It is recommended that the microtitre plate procedure developed in this research may be applied to any study investigating the optimum media composition for growing other Streptomyces spp. strains, in screening studies when searching for new bioactive molecules, or for characterizing natural or recombinant/mutated micro-organisms.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">media design</field><field name="subject">optimisation</field><field name="subject">rapamycin</field><field name="subject">streptomyces hygroscopicus</field><field name="subject">experimental design</field><field name="subject">96-well microtitre</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Continental Shelf as a Site for Dredged Material Disposal, Northeast New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Flaim, Bryna K.</field><field name="description">Disposal of dredged material has been an on-going problem in the Auckland Coastal Marine Area (CMA) since the early 1980s in New Zealand.  Many disposal grounds have been established and used, but public concern over adverse effects resulted in their ultimate closure.  Presently, dredged material is disposed off-shore at a site simultaneously accessed by the Royal New Zealand Navy for disposal of WWII munitions recovered from coastal areas.  As early as the mid-1990s, parliamentary focus groups established the need for a more suitable disposal option for dredged material.  Establishment of a disposal site north of Cuvier Island in waters deeper than 100 m was one of the key recommendations presented by these groups.  The need for a new site was compounded after the establishment of the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park in 2000.  Taking up the majority of the Auckland CMA this culturally significant Park makes the consent for open water disposal a complex process.  A site east of Great Barrier Island in 140 m of water has been identified as a potential suitable site for disposal of dredged material.  The main goal of the present study is to determine the suitability of this site and provide the necessary information required by enforcing authorities for permit submission. Investigations to determine the suitability of the site were undertaken in several ways.  An extensive literature review of previous studies was carried out to gain insight into the physical and biological characteristics of the northeast coast and shelf.  The main hydrodynamic features of the region and the observed behaviours were determined.  Attentions were then directed at determining the more specific site characteristics.  Analytical calculations were undertaken using known site parameters to estimate the potential for transport of sediment away from the site after disposal.  Through analysis of known wave and current measurements it was estimated that only rarely would sediment be entrained off the seafloor.  Samples were then collected from the site in November 2007, which were used for sediment textural analysis and benthic identification.  It was determined that the main textural component of the site sediments is muddy/sand.  Diversity of benthic species is relatively high, but abundance is low.  Polychaetes were the most diverse and abundant taxon identified at sample locations across the site.  Next, the 3DD model was used to numerically simulate 2-dimensional tidal currents.  Depth-averaged spring tidal currents at the site were predicted to be less than 0.2 ms-1.  The derived bottom velocity for such a current is 0.08 ms-1, which is much less than the velocity required for initiation of sediment movement in this case.  The numerical simulation also showed that residual spring tidal flow is directed to the southeast.  Finally, an assessment of potential impacts was done by reviewing previous studies of ecological impacts caused by disposal of dredged material.  Based on the preliminary studies summarised above, the review of potential impacts indicates that there will only be minimal effects at and surrounding the proposed site.  The result of this study is an encouraging step toward establishment of a new disposal option, but further research is required to confidently declare that the site is suitable for disposal operations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dredged material</field><field name="subject">disposal</field><field name="subject">continental shelf</field><field name="subject">northeast New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dreamers of the Dark: Kerry Bolton and the Order of the Left Hand Path, a Case-study of a Satanic/Neo-Nazi Synthesis</field><field name="creator">van Leeuwen, Wilhelmus Roelof</field><field name="description">In 1990 a small self-published journal/magazine called The Watcher was distributed among New Zealand's occult underground.  The Watcher described itself as 'the New Zealand Voice of the Left Hand Path', and was published as the journal of the Order of the Left Hand Path.  The Watcher and the Order directed its attentions towards those occultists who identified themselves as Satanists and, as such, the journal articulated a distinctly Satanic philosophy and perspective.  However, as the journal evolved and developed, renaming itself as The Heretic and The Nexus in later years, there arose alongside Satanic philosophy an increasing emphases on what could be called esoteric Nazism or esoteric Nationalism.  Given that the editor of The Watcher was Kerry Bolton, a man who has been immersed in New Zealand's Nationalist/neo-Nazi movement since the early 1970s, such an increasingly political orientation was perhaps unsurprising.  This thesis examines the way in which the Order bought Satanic and neo-Nazi ideologies together and the resulting synthesis.  It also looks at the transition from being a Satanic order led by a neo-Nazi to an openly neo-Nazi Order that uses Satanic philosophy to justify and popularise its conception of National Socialism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kerry Bolton</field><field name="subject">neo-Nazi</field><field name="subject">National Socialism</field><field name="subject">Paganism</field><field name="subject">Satanism</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Nationalist</field><field name="subject">New Right</field><field name="subject">Order of the Left Hand Path</field><field name="subject">OLHP</field><field name="subject">Ordo Sinistra Viviendi</field><field name="subject">OSV</field><field name="subject">Order of the Deorc Fyre</field><field name="subject">ODF</field><field name="subject">The Black Order</field><field name="subject">TBO</field><field name="subject">anti-semitism</field><field name="subject">occult</field><field name="subject">Nazi</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Morphodynamics of the Whitianga Tidal Inlet and Buffalo Bay, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Steeghs, Lauren</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this study was to investigate the sedimentation processes within Buffalo Bay, particularly within and adjacent to the Whitianga tidal inlet, in order to ascertain reasons for the shoaling at both the inlet, and the identified shallow zone around Pandora Rock. Comparison of historic bathymetries suggests the ebb delta and ebb discharge channel of the Whitianga tidal inlet are rapidly accreting and the ebb tidal discharge channel is gradually migrating northeast towards Whakapenui Point.  Accretion rates of up to 25 cm y-1 were calculated in the ebb delta and inlet discharge channel area between 1979 and 1995 and aerial photo comparisons suggest the ebb delta area had increased by 400 % between 1990 and 2002.  Results of the hydrodynamic and sediment transport modelling suggest the rapid accretion in the ebb delta vicinity is likely to be caused by a combination of catchment estuary inputs, which are deposited on the ebb tide as the ebb flow decelerates over the ebb delta, and inputs that have been moved south along Buffalo Beach by flood currents and an eddy that forms landward of the ebb tidal discharge.  Residual tidal velocities further suggest a deposition zone in the ebb delta vicinity resulting from opposing currents and the deceleration of currents.  Hydrodynamic modelling results indicate the isolated shallow zone around Pandora rock appears to be caused by a transient eddy in the southern section of Buffalo Bay.  The eddy is formed by the ebb tidal discharge from the inlet.  Accretion probably occurs in the centre of the eddy which moves north as the ebb tide progresses.  Results obtained from a current meter and sediment trap deployed in northern Buffalo Bay suggest suspended sediment transport is minimal in northern Buffalo Bay, only occurring with large wave activity.   Results of the hydrodynamic and sediment transport modelling further demonstrate that this area experiences low flow velocities, and has little interaction with the rest of Buffalo Bay.  The minimal sediment input to this area, combined with the occasional erosion of the seafloor, primarily by wave activity, is thought to have resulted in long term erosion of northwestern Buffalo Bay between 1938 and 1979.  Although the beach and nearshore is eroding, it is likely the addition of sediment would act to stabilise this section of eroding beach.  Renourishment material could be provided by the ebb delta, the southern tip of Buffalo Bay or the isolated sandbar northeast of the inlet entrance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eddy formation</field><field name="subject">numerical modelling</field><field name="subject">DHI</field><field name="subject">Shoaling</field><field name="subject">hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">sediment transport</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In Legal Limbo? The status and rights of detainees from the 2001 war in Afghanistan</field><field name="creator">Vant, Megan</field><field name="description">During the 2001 war in Afghanistan hundreds of people associated with the Taliban or al Qaeda were arrested by United States forces and transported to the Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The legal status and treatment of these detainees has been an ongoing problem over the last five years. The majority have been given no recourse to justice and allegations of inhuman treatment and torture have been frequent. The first issue raised by the incarceration of these people is whether any of them may be entitled to Prisoner of War status. The evidence shows that, in general, the Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters were not lawful combatants, and hence they are not entitled to Prisoner of War status. While the rights of Prisoners of War are well documented and generally uncontested, the rights of people not entitled to Prisoner of War status are not so easily definable. Despite classification as unlawful or unprivileged combatants, the detainees are not in legal limbo - they are still entitled to the benefit of certain fundamental human rights. There are applicable protections under the Fourth Geneva Convention, Additional Protocol I, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the United Nations Convention Against Torture. The main rights upheld by these documents are the right to liberty and freedom from arbitrary detention; the right to a fair trial; and the right to life. Furthermore, there is a requirement of humane treatment and an absolute prohibition on torture. Reports from international humanitarian watchdogs such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch suggest that the United States Government is not upholding the rights held by the detainees. It is essential that the United States Government recognises the fundamental rights owed to the detainees and ensures that they receive the requisite treatment and access to justice.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Afghanistan</field><field name="subject">Guantanamo</field><field name="subject">detainees</field><field name="subject">Taliban</field><field name="subject">al-Qaeda</field><field name="subject">international law</field><field name="subject">extraordinary rendition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distributing the leadership: A case study of professional development</field><field name="creator">Clarkin-Phillips, Jeanette</field><field name="description">This study explores the question of what might be a model of effective leadership for pedagogical change in early childhood education in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Drawing on a framework of gateways for personalising learning constructed by Hargreaves (2004a) and Engestrom's (1999) Activity theory, a case study of a professional development programme is analysed. Entrypoints or gateways for teachers in three early childhood centres to the professional development programme are identified, as are gateways for sustained involvement and continued learning opportunities. The study uses unstructured interviews with a narrative inquiry approach to hear the teachers' stories and the findings of the study are presented in a narrative style in order to capture these voices. The major findings from the study indicate that professional development is a complex interweaving of voices and intentions. There are three key elements of the ongoing personalising learning as a result of involvement in the professional development programme: distributed leadership, teacher voice, and community. The context of early childhood provided unique definitions of the gateways and common elements were found in identifying the entrypoints and features of sustained involvement. The study implies that effective leadership is distributed across the community and the sustaining features of the professional development programme need to be elements of any provision of professional development intent on personalising learning for pedagogical change.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="subject">early childhood education</field><field name="subject">personalising learning</field><field name="subject">gateways</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Work attitudes and well-being among virtual workers</field><field name="creator">Witzel, Marisa</field><field name="description">The present study examined how certain characteristics of flexible work, the home environment, and the individual impact the outcomes of work-family conflict, job satisfaction, organisational commitment, and psychological strain.  	A questionnaire measuring perceptions of control, flexibility, job involvement, family involvement, work to family and family to work conflict, organisational commitment, job satisfaction, family support, physical boundaries, workplace isolation, psychological strain, personality, and demographic information was created and posted online.  An email was circulated to 390 virtual sales employees from one large organisation in the United States inviting them to participate in the study, and 278 people responded.  Results identified characteristics of the type of work, work enivronment, and the individual that are predictive of individual and organisational outcomes. Findings supported hypotheses that control, flexibility, and family support positively impact the outcomes of conflict, satisfaction, and strain for virtual workers.  Job involvement was found as predicted to positively impact work to family conflict, and family involvement was positively related to family to work conflict.  Contrary to predictions, a negative relationship was found between job involvement and strain, suggesting that those who identify more highly with their job also experience less strain. Consistent with earlier studies, workplace isolation was associated with reduced job satisfaction and organisational commitment (Marshall, Michaels, and Mulki, 2007). In line with boundary theory (Voydanoff, 2005), it was hypothesised that the presence of physical boundaries between work and non work domains would significantly impact measures of conflict and strain for virtual workers. However, results indicated no significant effects. A comparison of perceptions of work-family conflict between individuals with children at home and those without illustrated no significant differences between employees with children at home and those without.  Speculated explanations for inconsistent findings are addressed in the discussion chapter.	Work to family conflict was predicted to mediate the relationship between flexibility and job satisfaction for virtual workers, and analysis supported the presence of partial mediation.  Family to work conflict was also predicted to mediate the flexibility and job satisfaction relationship, however, results were not significant in this case.  Uses of workspace (i.e. for work, leisure, family activities, etc.) were tested as mediator for the relationship between family to work conflict and job satisfaction, and results did not support a mediation effect.  	In sum, findings of this study identify sources of both positive and negative outcomes for people working from home.  Although individuals' experiences working virtually differ greatly, this study identifies common  challenges and issues they face.  By pinpointing the sources of conflict, satisfaction, commitment, and strain in the home office, organisations and individuals can take steps to protect workers against negative outcomes, and maximise positive outcomes.  Implications and limitations of this study are discussed in the final chapter.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">virtual work</field><field name="subject">telecommuter</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">work-family conflict</field><field name="subject">organisational commitment</field><field name="subject">psychological strain</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher Educators' and Pre-service Teachers' Attitudes, Knowledge and Understanding on Special Education and Inclusive Education in the Solomon Islands.</field><field name="creator">Simi, Janine</field><field name="description">Since the merging of special education and regular mainstream education into a unified system now known as inclusive education, this concept has kept many educators divided. However, it appears that inclusive education has now become the preferred option where children with special needs are given equal opportunity to learn with their peers in inclusive classrooms and an environment where they can freely interact with one another. While the seed of inclusive education had been sown and effectively implemented in most developed countries, it has yet to sprout in the Solomon Islands.  It has been suggested that the success of inclusive education depends very much on teachers and their attitudes.  Because of that, teachers need adequate training in inclusive education so that they can effectively implement inclusion in their classroom, thus highlighting pre-service training of teachers as an essential factor which may enhance inclusive education in the Solomon Islands. 	This study was based on an interpretive research paradigm. A qualitative research approach methodology was used.  Teacher educators and pre-service teachers from a teacher training college were identified to be the focus of this study.  It aimed to investigate their attitudes, knowledge and understanding on special and inclusive education and to find out if the current training is making adequate provision for these two approaches to occur.  The primary source of data collection was the use of semi-structured interviews, done through face to face interview followed by a focus group interview.  Interview questions were developed for both teacher educators and pre-service teachers.  The focus group interview involved all participants. According to the literature, school organisation, leadership, pre-service training and staff development together with policy and funding are just some factors that can contribute to the success of inclusive education.  The results suggested that teacher educators and pre-service teachers appeared to have limited knowledge and understanding on what constitutes special education and inclusive practices.  There was also a lack of sound policy at the government level that would pave the way for inclusive education in the Solomon Islands.  This situation had created a gap between inclusive education policy and practices in the country.   Because of lack of policy at the nation level, it had also affected the way other institutions like the School of Education perceived inclusive education.  This was evident in that, the notion of educating children with special needs in an inclusive classroom and environment was never introduced to pre-service teachers in the course of their pre-service training at the School of Education (SOE).  That was the hallmark of this study. This study suggests that firstly, it is very important for teachers to understand the importance of teaching children with special needs in an inclusive environment. Secondly, this notion of teaching children with special needs in inclusive classroom should be introduced into the curriculum of pre-service training for beginning teachers. Thirdly, all stake holders need to have a change of mindset to create a positive attitude to special education and inclusive practices.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Special education</field><field name="subject">Inclusive education</field><field name="subject">Solomon Islands</field><field name="subject">Teacher educators</field><field name="subject">Pre-service teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Equilibration of D-Glucaric Acid in Aqueous Solution</field><field name="creator">Brown, Jolene Mary</field><field name="description">Abstract  The equilibrium of aqueous D-glucaric acid was investigated via Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The NMR spectra of all four species (D-glucaric acid, D-glucaro-1,4-lactone, D-glucaro-6,3- lactone and D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-lactone) were assigned.  A 1H NMR spectroscopy method was developed to investigate the kinetics of equilibration of the starting species (D-glucaro-1,4-lactone and D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone). The equilibration was investigated under neutral conditions as well as conditions with increasing acidity. Each experiment set contained 50-100 1HNMR spectroscopy experiments that were run on the same sample using a program that built in delays. Dimethyl sulfoxide was used as an internal standard, and its signal size was used as a scale to report the changes in relative concentration of the four species throughout the experiment sets.  Under neutral conditions D-glucaro-1,4-lactone is relatively stable against equilibration, while D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone is not. Under acidic conditions both compounds equilibrate within approximately 30,000 seconds. After equilibration under acidic conditions D-glucaric acid is the dominant species, while the relative concentration of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone is slightly higher than that of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone. The relative equilibrium concentration of D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone is low.  A mechanism for the equilibration of aqueous D-glucaric acid was proposed and equilibrium constants and estimates of rate constants were derived from the experimental data. These rate constants were used in MATLAB simulations that were compared to the experimental data. MATLAB simulations were used to alter the rate constants to improve the fits between experimental data and simulated data.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">D-glucaric acid</field><field name="subject">NMR</field><field name="subject">Equilibration</field><field name="subject">Lactone</field><field name="subject">MATLAB</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2452</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Comparison of Multi-instance Learning Algorithms</field><field name="creator">Dong, Lin</field><field name="description">Motivated by various challenging real-world applications, such as drug activity prediction and image retrieval, multi-instance (MI) learning has attracted considerable interest in recent years.  Compared with standard supervised learning, the MI learning task is more difficult as the label information of each training example is incomplete. Many MI algorithms have been proposed. Some of them are specifically designed for MI problems whereas others have been upgraded or adapted from standard single-instance learning algorithms.  Most algorithms have been evaluated on only one or two benchmark datasets, and there is a lack of systematic comparisons of MI learning algorithms.  This thesis presents a comprehensive study of MI learning algorithms that aims to compare their performance and find a suitable way to properly address different MI problems. First, it briefly reviews the history of research on MI learning. Then it discusses five general classes of MI approaches that cover a total of 16 MI algorithms. After that, it presents empirical results for these algorithms that were obtained from 15 datasets which involve five different real-world application domains.  Finally, some conclusions are drawn from these results: (1) applying suitable standard single-instance learners to MI problems can often generate the best result on the datasets that were tested, (2) algorithms exploiting the standard asymmetric MI assumption do not show significant advantages over approaches using the so-called collective assumption, and (3) different MI approaches are suitable for different application domains, and no MI algorithm works best on all MI problems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">multi-instance learning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Narrative of Flippy Johnson: The Three Act Structure - Criticisms and Alternatives Script and Script Analysis</field><field name="creator">Davison, Brad William</field><field name="description">In this feature screenplay, I have incorporated the complexities of an intertwining multi-strand narrative, while manipulating the materials of time and space. This has enabled me to begin my exploration into finding a suitable structure in which to tell a story that features a number of characters, all of whom are intended to represent some of human nature's darkest emotions. I have attempted to distinguish my script from the standard three-act structure. However, I do believe it is a fundamental requirement to know all the rules of a classical three-act structure in order to subvert its conventions. The three-act structure has long been a successful model for transmitting a story to the screen. It has provided the basis for many a film where a character triumphs over adversity; where good defeats bad and heroes fall in love. But what about characters that are not heroes? Protagonists who cannot be defined under the even broadest definition of heroism? Can these people thrive within the strict guidelines of a three-act structure, with its strong reliance on a hero's journey? Is there an alternative structure that can deal with these characters, a structure that can incorporate them in a narrative? This MA will attempt to answer these questions, while also investigating if the materials of time and space can be manipulated and understood when working outside the guidelines of a formulaic structure. The materials of time and space are unique to all films and they are both dealt with in different ways by screenwriters and filmmakers alike. Temporal and spatial characteristics have been studied in depth by many critics including, of particular importance to this MA, David Bordwell. Bordwell has used time and space as a way of making sense of narrative and of engaging with a film. This is something that I am attempting to achieve in the following script and commentary. Furthermore, I will try to articulate the manipulation of time and space, with the challenges of multiple strands of narrative and multiple protagonists.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">screenplay</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) as a Predictor of Risk Taking in Adolescent and Adult Male Drivers.</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Mark Adam</field><field name="description">Abstract  Young drivers between the ages of 15 and 24 are overrepresented in automobile crash statistics worldwide. Despite the common assumption that young drivers are more at risk of crashing than older drivers due to inexperience, age appears to be the main factor influencing crash risk, even after experience has been taken into account. It is possible that young drivers are involved in a high number of crashes because of their risk-taking tendencies. Accident involvement is not so much influenced by errors and lapses by the driver, but by the willingness to commit driving violations intentionally. However, studies that attempted to measure the risk-taking tendencies of drivers have so far used mainly self-report questionnaires, which are limited in their ability to predict real-world behaviour. This thesis used a new behavioural measure of risk-taking known as the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). In this task, participants engage in computer simulation where a balloon is pumped in order to accumulate money, but when the balloon is pumped too high it explodes, and the money that could have been gained is lost. A group of 50 male drivers were the participants of this study, and these were separated into three age groups: adolescents, aged 16-17, young adults, aged 20-21, and older adults, aged 25 years and over. In addition to the BART, the participants answered a series of questionnaires that focused on risk-related constructs, such as impulsiveness and subjective risk assessment, as well as driving attitudes and intentions. The expectation was that younger drivers would be shown to have greater risk-taking tendencies than older drivers. The results showed that the BART showed no relationship with either driving attitude scores (apart from a small correlation with attitudes towards close following), or any of the self-reported measures of risk. The other self-report risk measures, however, showed many correlations with various aspects of driving attitudes and intentions. Over age groups, the level of impulsiveness was found to decrease, and the attitudes became less in favour of taking physical risks. Adolescents were also found to be more approving of using a cell phone while driving, and of overtaking in risky circumstances. They had greater intentions to commit violations in the future, and were more likely to get a thrill from driving. The failure of the BART to reveal any significant findings may have been because so far it has only been shown to correlate with self-reported real-world behaviour, and not so much with attitudes and risk-related constructs. The other suggestion of this thesis was that the BART does not simulate risk-taking in the truest sense because there are no specific negative consequences for risk taking, only the removal of a possible benefit. The finding of greater risk taking in adolescent drivers was discussed in relation to Risk Homeostasis Theory and Problem Behaviour Theory, with a focus on how age-related factors might influence driver risk taking. As further discussed, these age-related factors might include the effect of incomplete brain development, the motives for driving, and the lifestyle of the individual.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BART</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">risk-taking</field><field name="subject">drivers</field><field name="subject">male</field><field name="subject">adloescents</field><field name="subject">adults</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">self-report</field><field name="subject">Risk Homeostasis Theory</field><field name="subject">Problem Behaviour Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2455</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stakeholders' perception of their participation in environmental education in tanzania</field><field name="creator">Mtaita, Upendo Yonnah</field><field name="description">Environmental education (EE) has been an evolving field which came out of concern for the environment in the 1960's and 1970's. As a focus of international conferences and agreements, it impacted on school curricula in most parts of the world, although, for Tanzania, it is a new field in formal education and an often challenging one. With the influence of contemporary focus on participation in EE, in 2004 the Ministry of Education in Tanzania suggested the integration of environmental education into every subject in the curriculum. However, little is known currently in Tanzania about the response of people who have a stake in education to this suggestion, and in particular about their participation in EE. This study sought to explore stakeholders' views of involvement and participation in EE in Tanzania. The three specific questions in this study related to stakeholders' views on EE; stakeholders' perceptions of their roles and involvement in EE; and stakeholders' perceptions of collaboration in the implementation and development of EE in schools in Tanzania. The study adopted an interpretive methodology framework. Purposeful sampling strategy was used and the sampled participants consisted of two schools, 100 students, seven teachers, four school leaders, 56 parents, three government and two EE agencies officials, all from the Dar es Salaam region, Tanzania. The methods used for data collection included semi-structured interviews with teachers, school leaders, government, and EE agency officials and open-ended questionnaires with students and parents. Data analysis followed qualitative and quantitative procedures. The findings of this study indicated that the views and teaching of EE amongst participants was limited to education about the environment. Little emphasis was given to education in and for the environment. Roles and involvement with EE related activities focused on teaching about the environment, and training teachers, while only a few respondents indicated involvement with activities that reflected ii environment action such as cleanliness, planting trees and gardening. The challenges with respect to the implementation of EE were noted to be limited time, and resources, and lack of training and funds. Participants considered that through collaboration stakeholders in Tanzania can contribute their resources in terms of time, funds and expertise and participate to enhance EE initiatives and developments, e.g. training of teachers, improving teaching, children's learning and behaviour, and supporting school-community developments e.g. take an issue-based approach to address local problems, etc. It appeared that success of collaborative initiatives depends on the participation and commitment of individuals; cooperation and coordination of resources and expertise, as well as leadership. The findings highlight several implications and suggestions for future research such as the need for support for stakeholders in Tanzania to develop an understanding of the contemporary focus of EE; teacher support to challenge their current practices and use active teaching and learning pedagogies; leadership support to initiate and sustain collaborative culture in schools; stakeholders' collaboration in EE initiatives; flexible curricula to allow issue-based and action oriented approaches; as well as community involvement in curricula decisions and school collaborative activities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indigenous Development and Self-Determination in West Papua: A Case Study of the Socio-Political and Economic Impacts of Mining upon the Amungme and Kamoro Communities of West Papua.</field><field name="creator">Hisada, Toru</field><field name="description">Since West Papua was colonized by Indonesia in 1963, West Papuans have endured one of the most disastrous experiences of cultural and environmental destruction, human rights abuses and mass killing of the twentieth century.  In the Western Highlands of West Papua, where Freeport McMoRan, a mining company from Louisiana, United States (U.S.), operates, there have been long-standing disputes over environmental justice, human rights, the right to control development, and wealth distribution.     Substantial research has been done on the negative impacts of the Freeport's operation on the Amungme and Kamoro communities who reside in the company's operating area.  Yet, limited research has been done regarding Freeport's social policies and the possible solutions to the issues which are crucial for the further development of Amungme and Kamoro.  Therefore, the thesis firstly examines Freeport's recent social policies which have attempted to address the two communities' concerns as well as the social problems the company has caused around its operating area.  The examination suggests that genuine reconciliation between Amungme and Kamoro communities and Freeport is a crucial next step in achieving successful community development in the area.  The thesis employs a case study of the South African reconciliation processes via Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) to explore the prospects of achieving successful community development in Freeport's operating area of West Papua which might lead to prosperity for the Amungme and Kamoro peoples.    In addition to this, the prospect of preventing the human rights violations by the Indonesian Military (Tentera Nasional Indonesia-TNI) is considered.  The TNI, by carrying out the role of protecting the Freeport operation, has until today committed a large number of human rights violations against indigenous West Papuans around the mine thus preventing and inhibiting the future development of Amungme and Kamoro communities.  Since major countries, including the U.S., the United Kingdom (UK), New Zealand and Australia, have until today, supported the Indonesia state and the TNI, the attitude of Pacific Island states towards the issue is examined.  Finally, although the above processes are important, the study suggests the more important role of the Amungme and Kamoro themselves in taking responsibility for their plight and taking positive actions wherever possible to solve the issues surrounding them.  Although the conflict continues to the present day, the research contained in the thesis outlines the situation in West Papua only up until November 2006.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Amungme</field><field name="subject">Kamoro</field><field name="subject">LEMASA</field><field name="subject">LEMASKO</field><field name="subject">Freeport</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">TNI</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2457</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation into Landing Approach Visual Illusions</field><field name="creator">Reynolds, Natalie Beth</field><field name="description">This experiment was designed to examine aspects of human visual perception during approaches to a runway. The runway width illusion has commonly been reported to contribute to the dangerous tendency of pilots to fly low approaches to runways that are wide and high approaches to runways that are narrow. Attempts to prevent the runway width illusion have not attempted to identify the ideal location for an indicator of altitude. Thus the present experiment examined the effect of varying runway width and manipulated scenes in order to determine whether the runway width illusion was present and where participants were focusing their attention in the scenes. Thirty-two non-pilot participants and 3 pilots took part in the experiment and viewed static and dynamic scenes of runways that were narrow (30.48m), medium (60.96m) or wide (91.44m) at one of three viewing heights low (30.48m), medium (45.72m) or high (60.96m). After viewing scenes, participants were required to estimate their altitude and aim-point. The results of this experiment revealed that participants were fairly inaccurate at estimating altitude and were inclined to overestimate aim-point, however the data also indicated that there was a robust runway width illusion that was present across static and dynamic trials and in both altitude and aim-point data. The standard marking on the runway in an attempt to prevent the runway width illusion was not effective at preventing incorrect altitude estimations but did assist participants to estimate aim-point. It was also found that the objects that participants' most commonly reported using to estimate altitude in the visual scene were located in the lower segment of the scenes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aviation</field><field name="subject">static</field><field name="subject">dynamic</field><field name="subject">aimpoint</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">visual illusions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2458</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Body Image Attitudes amongst M&#257;ori and Pakeha Females</field><field name="creator">Ngamanu, Robert Errol</field><field name="description">Research has shown that body image plays a principle role in predicting the occurrence and extent of eating disordered symptomatology. The term 'body image' has multiple definitions but is most commonly used to refer to self-perceptions of body weight and shape. Evidence shows that Western socio-cultural beliefs encourage females to strive for an extremely thin, unrealistically small figure. The difficulties obtaining this  thin-ideal  have lead to the development of body image dissatisfaction (BID). Because the thin-ideal is a Western construct, BID was thought to effect only Western, White women, however, research shows that body image concerns and consequently eating pathology are appearing in non-Western, ethnic minority groups where they were once unknown. This has been attributed to increasing contact between ethnic minority groups and Western cultural mores. This would suggest that the degree of attachment a minority individual feels towards their ethnic identity is likely to moderate the development of BID and thus eating concerns. This thesis compared levels of body image dissatisfaction amongst ethnic groups in New Zealand, focussing particularly on M&#257;ori and Pakeha. No differences were found to exist amongst these groups with regards to body image dissatisfaction and eating pathology regardless of ethnic attachment. The information found has consequences for clinicians working with clients of M&#257;ori extraction and those researching body image dissatisfaction in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">body image</field><field name="subject">eating disorder</field><field name="subject">eating pathology</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Pakeha</field><field name="subject">ethnic minority</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning Instance Weights in Multi-Instance Learning</field><field name="creator">Foulds, James Richard</field><field name="description">Multi-instance (MI) learning is a variant of supervised machine learning, where each learning example contains a bag of instances instead of just a single feature vector. MI learning has applications in areas such as drug activity prediction, fruit disease management and image classification.  This thesis investigates the case where each instance has a weight value determining the level of influence that it has on its bag's class label. This is a more general assumption than most existing approaches use, and thus is more widely applicable. The challenge is to accurately estimate these weights in order to make predictions at the bag level.  An existing approach known as MILES is retroactively identified as an algorithm that uses instance weights for MI learning, and is evaluated using a variety of base learners on benchmark problems. New algorithms for learning instance weights for MI learning are also proposed and rigorously evaluated on both artificial and real-world datasets. The new algorithms are shown to achieve better root mean squared error rates than existing approaches on artificial data generated according to the algorithms' underlying assumptions. Experimental results also demonstrate that the new algorithms are competitive with existing approaches on real-world problems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">multi-instance learning</field><field name="subject">multiple-instance learning</field><field name="subject">generalized multiple-instance learning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2460</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Saturated: a study in fat obsession</field><field name="creator">Cowley, Natalie Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis examines both contemporary and historical meanings surrounding human body FAT in order to illuminate, chiefly, the forces that have rendered it both an omnipresent and negative entity in Western societies.  It explores the apparent contradiction that we must exist amidst hyper-consumptive capitalism yet display no bodily evidence of such consumption.  Along with an investigation into alternative bodily conceptions to that of the hegemonic West, a discourse analysis is employed to challenge the key assumptions that underpin the current 'obesity epidemic' and its ensuing 'war on obesity' so that body FAT may be configured differently.  It is shown that, because bodily conceptions and ideals are complex cultural constructions, body FAT, as a substance, is not the scourge it is presently portrayed, but rather a substance that signifies most of what consumer society despises and fears.  It is argued that the 'war on obesity' has not been successful, and will continue to be ineffective, because the focus should not be on losing body FAT but rather on the conditions of poverty that generate overall ill-health.  It is concluded that such a 'war', if sustained in its current fashion, will only serve to further malign the situations of those deemed 'overweight and obese'.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fat</field><field name="subject">bodies</field><field name="subject">consumption</field><field name="subject">obesity</field><field name="subject">bodily conceptions</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A process for melt grafting itaconic anhydride onto polyethylene</field><field name="creator">Hanipah, Suhaiza Hanim</field><field name="description">Currently, extensive research in using bio&#8208;derived polymers is being done, highlighting the importance of sustainable, green polymeric materials. Some sustainable alternatives to synthetic polymers include lignin, starch, cellulose or blends of these with petroleum&#8208;based polymers. In New Zealand, large quantities of animal derived proteins are available at very low cost, making it ideal as a sustainable alternative to petroleum&#8208;derived polymers. However, the processability of most proteins is very difficult, but can be improved by blending with synthetic polymers, such as polyolefins. To improve, the compatibility between these substances, a functional monomer could be grafted onto the polyolefin chain. Using an appropriate functional group, the polyolefin could then react with certain amino acids residues in the protein. Lysine and cystein are the two most appropriate amino acid residues because of their reactivity and stability at a wide pH range. In this study, free radical grafting of itaconic anhydride (IA) onto polyethylene was investigated. IA was selected because it is capable of reacting with polyethylene and amino acid residues, such as lysine. The objective of the research was to identify and investigate the effect of reaction parameters on grafting. These were: residence time, temperature, initial monomer concentration as well as peroxide concentration and type. Grafting was characterized in terms of the degree of grafting (DOG), percentage reacted and the extent of side reactions. The reaction temperature was taken above the melting point of the polyethylene, monomer and decomposition temperature of the initiator. It was found that above 160 C polymer degradation occurred, evident from sample discolouration. A higher degree of grafting can be achieved by increasing the initial monomer concentration up to a limiting concentration. The highest DOG achieved was about 1.2 mol IA per mol PE, using 2 wt% DCP. When using 2 wt % peroxide, the limiting concentration was found to be 6 wt% IA, above which no improvement in DOG was achieved. It was found that DCP is much more effective at grafting, compared to DTBP because DTBP is more prone to lead to side reactions than DCP. iv It was found that a residence time of 168 seconds resulted in the highest DOG, corresponding to 4 extrusions in series. However, it was also found that an increase in residence time resulted in an increase in polymer degradation. The tensile strength of PE decreased after two extrusions when using DTBP, and three extrusions, when using DCP. Young's modulus decreased only slightly, while all samples showed a dramatic decrease in ductility, even after one extrusion. It was concluded that degradation had a more pronounced effect on mechanical properties than cross&#8208;linking, and residence time should therefore not exceed three extrusions in series, which corresponded to about 126 seconds. It can be concluded that a high reaction temperature and high initiator concentration lead to a low degree of grafting, accompanied by high cross&#8208;linking and increased degradation. On the other hand, high monomer concentration and high residence time lead to a high degree of grafting. Optimising grafting is therefore a trade off between maximal DOG and minimising side reactions such as cross&#8208;linking and degradation and optimal conditions do not necessarily correspond to a maximum DOG. Other factors, such as the use of additives to prevent degradation should also be investigated and may lead to different optimum conditions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">itaconic anhydride</field><field name="subject">melt grafting</field><field name="subject">extrusion</field><field name="subject">polymer modification</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2462</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fast Algorithms for Nearest Neighbour Search</field><field name="creator">Kibriya, Ashraf Masood</field><field name="description">The nearest neighbour problem is of practical significance in a number of fields.

Also, many techniques, including the old and popular ones, can be implemented in a number of ways, and often the different implementations of a technique have not been thoroughly compared either.    This research presents a detailed investigation of different implementations of two popular nearest neighbour search data structures, KDTrees and Metric Trees, and compares the different implementations of each of the two structures against each other. The best implementations of these structures are then compared against each other and against two other techniques, Annulus Method and Cover Trees.

Commonalities among these schools that repeatedly or consistently present as 'at risk'  may indicate a need for greater or different support or intervention. Self managing schools, while effective for many schools, may not be a workable and sustainable proposition for others. This may well be particularly true for those schools identified as 'at risk'.  This paper considers ERO's process to identify schools 'at risk' and subsequent interventions employed by MOE to support the Principal and Board of Trustees in addressing improvements required within the school. Statistics and document analysis were used to extract data from documents with findings presented as a series of tables. It seeks a match between what is identified by ERO and the Statutory Intervention engaged by MOE. It explores the commonalities of schools under Statutory Intervention and on Supplementary Review. Practice in other countries is also considered in an effort to understand and contextualise the ideas and beliefs that support these approaches.  While there is evidence ERO identifies teacher and Principal performance as major areas of concern, lead issues for Statutory Interventions in the same schools focus on the performance of the Board of Trustees as those with the responsibility of governing the school. The focus on governance to improve school performance is not working for some schools, more or different support may be necessary to effect positive change. The balance between capacity building, incentives and accountability for all involved in schools with Statutory Interventions, appears necessary for those with the capacity to improve.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statutory Intervention</field><field name="subject">MOE</field><field name="subject">Ministry of Education</field><field name="subject">Supplementary Review</field><field name="subject">Education Review Office</field><field name="subject">ERO</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2464</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical Investigation of NMDA Effect on the Cerebral Cortex</field><field name="creator">AL Saidi, Waleed Hamdan Khalfan</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the dynamical behaviour of incorporating NMDA (an excitatory neurotransmitter) for the electrodynamic model of the cerebral cortex. The model used is the mean-field model developed by Steyn-Ross et al. (2005) which describes the behaviour of the cortex in terms of parameters averaged over spatially localised populations. The behaviour of the model is determined by the four control parameters: inhibitory effect li, subcortical drive s, and NMDA neurotransmitter e ect set by an excitatory factor le and the magnesium concentration C. Adopting this model could give a better understanding of the cortex functionality and the anaesthetic mechanism. The model predicts that there are either one or three stationary states available to the cortex. We identify two of these with highly activated state and a quiescent state and focus on the transition between the two. Theoretical stability predictions (eigenvalue analysis) verified by a numerical simulation show that the system is unstable between the two Hopf bifurcations. In addition, in the stable region the steady states remains stable under a small perturbation, while in the unstable region either a transition between states or a limit cycle (oscillation) occurs depending on the position of the steady state.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NMDA  Effect</field><field name="subject">Cerebral Cortex</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2465</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Worry Domains, Perceived Stress and Social Anxiety Among Tertiary-Level Students in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Richards, James Desmond</field><field name="description">Contemporary research into the health concerns of students is sparse, particularly in New Zealand. Overseas literature indicates that students in tertiary education institutions may be at increased risks for physical health problems, stress-related syndromes and emotional dysfunctions. Of particular concern are anxiety disorders as, in addition to their negative impact on quality of life, they are associated with impaired academic performance and poorer educational outcomes.     Skilled, educated individuals are a social asset and it is therefore surprising that so little interest has been paid to the ways in which involvement with the tertiary education impacts on student welfare and anxiety levels. As a first step towards redressing the lack of health data for tertiary populations, this thesis investigates aspects of anxiety among students at a New Zealand university. The primary research aims were to establish an estimate of the levels of anxiety experienced by students and to outline the requirements of tertiary study that students perceive to be the most anxiety-inducing. To achieve the former, students (n = 1,082) were invited by e-mail to participate in an online psychometric survey; to explore the latter, discussion groups were arranged wherein students (n = 18) were asked to talk about their anxiety-related experiences.     Anxiety has many forms and can be conceptualised in a number of different ways. In recognition of the diverse nature of tertiary study, it was decided that a broad framework would be needed to thoroughly investigate the ways in which it might manifest in tertiary student populations. Thus, a tripartite conceptualisation was constructed, viewing anxiety in cognitive, physiological and interpersonal terms. Specifically, the study assessed worry, stress and social anxiety among tertiary students and invited participants to comment on personal experiences in each of these areas.     Comparing study data to norms for student populations in America revealed that New Zealand tertiary students report greater levels of worry, stress and social anxiety than their American counterparts. Within-group comparisons were made as a function of student gender, age, school of study, ethnicity and birth status. Significant differences on at least one survey measure were noted within each of these categories, with the exception of school of study. The possible implications of and explanations for these findings are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">worry</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">social anxiety</field><field name="subject">university students</field><field name="subject">college students</field><field name="subject">student health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Students with Osteogenesis Imperfecta:  A Comparative Intergenerational Study of Inclusive Participation in New Zealand schools.</field><field name="creator">Holmes, Heather Jeanette</field><field name="description">Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic condition commonly known as Brittle Bones. The purpose of this study was to listen to and document the experiences of those with OI to investigate if there were barriers to inclusive education for students with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Persons with OI are often small in stature, have limited strength and varying degrees of mobility. Adventurous behaviour or everyday activities may result in fractures. Often in the world of disability the focus is on the medical condition rather than the personal experiences of those with the condition. This study provided an opportunity to articulate the personal experiences of the participants.  In this study two specific aspects of educational experiences were examined. The first aspect explored was the way students managed physically within the educational setting, while the second aspect examined how students coped emotionally. Five major questions were used to determine if special education policies have affected the quality of inclusiveness for students with OI in New Zealand classrooms over a period of forty years. These questions examined what barriers exist in the past and whether the same barriers still exist within today's educational setting. The questions investigated what or who may be the cause of these barriers and what possible effects these barriers might have on the student The present situation was compared with the past and finally how might these barriers be overcome was investigated.  This qualitative study focused on three individuals, each representing a different generation. The participants exemplified a particular phenomenon, specifically the daily school lives in New Zealand of those with OI. The difficulties these students faced were explored through semi-structured interviews to encourage the three participants to voice their individual experiences. All three participants gave freely of their thoughts in an articulate, thoughtful and open manner, sharing both their positive and unpleasant experiences.  This study revealed that some New Zealand schools have yet to implement recent inclusive education policies set out by the Ministry of Education. The three participants identified barriers to inclusive education from their own personal perspectives. The physical environment of school presented challenges. Distance between classrooms and assembly halls and accessibility to the playground, ramps and toilet facilities created difficulties for students with OI who did not walk independently. Attitudes of parents, teachers, and the wider school community impacted on the self-attitude of students with OI. Over-protection, fear and anxiety were identified as unintentional attitudes that placed limitations on participation of meaningful activities and added to student feelings of isolation and difference. Lack of knowledge of the medical and psychosocial aspects of students with OI could account for the continued barriers imposed by some teachers.  Barriers do still exist in some New Zealand schools for students with osteogenesis imperfecta. Improved access could result in more participation. More participation could allow for an improved quality of social interaction and thus result in greater focus on the person and less focus on the disability. Collaboration between all school staff, parents and students with OI is essential to minimise barriers and maximise academic and social opportunities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Osteogenesis imperfecta</field><field name="subject">physical disability</field><field name="subject">barriers</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">environmental</field><field name="subject">inclusive education</field><field name="subject">qualitative study</field><field name="subject">collaboration</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2467</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of relatedness, social contact, and sex on observational learning in rats (Rattus norvegicus)</field><field name="creator">Tulloch, Bridget</field><field name="description">Kin recognition is the ability to identify a conspecific as a relative and can occur even when animals are complete strangers.  By being able to recognise relatives, animals are able to give preferential treatment to those with which they share genes.  Recognition may occur by either direct familiarisation (learning a phenotypic cue that reliably correlates to kinship), or by indirect familiarisation (learning kinship relationships through previous encounters).  Rats (Rattus norvegicus) can recognise kin, however to what degree kin recognition is mediated by genetics (direct familiarisation) or social relationships (indirect familiarisation) are unknown; the influences of kinship and familiarity on the ability to learn from a conspecific is also unknown.  Furthermore, the sex of an animal can also influence its ability to learn but this effect has received little attention in the literature, particularly when considering observational learning tasks.  I assessed if relatedness and/or familiarity influenced a rat's ability to learn through observation, and if gender relationships influence the learning process.  Eighty rats ( observers ) were given the opportunity to observe a  demonstrator  rat press a joystick in a given direction to obtain a food reward.  Observers watched a demonstrator that had one of the following relationships with them: related and familiar, related and unfamiliar, unrelated and familiar, or unrelated and unfamiliar.  When observers were given the opportunity to manipulate the joystick, the number of sniffs of the joystick, the latency to first move the joystick and the total number of presses were recorded.  Rats that were both familiar and related to the demonstrator consistently performed better than any other treatment group; furthermore, rats that were familiar with the demonstrator performed the task more efficiently than rats that were not familiar with the demonstrator.  When the demonstrators and observers were related, the observers produced more presses and sniffs of the joystick while having a lower latency to the first push   In addition, male observers learnt better than females regardless of the demonstrator sex, with males that were familiar to their demonstrator making nearly twice as many pushes than any other treatment group. The results from this study are discussed in relation to both the mechanisms of direct and indirect recognition and the potential adaptive value on kin discrimination in the learning process.  The home range hypothesis may explain why gender differences in learning were found: male rats have larger home ranges than females.  Male rat will regularly encounter more rats than females and would need to ascertain if unfamiliar individuals are relatives.  Females remain closer to natal sites and as such are more likely to encounter kin and therefore may not need as well as developed kin recognition ability.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rats</field><field name="subject">kin recognition</field><field name="subject">kin discrimination</field><field name="subject">observational learning</field><field name="subject">sex differences</field><field name="subject">direct familiarisation</field><field name="subject">indirect familiarisation</field><field name="subject">spatial recognition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2468</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between leadership styles, perceived control and psychological ownership</field><field name="creator">Li, Tian</field><field name="description">This study investigates the relationship between leadership styles (e.g., taskoriented, relationship-oriented and participative leadership style), perceived control, psychological ownership of the job and several volunteers' work attitudes.

Furthermore, these M&#257;ori views were included in culturally adapted parent-training programmes.  The overall aim was to devise an approach to emphasise client strengths and provide best outcomes for research participants.  Qualitative aspects included discussing the research processes in the M&#257;ori community by acknowledging the roles of whanau, hapu (sub-tribal), and iwi (tribal) structures.  I also identified the importance of pan-tribal and urban M&#257;ori groups in the current research.  As the project developed, an ongoing consultation and feedback protocol was established to ensure that M&#257;ori views on the research and the written outcomes were recognised.  In-depth interviews with kaumatua (elders), and focus groups with M&#257;ori service providers and M&#257;ori parents were analysed qualitatively to establish M&#257;ori values in child rearing and parenting, and the knowledge and skills that contribute to effective parenting and family functioning.  Values identified from these participants confirmed the central role of whanaungatanga (family connections), whakapapa (genealogy), and awhinatanga (support) for M&#257;ori. Two culturally adapted parent-training programmes, the Matuatanga (Parenting) Relationships Model and the Matuatanga Values Model programmes, were developed and compared with a Standard Parent Training programme.  The Matuatanga Relationships Model programme emphasised the importance of child, parent and whanau relationships and interactions.  The Matuatanga Values Model programme emphasised M&#257;ori values derived from the qualitative data - whanaungatanga, whakapapa and awhinatanga.  A range of pre- and post-training measures were undertaken to identify acceptable and appropriate measures for quantifying parent-training outcomes.  These included questions on support networks, parent expectations of children, parental self-efficacy, parental self-rating, critical-incident scenarios, and programme evaluation.  While 78 participants attended at least one of the research sessions 22 participants provided pre- and post-training measures for the Whanau Whakapakari programmes.  Results showed that there was a medium effect size improvement across all Standard Parent Training and Matuatanga Model programmes and a statistically significant improvement in the Standard Parent Training and Matuatanga Relationship Model programmes.  There were no statistically significant differences between the outcomes of the different programmes but qualitative differences from evaluation and feedback data were considered in identifying specific skills acquisition, general understanding and enjoyment components in the programmes.  Results from the different measures indicated that parent expectations and critical-incident scenario measures provided the most information on post-training changes.  Analysis of the outcome data with the attendance patterns confirmed the value of parent-training programmes per se and indicated that at least in the short term, parent effectiveness scores continued to improve for participants who continued to attend for more than one programme.  Programme follow-ups considered natural whanau supports in the M&#257;ori community and issues of social and cultural validity.  Integration of standard parent-training concepts and cultural concepts suggest a multi-dimensional approach which recognises parenting skills acquisition and cultural validation of whanau concepts relevant to parenting for M&#257;ori.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Whanau Whakapakari</field><field name="subject">Maori-centred</field><field name="subject">Parent-training</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Family</field><field name="subject">Families</field><field name="subject">Parenting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2470</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Analysis of Recreational Drugs in Biological Specimens Using Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry</field><field name="creator">Lucas, Natasha</field><field name="description">In the last few years, the prevalence of legal party pills in New Zealand has risen dramatically. These pills contain new piperazine designer drugs, two of the more common being 1-benzylpiperazine (BZP) and m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP). This thesis describes an optimised LC-MS/MS method for the detection of BZP and TFMPP in whole blood, using an automated solid phase extraction (SPE) for sample clean-up. The method was validated on three different days using five replicate samples each day. The standard curve was linear from 7 - 7000 ng/mL for BZP and 10 - 10,000 ng/mL for TFMPP, with coefficients of variation (CV) below 10%, and accuracy greater than 90% for both drugs. The method was used to quantitate samples provided by the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand. Blood levels were used to show concentrations in the blood over time, and relate these to performance of subjects on a driving simulator. The study was stopped after 41% of the participants who received BZP and TFMPP had adverse reactions to the pills, including vomiting and migraines.  The LC-MS/MS method was also used to detect and quantitate methamphetamine, amphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine, morphine, codeine and 6-monoacetylmorphine in hair. The drugs were extracted from 20 mg of hair using hydrochloric acid in a water bath overnight, then purified using SPE. Validation on three days with five replicate samples gave coefficients of variation (CV) below 12% and acceptable accuracy for all drugs. The method was tested on three samples, previously reported by Environmental Science and Research (ESR) using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) giving results in good agreement.  This thesis describes a sensitive, accurate, reproducible LC-MS/MS method easily adapted to analyse drugs of abuse in different biological matrices. It demonstrates the versatility of LC-MS/MS and its applications in forensic work.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Benzylpiperazine</field><field name="subject">BZP</field><field name="subject">Trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine</field><field name="subject">TFMPP</field><field name="subject">Party Pills</field><field name="subject">Recreational Drugs</field><field name="subject">LC-MS/MS</field><field name="subject">SPE</field><field name="subject">Amphetamines</field><field name="subject">Opiates</field><field name="subject">Blood</field><field name="subject">Hair</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2471</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical Investigations: A Primary Teacher Educator's Narrative Journey of Professional Awareness</field><field name="creator">Bailey, Judith (Judy) Lyn</field><field name="description">Over a period of twenty months a mathematics teacher educator uses narrative inquiry, a form of story-telling, to investigate her professional practice in working alongside pre-service primary teachers. Two main themes emerge in this research. The first of these centres around the use of mathematical investigations as a vehicle for supporting pre-service primary teachers to consider what the learning and teaching of mathematics may entail. As part of this process the author personally undertook several mathematical investigations. This resulted in significant learning about previously unrecognised personal beliefs about the nature and learning of mathematics. These beliefs were discovered to include ideas that  'real' mathematicians solve problems quickly, do so on their own and do not get stuck. Surprisingly, all of these subconscious assumptions were contrary to what the author espoused in the classroom. A consequence of this learning included some changed beliefs and teaching practices. One such change has been moving from a conception of mathematics as a separate body of 'correct' mathematical ideas, and where the emphasis when doing mathematics was on attaining the correct answer, to now viewing mathematics as a sense-making activity involving discovering, doing and communicating in situations involving numbers, patterns, shape and space. Thus, mathematics is now perceived to primarily be found in the 'doing' rather than existing as a predetermined body of knowledge. As such one's interpretations of a mathematical problem are important to consider.  Changes in teaching include using mathematical investigations as a teaching approach with the belief that students can effectively learn mathematical ideas using this approach; an acceptance that this may involve periods of being 'stuck' and that this does not mean that the teacher needs to immediately support the students in becoming 'unstuck'; more in-depth interactions, including questioning, to support this mathematical learning; and an acceptance that mathematics can be learned by people working in a collaborative manner.  The second theme encountered in this narrative inquiry involves the exploration of narrative as a powerful means with which to pursue professional development. Narrative inquiry, including a mention of differing forms of narrative writing, is described. Issues also considered include the place of reflection in narrative; the notion of multiple perspectives that are encountered in qualitative research such as this; issues of validity and authenticity; a consideration of what the products of narrative research might be and who may benefit from such research; a brief mention of collaboration; and the place of emotion in qualitative research. The concept of change occurring within a narrative inquiry is not seen to imply an initial deficit position. Rather the research process is regarded as the building of a narrative layer that supports and grows alongside the writer's life as it occurs (Brown  Jones, 2001). Thus there is not a seeking of perfection or an ideal, but a greater awareness of one's professional practice. The results of narrative research therefore, are not definitive statements or generalisations about an aspect of that which is being researched (e.g., Winkler, 2003). As such, a definitive statement about how to be a teacher of pre-service students learning mathematics is not offered. Rather, a story is shared that may connect with the stories of the reader.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematical investigations</field><field name="subject">pre-service teacher education</field><field name="subject">narrative inquiry</field><field name="subject">pre-service primary teachers</field><field name="subject">nature of mathematics</field><field name="subject">teaching practice</field><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural Endocrinology of Breeding Adelie Penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae)</field><field name="creator">Ninnes, Calum Edward</field><field name="description">Measuring hormonal changes is vital for understanding how the social and physical environment influences behaviour, reproduction and survival. Various methods of hormone measurement exist, potentially explaining variation in results across studies; methods should be cross validated to ensure they correlate. I directly compare faecal and plasma hormone measurements (Chapter 2), and use the most suitable endocrine measure to test the Darling hypothesis (Chapter 3) - that breeding is hastened and synchronized in larger colonies due to increased social stimulation (mediated by the endocrine system). Blood and faecal samples were simultaneously collected from individual Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) for comparison, and assayed for testosterone and corticosterone (or their metabolites). Sex differences and variability within each measure, and correlation of values across measures were compared. For both hormones, plasma samples showed greater variation than faecal samples. Males had higher corticosterone levels than females, but the difference was only significant in faecal samples. Plasma testosterone, but not faecal testosterone, was significantly higher in males than females. Correlation between sample types was poor overall, and weaker in females than in males; perhaps because measures from plasma represent hormones that are both free and bound to globulins, whereas measures from faeces represent only the free portion. Faecal samples also represent a cumulative measure of hormones over time, as opposed to a plasma 'snapshot' concentration. Faecal sampling appears more suitable for assessing baseline hormone levels. In the second study I examined, over two seasons, whether the timing of breeding varied with colony size; larger colonies present occupants with higher levels of social stimulation and are predicted to show earlier, more synchronous breeding. Baseline faecal hormone levels throughout the breeding season, and survival, were measured to investigate possible proximate and ultimate mechanisms for the results. The influence of environmental variability was examined, by relating the timing of breeding, survival, and endocrine changes to sea ice conditions. Colony size did not influence the timing or synchrony of breeding, survival, or hormone levels within years; perhaps because colonies in an Adelie rookery are not independent from the 'social environment' of adjacent colonies. Across years, synchrony in the smaller rookery was higher than in the larger rookery. The scale of these comparisons may exceed the applicability of the Darling hypothesis. Therefore, no support was found for the Darling hypothesis, at the colony or rookery level, in this species. Higher corticosterone metabolite and lower sex hormone levels in the first season correlated to later breeding and lower survival compared to the second season. This is likely due to the persistence of extensive sea ice conditions late into the first season. Researchers should take care in selecting the most appropriate method of hormone measurement for their question. Future studies testing the Darling hypothesis must carefully select their definition of a colony (i.e. a truly isolated social unit) and the scale at which the hypothesis is tested. Combining endocrine measurements with behavioural, survival, and environmental information allows for a more comprehensive interpretation of animal ecology.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adelie penguin</field><field name="subject">hormones</field><field name="subject">breeding</field><field name="subject">synchrony</field><field name="subject">faecal</field><field name="subject">EIA</field><field name="subject">sea ice</field><field name="subject">colony size</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2473</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing Artistic Integrity: An Exploratory Study</field><field name="creator">Barbour, Kim Jaime</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the concept of artistic integrity. A historical foundation for artistic integrity is laid to provide a context within which eight artists' constructions of the concept can be placed. To date, little research has been conducted to discover how artists feel about artistic integrity, despite the fact that the concept is used frequently both in the popular media, and in arts and creative industries policy and research. Secondary research into European Romanticism and the growth of the creative industries traces the complex development of artistic integrity through to contemporary New Zealand. Grounded by an internal-idealist ontology, a subjectivist epistemology, and an interpretive paradigmatic framework, qualitative, semi-structured interviews with eight artists were conducted to investigate how artistic integrity is perceived by those working within the New Zealand arts environment. The multifaceted nature of the history of artistic integrity is mirrored in the complexity of the responses from the artists involved in this research. Key themes to emerge from the analysis of the interview data were the personally constructed and contextual character of artistic integrity, its importance to the artists involved, and its social contestation. However, the opinions offered on these themes were often very different, and occasionally even contradictory. The artists' responses illuminate how differently artistic integrity could be interpreted throughout the creative community, and question the validity of current uses and definitions of the concept. Most importantly, this research provides an opportunity for artists to offer their understandings of artistic integrity, as surely it is artists who should be determining the validity and meaning of their integrity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">artistic integrity</field><field name="subject">creative industries</field><field name="subject">Romantic Movement</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">artists</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic Resources, Equity and International Law</field><field name="creator">Guneratne, Camena Erica</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the application of international law to the uses of agricultural crop plants termed plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. In particular, it asks the question,  does international law regulate the use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture so as to enable equity among nations in accessing these resources and sharing the benefits which arise from them? In answering this question this thesis will also consider several related issues which have arisen in the course of the international debate on this topic. These resources are closely entwined with the lives and livelihoods of certain categories of peoples such as indigenous peoples and farmers and local communities. In addition, they are critical for the economies, agricultural systems and food security of nations. The thesis question will not be considered in the abstract, but will rather be placed against the background of these issues, which will be continuously used to put the legal discourse into perspective.  The legal analysis will focus on five international agreements which directly or indirectly regulate the use of crop plants. These five agreements are placed in two broad categories, i.e. environmental/conservation agreements and trade and property related agreements. The first category includes the Convention on Biological Diversity of 1992 and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of 2001. The second category includes the Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants of 1991, the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights of 1994, and several treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organisation. In addition, since the topic raises issues of rights, certain human rights treaties and documents will also be used in the analysis.  The current international conflict over plant genetic resources can be condensed into one of rights, human rights and property rights. The international treaties cited above have all contextualized the issue within a framework of property rights, setting out mechanisms for different forms of legal control of these resources. This thesis will argue that whatever the form and nature of such property rights, they cannot achieve equity in the use of crop plants. Rather the use of such rights results in violations of human rights.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant genetic resources for food and agriculture</field><field name="subject">international law</field><field name="subject">intellectual property rights</field><field name="subject">equity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Peer Processes and Adolescent Behaviour</field><field name="creator">Pope, James George</field><field name="description">While research suggests that peer influence can lead to increases in undesirable behaviours of adolescents, there has been little focus on the specific mechanisms of influence. A relatively small literature examining social interactions between peers has found that the discussion of rule breaking topics by pairs of boys relates to how much problem behaviour the boys engage in. This research is limited by its reliance on a set of similar samples from a North American population base. This thesis explored the relationship between social interaction and behaviour with sample from New Zealand Aotearoa. Nine pairs of Year 10 boys were recruited primarily from two high schools. A half-hour conversation was video taped for each pair. These conversations were coded on the basis of the nature of the talk between pairs of participants following the coding system proposed by Poe, Dishion, Griesler and Andrews (1990). The coded behaviours were analysed and compared to measures of previous rule breaking behaviours. The duration of rule breaking talk was found to correlate with the level of previous rule breaking behaviour.

This work is a good example of how statistics can be applied to toxicology to enable conclusions and inferences to be made about important areas of interest such as the drugs and driving situation in New Zealand.  Two thousand uninjured drivers (Study 1) who had provided an evidential blood alcohol sample, were also tested for cannabis, methamphetamine, benzodiazepines and morphine to determine the incidence of drug use by drinking drivers. To determine the proportion of drivers killed in car crashes who had used drugs and/or alcohol, two hundred and twenty nine fatally injured drivers (Study 2) were tested for alcohol, cannabis, methamphetamine, morphine, benzodiazepines and neutral and basic medicinal drugs that might have an effect on driving performance. Alcohol, cannabis and their combination were found to be the most prevalent drugs used by drivers. The analytical methodologies used were developed and validated by the Institute of Environmental Science and Research Ltd., where this work was carried out. These techniques involved liquid-liquid and liquid-solid extractions, immunoassays and chromatographic techniques for screening and confirmation assays. The statistical analysis of the results was done under the supervision of the Institute's biostatistician.  An approach to cannabis culpability, intended to elucidate the role of this drug in car crashes, was applied to the Study 2 results. The number of samples collected during one year of research was not sufficient to enable statistically robust conclusions to be drawn.  Cannabis use is illegal in New Zealand but drugs (different to alcohol) are not regularly tested at the roadside. This work as part of a cross-departmental project titled  Drinking and drugged driver control: delineating the problem  is expected to support the establishment of strategies designed to reduce the road toll and possibly include the screening of non-alcohol drugs in serious and fatally injured drivers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drugs and driving</field><field name="subject">drugs in New Zealand</field><field name="subject">cannabis</field><field name="subject">culpability analysis</field><field name="subject">drugs involvement in car accidents</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2477</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Administration Service for the Tourist Information System (TIP)</field><field name="creator">Hsieh, Ping-Ju</field><field name="description">The modern day tourists do not want to deal with the hassle of using a large number of travel guides and paper maps while travelling.

A.</field><field name="description">Three subspecies of house mice of different geographic origins have reached New Zealand; M. m. domesticus (10 haplotypes), M. m. musculus (1 haplotype) both from Europe, and M. m. castaneus (3 haplotypes) from Asia.  Identifying the sources of the multiple historical introductions of the house mouse is a complex issue, particularly during the peak colonisation period of 1830-1880.  The early European settlers came with many bags, crates, plants, seed and livestock, which provided ample travel opportunities for stowaway rats and mice. With the assistance of volunteers, I have collected mice from various locations throughout the New Zealand region, to confirm the previously recorded haplotypes and to look for evidence of hybridisation between the colonising subspecies.  Morphological characteristics traditionally used for identification of subspecies were compared with genetic characters, to establish whether the use of morphology is still a viable method of identifying subspecific distinctions between mice in New Zealand. While no M. m. musculus haplotypes were found among these samples, some mice still had the coat colouration typical of M. m. musculus.  Data from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) markers revealed some surprising results.  I have found six new M. m. domesticus haplotypes, and three new M. m. castaneus haplotypes.  The data have also revealed extensive hybridisation, particularly between M. m. domesticus and M. m. castaneus.  The finding of the new haplotypes supports the previous assumption that there were multiple introductions of mice into New Zealand, but the finding of M. m. castaneus in inland towns and cities does not support the associated assumption that European mice were initially the only mice present in New Zealand.  Rather, the wide distribution of M. m. castaneus suggests that this subspecies probably arrived during the early nineteenth century.  The house mouse has long been recognised as an ideal organism for hybridisation studies, and the finding of a hybrid zone within New Zealand would provide an excellent opportunity to extend our knowledge of hybridisation and gene transfer.  Previous studies found M. m. domesticus in Napier, and a M. m. musculus/M. m. castaneus hybrids in Wellington.  A systematic sampling programme was undertaken between Wellington and Napier following State Highway 2 (SH2), in an attempt to locate a hybrid zone. Analysis of mtDNA and nDNA showed that, M. m. castaneus was found as far North as Dannevirke, and M. m. domesticus as far South as Featherston.  There was also extensive evidence of integration of M. m. domesticus nDNA markers into mice with M. m. castaneus mtDNA.  There was no clear support for a hybrid zone, but this does not mean that one has not existed in the past and that it has since been overrun by movement of mice with humans and their goods. Identification of subspecies by morphological characteristics, while used with confidence in other countries, is of little use in New Zealand.  Extensive hybridisation/and or introgression between the subspecies has long since blurred any morphological distinctions the colonising mice may have had.  I propose that these physical characters should be used in support of genetic analysis of the subspecies.  The official classification of the New Zealand house mouse currently stands as M. m. musculus, however, data collected does not support this and it is proposed that the official classification should be changed to M. m. domesticus.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mus musculus</field><field name="subject">phylogeography</field><field name="subject">hybridisation</field><field name="subject">introgression</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Helping Families Change Childhood Obesity</field><field name="creator">Thomson, Alison</field><field name="description">The prevalence of childhood obesity is increasing at an alarming rate and is implicated in the onset of serious and life threatening health problems of both a physical and psychological nature.  The current research comprised of three main components.  Firstly, the reliability of a readiness to change questionnaire was examined, which had been completed by parents of obese children enrolled in the Bodywise childhood obesity programme.  Secondly, an analysis of outcome data from 36 families who completed the above programme was also undertaken in order to determine if the data identified their stage of change, as defined by the questionnaire  Thirdly, four semi-structured interviews were conducted with families involved with the Bodywise programme.  These parents provided information related to their experiences of lifestyle change, including what initiated change, what assisted change, and what barriers to change they had encountered.  Findings revealed that in accordance with the transtheoretical model the readiness to change questionnaire was a reasonably reliable instrument for indentifying parents' readiness to change their child's eating patterns and physical activity levels.  Analysis of the outcome data from the 36 families revealed individuals in the action stage of change for both eating and physical activity made more rapid change at the outset of the programme than individuals in earlier stages of change.  In addition, information derived from the interviews with families identified several promoters and barriers to change, many of which were similar across families.  Until now no studies have examined the application of the transtheoretical model to an intervention for childhood obesity.  Previous research has shown support for the model's use with other health problems.  Overall this study lends support for the utility of the transtheoretical model in childhood obesity intervention.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">childhood obesity</field><field name="subject">readiness to change</field><field name="subject">transtheoretical model</field><field name="subject">Bodywise programme</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2480</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Challenge to Fijian Methodism - the vanua, identity, ethnicity and change</field><field name="creator">Degei, Sekove. Bigitibau</field><field name="description">Christianity is the dominant religion in the Fiji islands today. However, this was not the case in the early eighteen hundreds. Back then, the Fijians had lived a life and culture of their own that was not known to the world. This all changed when different groups of Europeans started to arrive in the early eighteen hundreds.  Of these, the group that had the most influence on the Fijians was the English Wesleyan missionaries. The result of their evangelism was the establishment of the Methodist church in 1835.  This church is the dominant denomination in Christian Fiji and has been closely meshed with concepts of Fijian identity. However, the church's dominance is being challenged, partly because of the entwining of concepts of church and the vanua (land, people). Additionally the arrival of other, new denominations with their different ideologies has also affected the standing and influence of the Methodists.  In this thesis the way in which the missionaries had introduced themselves to the Fijians and how they influenced and converted them to Christianity are outlined.  This was not a one-way affair, where only the missionaries' ways of living and ideologies were involved.  They first had to accept the structure and some of the customs of the vanua before their mission could proceed. It was found that the influence and ideologies brought by the missionaries was incorporated into the vanua ideologies and has formed the basis of what became the Fijian way of life. When Fiji became a colony of Britain in 1874, the incorporation of the vanua and Methodist Christian ideologies and structure was well established. However, all these views, and the previously accepted local views of Fijian culture, have changed in response to the challenges from the new denominations.  The effect of these new approaches and ideologies on the vanua and the Methodists in Fiji is discussed. The outcome of this on-going situation is not yet clear.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fijian Methodism</field><field name="subject">vanua</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">challenge</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact on Hamilton Abuse Intervention Project of government policy changes-an investigation</field><field name="creator">Haley, Caryl Rosemary</field><field name="description">This research investigates the perceptions and viewpoints of staff working for the Hamilton Abuse Intervention Project (HAIP) as to the impact of changes in government policy. Established in 1991 HAIP is a coordinated community response to domestic violence based on the Duluth Model. Over the last two decades governments in New Zealand have introduced policies and strategies to combat violent crime in the community predicated on the understanding that addressing violence within the family/whanau setting will assist in breaking the cycle. This research focuses on the impact of strategies which advocated inter-agency collaboration such as the VIP Pol400 Project (Pol400 Project) established in 2001 with HAIP as the lead agency. (VIP is an abbreviation standing for Violence Intervention Project). The research also set out to test the hypothesis that working within an environment marked by the introduction of policy changes and new strategies has a significant impact upon a social services agency such as HAIP.  In view of the inherent complexity of investigating perceptions and viewpoints qualitative methodology was chosen for this research. Ten of the fourteen people employed by HAIP contributed to the research. Semi-structured face to face interviews and the written answers from questionnaires provided a detailed body of information which informed the narrative and descriptions of this study. An outline of relevant legislation, policy initiatives and strategies introduced over the last two decades was provided to give a framework for the study.  Each of the respondents commented on issues related to funding and workload. Inadequate funding was seen to be adding to already heavy workload which continued to grow aggravated by the demands of compliance and accountability. Respondents identified some aspects of HAIP which had been affected by lack of adequate funding such as the loss of the 24/7 Crisis Line and difficulties with maintaining the parallel development policy. However, In spite of funding shortfalls respondents noted that HAIP's services continued to expand and examples were given of recent initiatives such as the establishment of home support groups. Several respondents identified the Pol400 Project as being significant development in HAIP's services. Respondents commented on its value in closing gaps in the criminal justice system's response to incidents of family violence. A detailed analysis of the Pol400 Project using archival material and using statistics from the HAIP Pol400 database demonstrated the comprehensive extent of the inter-agency collaboration.   The findings of this investigation showed that respondents regarded inadequate funding and increased workload as impacting significantly on their work. However, apart from comments made in relation to some negative impacts on HAIP of the Domestic Violence Act of 1995, respondents rarely made a specific connection between these issues and their relationship to changes in government policies. This study showed that since the Pol400Project began in 2001 reported incidents of family violence and subsequent referrals rose steadily but the data showed a marked increase in activity following the involvement in 2005 of a Family Safety Team. The increase in the intake of reports was attributed, in part, to the police addressing gaps and shortfalls in their own systems. The impact of the Pol400 Project on HAIP was seen, in the main, to be contributing positively to HAIP's role in providing a seamless coordinated community response to family violence.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pol400 project</field><field name="subject">Te Rito</field><field name="subject">domestic violence</field><field name="subject">family violence</field><field name="subject">interventions</field><field name="subject">the Duluth Model</field><field name="subject">HAIP</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2482</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relation between preference and demand for litter substrates in the domestic hen</field><field name="creator">Harris, Aimee Rebecca</field><field name="description">Six hen's preferences between 5-min access to each of two litter substrates, sand and sawdust, were measured using dependent concurrent VI 60 s VI 60 s schedules of reinforcement.  The obtained preferences were small and idiosyncratic.  Demand functions were generated separately for each of the two substrates by requiring the hens to perform under increasing FR schedules.  The demand functions were disorderly, some were linear, some were of mixed elasticity, and others curved upwards.  No clear relation between the individual hens' preference and demand measures was found.  The overall response rates, running response rates and average post-reinforcement pause durations were atypical compared to previous demand research, possibly due to low levels of reinforcer collection, but were similar for individual subjects in both demand conditions.  During the demand assessment, dustbathing took place in a similar proportion of reinforcers for each substrate.  During the preference assessment, a greater proportion of dustbathing took place during sand reinforcers.  Individual hens did not consistently dustbathe more in their preferred substrate.  It was argued that the inconclusive results were a product of the substrates used.  The atypical demand functions, response rates and average PRP durations may have been due to behaviour that was not schedule related occurring during key time (i.e., the subjects may have been continuing a dustbathing bout).  It is possible, that the two substrates were too similar, and thus the subjects did not have a clear preference for one over the other.  In future research preference should be assessed prior to demand, to ensure a clear preference can be obtained, with reinforcers that are qualitatively more different than those used in the present experiment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">preference</field><field name="subject">demand</field><field name="subject">hens</field><field name="subject">dustbathing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2483</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'It Was Hard To Die Frae Hame': Death, Grief and Mourning Among Scottish Migrants to New Zealand, 1840-1890.</field><field name="creator">Powell, Debra</field><field name="description">James McGeoch's headstone, which can be seen at the Presbyterian Cemetery in Symonds Street, Auckland, carries a simple sentiment in the Scottish dialect that resonates with first generation migrants everywhere: 'It was hard to die frae hame'.  This thesis is an investigation into the experiences of death and mourning among nineteenth century Scottish migrants to New Zealand. It considers the ways in which death, and the framework of social conventions through which it is interpreted and dealt with, might provide evidence for the persistence or renegotiation of cultural behaviours among migrant communities.  The focus of this study is on the working classes and in particular those who resided in, and emigrated from, Scotland's larger cities and towns. A complex of ideas and customs informed cultural practices regarding death among the working classes. This thesis highlights the multiple challenges that the process of migration posed to these cultural practices.  The ongoing renegotiation of such ideas and customs were important components in the formulation of cultural and religious identities in New Zealand. This thesis is simultaneously an investigation of deathways, a migration study, a consideration of the working class experience, and a tentative venture into the history of emotion. Using a diverse range of sources, including New Zealand coroners' reports, gravestone inscriptions, and personal autobiographical accounts as written in journals, diaries and letters, this study highlights the complexity and variety of migrants' experiences of death and attempts to uncover the multiple meanings of these experiences.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scottish migration to New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Nineteenth Century</field><field name="subject">Death</field><field name="subject">Mourning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of the Web as a Form of Stakeholder Communication: An empirical case study of a co-operative</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Jennifer Yanan</field><field name="description">This research aims to add some understanding to the existing stakeholder management literature with a focus on the management of stakeholder communication. It explores how the Web can assist the management of the communication between a dairy co-operative and its farmer supplier-shareholders. An exploratory case study and semi-structured in-depth interview research design is used to collect, analyse, and present the perceptions of interview participants. This research highlights a paradox, which results from the inconsistent needs of the farmers as both suppliers and shareholders of the co-operative. A number of factors that have influenced farmer interviewees' decisions to either reject or embrace the Web are also identified. These factors are divided into two categories, those closely associated with individual characteristics, namely, perceived values, perceived self-efficacy, and awareness; and these outside the individual's control, namely, infrastructure and media conflict. These findings suggest that the Web adds flexibility to organisations' stakeholder communication strategies by offering an additional communication form. In particular, this research shows that the Web contributes to overall management of stakeholder communication through 1) increased accessibility to personalised and up-to-date information, 2) added flexibility to self-service programs, and 3) a recreated sense of 'conventional' community. Furthermore, the Web should be used as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, conventional communication forms in stakeholder communication strategies. Although the Web may not be the answer for all stakeholder communication challenges; what seems undeniable is the tremendous potential of the Web in facilitating and leveraging the management of stakeholder communication. Three considerations are proposed for organisations planning to include the Web as part of their stakeholder communication strategy: organisational needs, stakeholder characteristics, and communication media factors. Research limitations are discussed, and recommendations for further study are outlined in the conclusion.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Web</field><field name="subject">stakeholder communication</field><field name="subject">website</field><field name="subject">co-operative</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">communication medium</field><field name="subject">dairy farmer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transformations: Anthropology, Art and the Quilt</field><field name="creator">Wanigasekera, Gwenda Dorothy</field><field name="description">Drawing on both anthropological and quilt literature, this thesis shows the many different ways that made objects are thought about by different groups of people.  Awareness of these differences permits a new perspective of 'Western' art and object making.  This awareness allows a space in which to consider the importance of the process of making.  Quiltmaking provides an interesting case study.  This thesis therefore describes the field of quiltmaking activity that exists in New Zealand at the present time.  This genre, as it is practised today, had its beginnings in the revival that began in this country during the 1970's.  This study will show that the main impetus of this revival did not draw on known traditions in New Zealand, but rather on a largely imported tradition that had developed in the United States of America.  Ideas about the status of quilts as art objects, comes from a mixture of influences.  The tradition of quiltmaking in the United States was already a strong one and had been through a number of revivals.  Aspects of this traditional culture influenced quiltmakers in New Zealand. Simultaneously, there was an equally strong sense of the quilt as an art object in New Zealand.  However, art entrepreneurs in the United States certainly were part of the transformation of the quilt into an art object in that country.  Their strategies of discourse and display drew on contemporary artworld ideologies and ultimately this valuation affected which quilts could be seen as 'art' in New Zealand.  Through the use of participant observation, interviews and a questionnaire, the content of this study will show the many different ways that New Zealand quiltmakers work, their aims and goals for the quilts they make, and the ways these quilts are perceived by other quilters and the wider public.  Some areas that have resulted in conflict and misunderstandings are discussed. As in any such group, conflicts and misunderstandings arise from the existence of different ways of valuing aspects of cultural activities.

To examine this hypothesis, 6 hens were trained in a delayed matching-to-sample procedure at delays of 2 and 4 s. The probability of reinforcement for correct responses was initially 0.9 at both delays until performance stabilised. A generalisation probe was then carried out by inserting unreinforced trials at delays of 0, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4.5, 5 and 6 s in a session amongst normal training delay trials. The generalisation functions had a slight peak around 2 s. After further training, a second generalisation probe showed a slightly declining function. The probability of reinforcement at the 2 s delay was then dropped to 0.1, so that in the terms of the classical generalisation/peak shift paradigm, 2-s delay trials became S&#175; and 4-s delay trials became S+. A third generalisation probe then was conducted. This resulted in a flat function from 0 s to 3 s, and a large, clear peak in discriminative performance at 4.5 s over all hens. After more of the same differential reinforcement training, a fourth generalisation probe showed a broad curve peaking at 3 s, with minima at 1 s and 6 s and a global maximum at 0 s. Another training condition was then run, with the probability of reinforcement at the 2-s delay dropped to 0, to see if increasing the aversiveness of S&#175; would again result in a peak shift. A fifth generalisation probe was then conducted. This showed a sharp decline in discriminability at shorter delays, a dip around 2 s, and a very small area shift beyond 4 s, but no clear peak shift. This was interpreted as being due to overlearning, with the consequences of remembering at S&#175; no longer significantly affecting performance at S+. A final training condition was then run, with S&#175; moved from 2 s to 3 s with zero probability of reinforcement, and for only a short period, to prevent overlearning. It was predicted that this would cause peak shift to re-occur. A sixth generalisation probe was then conducted. This found a further decline in discriminability at shorter delays, a shift in the dip from 2 s to 3 s, and a large, clear peak at 4.5 s. This demonstration of peak shift in a remembering process would not have been predicted by any traditional theory of memory, but strongly supports the conception of remembering as discriminative behaviour along the stimulus dimension of time.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">memory trace</field><field name="subject">delayed matching to sample</field><field name="subject">stimulus control</field><field name="subject">latency to choice</field><field name="subject">discrimination learning</field><field name="subject">animal behaviour</field><field name="subject">animal behavior</field><field name="subject">poultry behaviour</field><field name="subject">poultry behavior</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A whole cord model for the identification of mechanisms for the antivascular effects of DMXAA</field><field name="creator">Moses, Kiriana Mihi</field><field name="description">Endothelial cells form the inner lining of a blood vessel and their structure and functional integrity are important in maintenance of the vessel wall and circulatory function. These cells play key roles in immune and inflammatory reactions by regulating lymphocyte and leukocyte movement into tissues; they are also main targets for antivascular agents in cancer therapy. Endothelial cell responses to different stimuli have been previously investigated using conventional approaches, 'HUVEC in vitro culture system'. In this study an ex vivo perfusion model was constructed and utilized using whole human umbilical cords, in attempts to replicate a more accurate in vivo microenvironment. Assessment of the proportion and duration of endothelial cell viability in the ex vivo model was undertaken using a  MTT 3, (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide viability assay. A time baseline was successfully established for all experimental perfusions. Endothelial cell immune response was assessed through intravenous perfusion of the endotoxin, Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Gene expression profiles revealed a significant increase in expression levels of E-Selctin (E-Sel), Intracellular adhesion molecule (I-CAM) and Tissue Factor (TF) relative to the housekeeping gene Beta 2 Microglobulin. When LPS was administered in combination with Hypertonic Saline  Solution (HSS), expression levels declined indicating HSS interferes with the activation pathway of LPS ultimately suppressing its effectiveness on endothelial cells. HSS impact was also recognized from perfusion experiments on resting endothelial cells. All identified genes were suppressed by HSS apart from inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). As a potential target for antivascular agents, HUVEC were then stimulated with DMXAA and gene responses of Tumour Necrosis Factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;) was analysed. DMXAA demonstrates excellent antivascular acivity in experimental tumours, so tumour conditioned media (TCM) was administered intravenously through umbilical cord segments to replicate a tumour microenvironment prior to DMXAA addition. When cells were stimulated with Tumour conditioned media then administered DMXAA, TNF-&#945; expression was significantly upregulated; relative to the housekeeping gene Human Proteosome subunit Y, however, when the cells were exposed to tumour conditioned media in absence of DMXAA gene expression significantly decreased. Thus, the antitumour action of DMXAA is capable of inhibiting the gene response of TNF-&#945; replicated in a tumour environment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">endothelial cells</field><field name="subject">HUVEC</field><field name="subject">DMXAA</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Fast and the Spurious: Geographies of Youth Car Culture in Hamilton, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Beere, Paul</field><field name="description">quot;Boy racersquot; or quot;hoonsquot; attract extensive media attention and are often the focus of public concern.

Nine interviews were conducted with young M&#257;ori women who had become pregnant and continued with their pregnancy, all before the age of 20. The in depth interviews included questions focusing on the young women learning of pregnancy, the pregnancy, birth, caring for their child and their experiences with education and future plans. Negative experiences were usually those which involved unsupportive people. Positive interactions were those where support, of all types, was offered and useful to my participants and their children. Education was highlighted as the most effective way of providing a better life for adolescent mothers and their children. The research highlights the importance of social support and the continuation of education. Combining the efforts of positive social networks and social support services can improve the lives of adolescent M&#257;ori mothers and their children.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social support</field><field name="subject">adolescent</field><field name="subject">pregnancy</field><field name="subject">M&#257;ori</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2490</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Darkness to dawn?

Te Reo M&#257;ori is a very significant cultural marker for K&#257;p&#333; M&#257;ori to identify themselves as M&#257;ori.  K&#257;p&#333; M&#257;ori face many challenges, challenges that are unknown to the mainstream.  The thesis surveys the fortunes of Te Reo M&#257;ori as it struggles to survive and find acceptance in Aotearoa/New Zealand, outlines attitudes towards disabled persons, who suffer discrimination and marginalisation, and summarises the story of the Blind in Aotearoa/New Zealand, especially through the history of The Royal New Zealand Foundation of the Blind, to provide context for the challenges faced by K&#257;p&#333; M&#257;ori. For K&#257;p&#333; M&#257;ori, discrimination and marginalisation is increased because all M&#257;ori suffer the disabilities that are a result of colonisation.

This study explores the way in which these changes were reflected in sermons preached before the princes.  Five preachers have been selected, one from each reign.  All the sermons were delivered before the reigning monarch in English, and were printed and published shortly afterwards. The Introduction gives a general overview of the thesis.  The subject matter of Chapter 1 is concerned with the funeral oration at the obsequies of Henry VII. Bishop John Fisher focuses his attention on the death of Henry, his contrition for his sins, and his reliance on God, through Holy Church, for the assurance of forgiveness.  Chapter II examines a Good Friday sermon preached at Greenwich Palace before Henry VIII and Queen Anne Boleyn in 1536 by the King's confessor, John Longland. Longland promotes the beliefs and practises of Holy Church notwithstanding Henry's rejection of papal authority.  In Chapter III, Hugh Latimer, the 'Prophet to the English,' preached a series of sermons before Edward VI in the Preaching Place at Whitehall during Lent 1549.  Latimer's aim is to show Edward the path to true kingship and to promote justice in the realm.   The sermons of Thomas Watson, Dean of Lincoln, before Queen Mary at Greenwich in Lent 1554 are the subject of Chapter IV. Watson supported the Queen in her efforts to return England to the true faith. Chapter V analyses the sermon John Whitgift, Dean of Lincoln, preached before Elizabeth I at Greenwich in Lent 1574.  Whitgift refuted Catholic beliefs but reserved his greatest attacks for the radical Protestants.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sixteenth Century Sermons preached in English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2492</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lifting the Veil: Muslim women's adjustment to a New Zealand university</field><field name="creator">Bahiss, Zainab</field><field name="description">Abstract Due to a decline in the number of domestic students in many New Zealand and other foreign Western countries' universities, there is more recruitment of international students. In New Zealand universities, beside the increase in the number of other foreign international students, the number of Muslim international students and especially Muslim women students has increased in the past few years. This is due to internationalisation of New Zealand education and the economic benefits which international students provide to New Zealand economy. The reason for undertaking this study is because as a Muslim women and a student myself, I wanted to investigate the adjustment problems of the increased number of Muslim women international students at the University of Waikato. This is because, it would provide information to researchers, theoreticians and policy developers regarding adjustment issues that might be specific to Muslim women. Unfortunately, this area is under researched; hence this study could assist in filling the vacuum in this area. The literature so far has discussed the adjustment issues of international students in general and from the literature there seems to be two main dominant areas where international students suffer adjustment problems. These two areas are the academic environment of the university and the socio-cultural environment of the university. The academic environment has many elements to which many international students are believed to face adjustment problems such as adjusting to the 'study shock'. On the other hand, in the socio-cultural environment, students are believed to face adjustment problem to the culture shock. However, there are many flaws in the existing literature which results in its weakness and hence the need for this study. In order to discuss the adjustment issues of Muslim women international students' one has to examine the educational background of these students. It is important to also examine the religious and cultural backgrounds of these students because religious beliefs and practices combined with their cultural background have an impact on their adjustment into the foreign academic and socio-cultural iii environment. Islam strongly encourages the acquisition of education for women. Looking at the history of Muslim women, one can find great scholars who achieved enormously from their right to education. However today there is great tension in the Islamic world regarding women's education which makes this issue very complex. This is due to the different interpretations of the Islamic scholars of the verses of the Quran, and Muslim people cultural and tribal codes. Therefore, many Islamic countries have taken different approaches to the education of their female population that is from very conservative to liberal ones. The qualitative approach used in this chapter helped in understanding the perspectives and world views of the respondents which would have not been possible otherwise. The confidentiality and anonymity of the respondents was catered for before conducting the interviews and pseudo names are used in this study to refer to the respondents of this study. This study is however limited in that the time constrain did not allow me to do a longitudinal study in order to discover the many un answered questions or ambiguous sentences. This study has revealed four major themes which were identified through this research as being specifically important to the adjustment of Muslim women international students. These women did not view their adjustment as a huge shift instead for them it required more of gentle shift in their adjustment. The similarities in the academic environment of the international students and that of New Zealand universities made the adjustment to the academic environment even smoother. There are also other positive adjustments these international students make while in New Zealand universities. They are more independent and are able to communicate in English language which for most international students seems to be main reason for coming to Western universities. There is need for the staff and students to understand the religious and cultural beliefs of these international students so that they can help them in the adjustment process. There is also increased need for the universities and policy developers to provide help and support for the international students. iv There are many issues that seemed to need further exploration which this study has not managed to find out. The research needs to be done to discuss the huge emotional or psychological impact on the international students' due to teachers' and local students' lack of knowledge of their religious and cultural beliefs. The researchers also need to investigate how this change in the personality and thinking of women impacts on them when they go back to their home countries. In theorisation, there is need to theorise the adjustments of students who belong to other religious and cultural groups and how it might impact their adjustment process. For the practitioners, there is need to investigate the role of the staff and institutes to clearly identify to the role of staff in how they could make international students transaction to the university smoother.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Muslim</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">adjustment</field><field name="subject">cultural adjustment</field><field name="subject">academic adjustment</field><field name="subject">social</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2493</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of a New Zealand Adult Reading Test.</field><field name="creator">Halliday, Tracey Jaye</field><field name="description">The National Adult Reading Test (NART), developed in Britain is commonly used in clinical settings to estimate premorbid intelligence in New Zealand. Research suggests psychometric tests are more accurate if normed on the population they are used with. This study attempted to establish norms for the original NART based on a New Zealand population and develop a National Adult Reading Test for use with a New Zealand population (NZART). Sixty-four university students were administered the Wechslers Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI), the NART and the New Zealand Adult Reading Test (NZART). A regression equation was developed to estimate premorbid intelligence in this sample. Results indicate fewer errors occur on the NZART than the NART suggesting it may be a better indicator of premorbid intelligence for a New Zealand sample. Furthermore, the NZART was more accurate at estimating premorbid WASI IQ across all three subscales of the WASI at a range of IQ levels. Analyses were also conducted to ascertain the impact of demographic variables. Little overall difference was found in test scores in relation to gender, age or income. Although future studies need to be conducted to validate this new measure, initial results suggest that the NZART may be a more accurate predictor of premorbid IQ in a New Zealand population.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NART</field><field name="subject">psychometric</field><field name="subject">neuropsychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2494</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between Job Variables:  The Moderating Effects of Support and the Mediating Effects of Job Satisfaction, Affective Commitment  and Continuance Commitment in the Support Worker Industry</field><field name="creator">Botha, Hanlie</field><field name="description">The factors associated with employees' work related attitudes and cognitions were examined.  A sample of employees from Community Living Trust (CLT), an organisation within the disability support worker industry, completed a questionnaire that included several measures: supervisor and colleague support, role conflict, role ambiguity and role overload, time-based, strain-based and behaviour-based work-to-family/family-to-work conflict, organisational commitment, job satisfaction and turnover intentions.  The purpose of this study was to explore the extent to which supervisor and colleague support contributed to a reduction in role conflict, role ambiguity and role overload.  In addition, the relationship between support and work-to-family/family-to-work conflict were also explored.  Finally, the organisational outcomes, in particular organisational commitment, job satisfaction and turnover intentions, were examined.  It was found that supervisor and colleague support did, in some cases, moderated the relationship between role stressors, conflict and job satisfaction / organisational commitment.  It was also found that job satisfaction and affective commitment mediated the relationship between the role stressors, WF strain-based conflict and turnover intentions.  The major implications from this research are that human resource initiatives should be developed that aims to identify the support needs employees may have, in order to increase levels of job satisfaction and organisational commitment and decrease levels of turnover intentions.

In modern parlance, one frequently encounters this homespun wisdom in the statement that highly effective schools are led by highly effective principals. This study investigates the perceptions of six practicing principals of the elements of highly effective principalship in Solomon Islands' Community High schools. The study investigates and explores these perceptions and tries to describe the elements of highly effective principalship and the impediments that may prevent principals from becoming effective. The study hopes to contribute towards the possible development of highly effective principalship in the Solomon Islands schools. The finding of this research reveals that although the participating principals were very experienced, their responses indicate that there appeared to be no theory-driven basis for their practice. Similarly, the perceptions expressed reveal the urgent need for the Solomon Islands to pay more attention to leadership development strategies that will see the creation of national, and personal, leadership philosophies and set the process of ongoing leadership development, enhancement and improvement in the country. The proposed strategies must incorporate current international research and literature on educational leadership theories as well as building on current practice in the Solomon Islands that is nationally and culturally appropriate. In addition, the study suggests that current practitioners should be encouraged to engage in educational leadership research and begin to build a national literature base. This study suggests that the process of establishing the notion of highly effective educational leadership in the country's school system should start as soon as possible. Those in policy and decision-making positions must have the courage to implement strategies that will contribute to improved levels of educational leadership in order to raise the quality of education for all learners in the country.

Consuming bottled water is related to ideas of both sustaining the environment and the body. I explore how performances of both the environment and consuming bodies constitute each other. Consumer performances in Hamilton and various visual and textual representations illustrate spatialities, socialities and subjectivities of bottled water consumption.  Geographies of consumption and feminist geographies and methodologies provide the framework for my research. I conducted eleven semi-structured interviews on the Waikato University Campus in Hamilton with participants different in age, gender and ethnicity. Bottled water advertising in international and national lifestyle magazines and newspapers, as well as bottled water websites, are also examined through the lens of critical discourse analysis.  The first part of this thesis focuses on bottled water consumption in regard to the environment and explores how the natural and pure image of bottled water is currently linked to notions of green and sustainable consumption. The second part examines the embodiment of the environment in regards to sustaining healthy, pregnant, sporty, sexed and 'green' bodies while looking at gender, health, and consumer performances and subjectivities.  Linking bottled water consumption to the environment and the body not only enriches geographies of consumption but also emphasises the paradoxes associated with consuming bottled water.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geography</field><field name="subject">Consumption</field><field name="subject">Bottled Water</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Embodied Consumer Performances</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2497</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of New Zealand Marine Organisms</field><field name="creator">Till, Marisa</field><field name="description">The chemical study of three New Zealand marine organisms is described, along with a survey of the chemistry and biological activity of eighty-five marine organisms collected from New Zealand waters. The study of the New Zealand marine bryozoan Pterocella vesiculosa has resulted in the isolation of three new compounds; pterocellin H, pterocellin I and 1-methyl-5-bromo-8-methoxy-&#946;-carboline. These compounds were characterised using high resolution mass spectrometry, one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The biological activity of these compounds was investigated and a discussion of the results including a comparison with the activity of closely related compounds is also presented. The crude extracts of eighty-five marine organisms were surveyed to establish their biological activity and chemical constituents. The results of this study indicated which species had interesting biological activity. The chemical survey allowed geographical and intra-species comparisons of chemical constituents between samples, as well as potentially indicating the presence of known secondary metabolites. For the Pterocella vesiculosa samples the survey methodology clearly illustrated the presence of pterocellins A and B. Two marine organisms were chosen for further investigation based on their biological activity and chemical survey results. Bioactivity directed isolation procedures yielded no new compounds from the organisms.

New Zealand's legislative changes in the Human Rights Act, 1993 and the Employment Relations Act, 2000 makes it unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of age.  In effect, this means the abolishment of mandatory retirement as the individual is now able to exit from the workforce by choice.  For nurses the choice for exiting the workforce occurs noticeably in the 50-54 age group with further declines in subsequent years.  This research study revealed a group of older nurses who valued autonomy in their nursing practice and valued the contribution they made as experienced practitioners in a variety of health sectors in the Waikato.  As the demographic shift in New Zealand's population is towards older age groups and likely to require future nursing care, it becomes essential to retain experienced nurses in the workforce.  This small scale qualitative study interviewed ten registered nurses over the age of 60 to discover how social life was constructed as they aged.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older women</field><field name="subject">workforce</field><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2499</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transnational Tongans:The Profile and Re-integration of Return Migrants</field><field name="creator">Liava'a, Viliami Tupou Futuna</field><field name="description">This study contributes to the 'unwritten chapter' in migration studies, namely transnational return migration, with specific reference to Tongan migrants who have voluntarily returned to live in Tonga.  Return migration of transnational Tongans is not 'permanent' as their mobility pre and post-return is characterised by circulation or repeated return rather than staying at 'home'.  In examining the circulation of transnational Tongans, two new forms of return migration are identified -- 'return for career advancement' and 'ancestral return'.  These additions to a new typology of return migration represent better the contemporary mobility system of transnational Tongans and suggest a means for addressing 'brain drain' through strengthening the 'Tongan-ness' of the diaspora while simultaneously stimulating economic development in the Kingdom.  Despite these positive dimensions of return, re-integration is a 'bumpy' process, and there needs to be a holistic migration strategy if greater numbers in the Tongan diaspora are to return and make their potential contribution to sustainable development in the Island Kingdom.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">voluntary return migration</field><field name="subject">transnational Tongans</field><field name="subject">circular migration</field><field name="subject">repeated migration</field><field name="subject">re-integration</field><field name="subject">return for career advancement</field><field name="subject">ancestral return</field><field name="subject">brain drain</field><field name="subject">brain gain</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">Tonga</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparing Wrong/Right with Right/Right Exemplars in Video Modelling to Teach Social Skills to Children with Autism</field><field name="creator">Dekker, Anna Margaretha</field><field name="description">Research has shown that video modelling can improve social behaviours in children with ASD.  In addition, research in behaviour modelling training from the field of organisational psychology has shown that using a mix of positive and negative exemplars can assist in acquisition and generalisation of a skill.  The current study compared the use of one negative and one positive exemplar, with the use of two positive exemplars to determine which combination would result in faster acquisition and/or superior generalisation of a skill. No other studies have examined this with children diagnosed with ASD. Seven children, aged between 5 and 15 years, and diagnosed with ASD participated in a multiple baseline design across children; within child across two modelling conditions; and within each modelling condition across two tasks. In one condition, a participant watched a video containing one exemplar of a model (same sex and of similar age but with normal development) perform a task the wrong way, and one exemplar of the same model perform the same task the right way (wrong/right).  In another condition, the participant watched a video containing two different exemplars of the model perform a matched task the right way (right/right). During the intervention, 1 participant refused to watch the videos.  For 13 of the 16 tasks, where training was completed, participants either reached criterion or made some gains in acquisition of the social skills.  However, for seven of the tasks criterion was not reached.  Generally, neither modelling condition was superior in acquisition or generalisation of the targeted social skills.  Confounds occurring during the course of the study may have contributed to the equivocal results.  For some children with ASD, video modelling in combination with the delivery of preferred reinforcers may be required for successful skill acquisition.  Further implications, particularly the potential negative effects of vicarious reinforcement when an observer does not gain reinforcement for imitation are discussed, as are recommendations for future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">autism</field><field name="subject">video modelling</field><field name="subject">video modeling</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">modeling</field><field name="subject">positive and negative exemplars</field><field name="subject">multiple exemplars</field><field name="subject">social skills</field><field name="subject">narration</field><field name="subject">vicarious reinforcement</field><field name="subject">imitation</field><field name="subject">observational learning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dispute Resolution and the Retirement Villagers Act 2003: A fair and independent process?</field><field name="creator">Craig, Margaret Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis will explain what an appropriate process for dispute resolution in a retirement village should look like. It will also evaluate how close to that ideal the model contained in the Retirement Villages Act 2003 (RVA) is. It will conclude that the Act model fails because at both steps in its dispute resolution process, it places one of the parties, the operator, in the position of selecting, ensuring independence and paying for a mediator and a disputes panel.  This thesis also finds the lack of legal status for residents' committees deprives residents of a source of support and representation. The linchpin role in the Act, the statutory supervisor, also has a disputes resolution function. This thesis finds the role of statutory supervisor also lacks independence because the selection and payment for the role is placed with the operator. Evidence suggests a large share of the market is  'captured' by one Trustee Company that does not maintain independence from operators and may not communicate with residents at a level appropriate to the age of the resident population; the average age of retirement village residents in New Zealand is 83 years. The thesis also finds that mediation is not a suitable process for people in their later years, especially older women   when the contested matters surround contractual rights and include on-going fees.  The key finding in the thesis is that the Act is not fair or independent for residents.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">retirement villages</field><field name="subject">dispute resolution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intimate Geographies: Bodies, Underwear and Space in Hamilton, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Morrison, Carey-Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the ways in which a small group of young P&#257;keh&#257; women use underwear to construct a range of complex gendered subjectivities. I explore how these subjectivities are influenced by both material and discursive spaces. Three underwear shops in Hamilton, New Zealand - Bendon Lingerie Outlet, Bras N Things and Farmers, and various visual representations depicting contemporary notions of normative femininity, are under investigation Feminist poststructuralist theories and methodologies provide the framework for this research. One focus group and three semi-structured interviews were conducted with young women who purchase and wear underwear. Participant observations of shoppers in Bendon Lingerie Outlet, Hamilton and autobiographical journal entries of my experiences as a retailer and consumer of underwear continued throughout the research. Advertising and promotional material in underwear shops and a DVD of a Victoria's Secret lingerie show are also examined. Three points frame the analysis. First, I argue that underwear consumption spaces are discursively constructed as feminine. The socio-political structures governing these spaces construct particular types of bodies. These bodies are positioned as either 'in' place or 'out' of place. Second, underwear shops can be understood as feminised, young and thin embodied spaces. Bodies that fit this description are hence positioned as 'in' place. However, female bodies that are 'fat' and/or old and male bodies are marginalised within the space and thus positioned as 'out' of place. Third, I consider particular forms of normative femininity by examining the ways in which underwear disciplines and contains the body. Women's underwear moulds and shapes flesh to fit contemporary feminine norms. Examining the specific relationship between the body, underwear and space provides a means to re-theorise geography and makes new ground for understanding how clothed bodies are constituted in and through space.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Female bodies</field><field name="subject">Marginalisation</field><field name="subject">Contemporary feminine norms</field><field name="subject">Abjection</field><field name="subject">Underwear</field><field name="subject">Space</field><field name="subject">Feminist poststructuralist geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Size Exclusion PEGylation Reaction Chromatography Modelling</field><field name="creator">Kapadi, Ajith Nayak</field><field name="description">Size exclusion PEGylation reaction chromatography was investigated using a model developed by Fee (2005). Column dispersion was neglected and the PEGylation reaction was modelled as second order. The model allowed up to four PEG groups to be attached to a protein and accounted for succinic acid hydrolysis from activated PEG. The model was adapted to simulate a-lactalbumin PEGylation and succinic acid hydrolysis from activated PEG in a batch stirred tank so rate parameters from stirred tank kinetic experiments could be obtained and the model verified. The model was solved using finite differences and simulations run in Matlab. The effect of reaction parameters such as timing, length and concentration of PEG and protein injection, reaction rates, and model resolution on model simulation results was explored. In the size exclusion PEGylation simulations it was found that increasing protein concentration increased MonoPEG concentrations and increased the ratio of MonoPEG to starting protein feed concentration. Increasing PEG pulse length and starting PEG concentration initially increased MonoPEG concentration and product ratio until all protein had been PEGylated at which point MonoPEG concentration the product ratio levelled out. Increasing PEG hydrolysis rates did not affect the amount of MonoPEG produced but reduced the activated PEG concentration and increased succinic acid concentration. Optimal conditions for producing MonoPEG were found to be equal concentrations of PEG and protein, with the PEG injection length twice as long as the protein injection, and the PEG injection done immediately after the protein injection.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PEGylation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dancing with the Shadows of Wellbeing: An Exploration of Participatory Action Research Processes as a Catalyst for Transformation of Staff Wellbeing</field><field name="creator">Bentley, Rosemary Diane</field><field name="description">My abiding concern with human and planetary wellbeing and an emerging interest in the potential of Participatory Action Research as a method of engaging with restorative, life-enhancing ways of being are central to the research reported here. Chomsky (2003), Kelsey (2002), Roddick (2001), and Stiglitz (2003) are amongst many authors who argue that the way in which we shape and are shaped by our relationships with one another has contributed to an intolerable, inhumane and unsustainable compromise of human and planetary wellbeing.  Through a Participatory Action Research (PAR) project with staff from Te Ra, a community based on the holistic ideals of Rudolf Steiner, and thus an organisation explicitly committed to holistic wellbeing of people and planet, we sought to explore the challenges to such wellbeing.  While our mutual attention was focused on enhancing staff wellbeing at their place of employment, my wider attention was also given to an investigation of the value of a critical analysis to the wider political and economic context in which this organisation works to meet the aspirations of this community. My deep attention has also focused on the potential for PAR to make a contribution to the transformational aspirations of critical theorists who are concerned to uncover and transform aspects of society that inhibit justice and wellbeing of people and planet. My metaphor of choice, to allow me the engagement in all three spheres simultaneously, is the metaphor of Dance. In my work with the staff of Te Ra, our intent was to 'dance with the Shadows', alluding to Jungian references to hidden aspects of ourselves and this community, to discover if un-wellness and disconnection from self and others could be transformed into flourishing relationships and wellbeing in the organisation. McNiff (2000) proposes that PAR has the potential to generate living theories that redefine the main purpose of organisation theory in terms of human wellbeing. Throughout this research project, principles of PAR are woven in with work of critical organisational theorists, psychologists and anthropologists. The already established ideas of reflection, observation, reflexivity, and action are choreographed with the less often considered ideas of those aspects of the research relationship that may inhibit mutuality.  While this organisation is explicitly and deeply committed to underpinning all that is aspired to with a relational ethic, the impact that instrumental practices associated with an intensifying neo-liberal economic external environment have not left this organisation untouched.  It took commitment, courage and resources to identify and engage with the Shadows masked by intrinsic and extrinsic pressures and processes that these research participants were experiencing.  Engaging in PAR processes allowed us dance 'up close and personal' with their aspirations to begin transforming what was not well, while recognising and reinforcing the organisation's existing strong philosophical and spiritual foundations that emphasized individual freedom and collective responsibility for wellbeing of all.  Based on the significant transformations achieved during this project we posit that PAR provides a collaborative opportunity for academics and practitioners to 'dance with the Shadows' of individuals and communities to make a significant contribution to the development of sustainable relationships in workplaces where human and planetary wellbeing is the priority.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wellbeing</field><field name="subject">Participative Action Research</field><field name="subject">neo-liberalism</field><field name="subject">Shadows</field><field name="subject">dance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading Comprehension Instruction of Effective Grades 5 and 6 Saint Lucian Teachers</field><field name="creator">Sargusingh-Terrance, Lisa Merlene</field><field name="description">This study set out primarily to investigate the nature of reading comprehension instruction in Saint Lucia, and to examine the explanations of teachers with regard to the factors that they perceive contribute to Grade 6 students' failure in the main idea comprehension test in the national Common Entrance Examination in Saint Lucia.  Four effective Grades 5 and 6 teachers (two per grade) from two Saint Lucian primary schools participated in a total of four individual semi-structured interviews and were observed in their regularly scheduled reading comprehension lessons.  A total of 27 lessons were observed and audio tape-recorded to examine the nature of reading comprehension instruction in the classrooms.  From this cohort of lessons, a sample of 16 lessons was randomly selected and transcribed to determine the presence of direct instruction in comprehension strategies, and the quality of instruction that took place. This quality was measured and described in terms of the elements of the Direct Instruction Model (Pearson  Dole, 1987), the nature of questioning, and time allotted to instruction. This data was also used to make comparisons between Grades 5 and 6 classes.  The results show that the four teachers perceived that there are four areas of blame for students' poor performance in reading comprehension: the teacher's inability to instruct, the students' poor decoding and comprehension abilities, the inadequacy of the main idea test, and the teaching materials available for teaching comprehension.  However, the main factor perceived by teachers as contributing to the students' poor performance is teachers' inability to instruct.  Nonetheless, the observation of the Grades 5 and 6 effective teachers' reading comprehension lessons showed that these teachers were indeed teaching a number of comprehension strategies.  They relied predominantly on the question answering strategy in all their lessons which was mainly taught in combination with other strategies.  However, it was the teaching of summarization through the main idea that was the dominant strategy more explicitly taught in 7 of the 16 lessons observed, appearing more frequently in the Grade 6 classes.  An assessment of the quality of the reading comprehension instruction revealed that 11 of1 6 lessons, included all the four elements of direct instruction, and were rated as 'excellent' in quality.  None of the lessons had fewer than two elements identified on the model.  An assessment of the types of questions asked also showed that questioning was used both for the purpose of assessment and as an instructional strategy.  The timing of the lessons support the quality of instruction, as 90% of the total time observed was allotted to instruction.  The greater portion of that time went to guided practice (38%) and independent practice (33%) of reading comprehension strategies.  This study shows that explicit comprehension instruction of strategies is evident in the reading comprehension classes of the 4 effective Saint Lucian Grades 5 and 6 teachers.  It is therefore recommended that educational officials ensure that similar practices are maintained in other Saint Lucian classes, that the reading comprehension instruction practices of a wider cross section of Saint Lucian teachers be examined, and that future research looks into other probable causes of students' failure on the main idea comprehension test.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reading Comprehension Instriction</field><field name="subject">Saint Lucia</field><field name="subject">Comprehension Strategies</field><field name="subject">Direct Instruction</field><field name="subject">Upper primary grades</field><field name="subject">Main Idea</field><field name="subject">effective teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reinforcement Learning for Racecar Control</field><field name="creator">Cleland, Benjamin George</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the use of reinforcement learning to learn to drive a racecar in the simulated environment of the Robot Automobile Racing Simulator. Real-life race driving is known to be difficult for humans, and expert human drivers use complex sequences of actions. There are a large number of variables, some of which change stochastically and all of which may affect the outcome. This makes  driving  a promising domain for testing and developing Machine Learning techniques that have the potential to be robust enough to work in the real world. Therefore the principles of the algorithms from this work may be applicable to a range of problems.  The investigation starts by finding a suitable data structure to represent the information learnt. This is tested using supervised learning. Reinforcement learning is added and roughly tuned, and the supervised learning is then removed. A simple tabular representation is found satisfactory, and this avoids difficulties with more complex methods and allows the investigation to concentrate on the essentials of learning. Various reward sources are tested and a combination of three are found to produce the best performance. Exploration of the problem space is investigated. Results show exploration is essential but controlling how much is done is also important. It turns out the learning episodes need to be very long and because of this the task needs to be treated as continuous by using discounting to limit the size of the variables stored. Eligibility traces are used with success to make the learning more efficient. The tabular representation is made more compact by hashing and more accurate by using smaller buckets. This slows the learning but produces better driving. The improvement given by a rough form of generalisation indicates the replacement of the tabular method by a function approximator is warranted. These results show reinforcement learning can work within the Robot Automobile Racing Simulator, and lay the foundations for building a more efficient and competitive agent.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Artificial Intelligence</field><field name="subject">Reinforcement Learning</field><field name="subject">Q-learning</field><field name="subject">Multiple Reward Sources</field><field name="subject">Control of Exploration</field><field name="subject">Inherent Exploration</field><field name="subject">Tabular Representation</field><field name="subject">Machine Learning.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bounded Eigenvalues of Fully Clamped and Completely Free Rectangular Plates</field><field name="creator">Mochida, Yusuke</field><field name="description">Exact solution to the vibration of rectangular plates is available only for plates with two opposite edges subject to simply supported conditions. Otherwise, they are analysed by using approximate methods. There are several approximate methods to conduct a vibration analysis, such as the Rayleigh-Ritz method, the Finite Element Method, the Finite Difference Method, and the Superposition Method. The Rayleigh-Ritz method and the finite element method give upper bound results for the natural frequencies of plates. However, there is a disadvantage in using this method in that the error due to discretisation cannot be calculated easily. Therefore, it would be good to find a suitable method that gives lower bound results for the natural frequencies to complement the results from the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The superposition method is also a convenient and efficient method but it gives lower bound solution only in some cases. Whether it gives upper bound or lower bound results for the natural frequencies depends on the boundary conditions. It is also known that the finite difference method always gives lower bound results. This thesis presents bounded eigenvalues, which are dimensionless form of natural frequencies, calculated using the superposition method and the finite difference method. All computations were done using the MATLAB software package. The convergence tests show that the superposition method gives a lower bound for the eigenvalues of fully clamped plates, and an upper bound for the completely free plates. It is also shown that the finite difference method gives a lower bound for the eigenvalues of completely free plates. Finally, the upper bounds and lower bounds for the eigenvalues of fully clamped and completely free plates are given.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vibration</field><field name="subject">eigenvalue</field><field name="subject">natural frequencies</field><field name="subject">plate</field><field name="subject">superposition method</field><field name="subject">finite difference method</field><field name="subject">upper bound</field><field name="subject">lower bound</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Micro-mechanical predictive modelling as an aid to CAD based analysis of composite sporting equipment</field><field name="creator">Paul Ewart, D.</field><field name="description">The sport and leisure industry in New Zealand (NZ) has the potential to become a major user of composite materials. Given the size of NZ industry, design and manufacturing strategies based on virtual engineering should be developed to suit NZ requirements. Virtual methods use computer aided engineering capabilities to find faults, explore alternatives and optimise product performance before detailed design or prototyping. When doing computer aided simulation the required mechanical properties of individual reinforcement and matrix components are well documented. However, the mechanical properties of composite materials are not as simple to obtain. Micro-mechanical modelling could therefore be used to aid the design and development of composite equipment, where mechanical properties are unknown. In this study, solids modelling was used to produce an analog model of a composite, and it was found that it lead to reductions in file size and simulation time. Representing a composite with an analog model implies that the behavioural characteristics are modelled, but not the physical characteristics of the individual components. Three micro-mechanical models were developed to predict the flexural modulus of composite materials, based on perfect, partial and no adhesion. It was found that the partial adhesion model was both practical and consistently accurate. The partial adhesion model accounted for adhesion between components by considering an 'effective shear value' at the interface. Validation of the models was done by flexural testing injection moulded samples of glass, wood and carbon fibre reinforced polyethylene. It was shown that the adhesion coefficient range was 0.1 for carbon fibre, 0.5 for glass fibre and 0.9 for the wood fibre composites. It was concluded that the adhesion coefficient is crucial and it is recommended that further work is done to validate effective shear values by empirical means. The predicted flexural modulus values were used to enable finite element simulation of modelled analog beams as well as commercial kayak paddles. It was determined that accurate simulation is possible for composite equipment using the partial adhesion model.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CAD</field><field name="subject">flexural modulus</field><field name="subject">FEA</field><field name="subject">material design</field><field name="subject">mechanical properties</field><field name="subject">micromechanical</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression of Mitochondrial Stress Protein (Cpn60) in in vitro Cultured Neonatal Porcine Islet Cells</field><field name="creator">Munif, Farina</field><field name="description">Xenotransplantation of neonatal porcine islets have been demonstrated to be a viable alternative to exogenous insulin therapy for diabetes mellitus. The use of liberase has gained much success in islet isolation but factors such as batch-to-batch variation and deterioration of a batch with storage time have hampered the quality and reproducibility of tissue dissociation. Islet culture aims to optimise islet survival and insulin release in response to glucose challenge. However, it is difficult to recover and preserve islets in vitro.  Mitochondria play a key role in the secretion of insulin from pancreatic   islet cells in response to glucose stimulation. Mitochondrial dysfunction results in the induction (at mRNA and protein levels) of a molecular stress protein/heat chock protein called Cpn60. Since mitochondrial impairment will have a significant effect on the ability of in vitro cultured islet cells to function properly (i.e. release insulin in response to glucose stimulation), the expression of Cpn60 was investigated as a function of exposing neonatal porcine islet cells to various growth conditions.  The best choice of media to culture neonatal porcine islet cells was found to be not heated activated serum which showed the least levels of Cpn60 expression at mRNA levels suggesting that the cells had low levels of mitochondrial stress. Neonatal porcine islet cells would be best digested in cells digested with new liberase (QC 1050) while in 2% not heat inactivated porcine serum (NPS) as this gave the lowest levels of Cpn60 expression suggesting low levels of mitochondrial stress.  Although expression of Cpn60 at mRNA levels seems to be modulated during the growth of the porcine islet cells in media supplemented with different serum, heat treatment of serum and liberase content, no firm conclusion can be made with regard to the effect of the different treatments on mitochondrial health status until the porcine Cpn60 protein can be unequivocally identified.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mitochondria</field><field name="subject">Cpn60</field><field name="subject">Diabetes Mellitus</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A New Technique for Measuring Runup Variation Using Sub-Aerial Video Imagery</field><field name="creator">Salmon, Summer Anne</field><field name="description">Video monitoring of beaches is becoming the preferred method for observing changes to nearshore morphology. Consequently this work investigates a new technique for predicting the probability of inundation that is based on measuring runup variation using video. Runup is defined as the water-level elevation maxima on the foreshore relative to the still water level and the waterline is defined as the position where the MWL intersects the beach face. Tairua, and Pauanui Beaches, on the north east coast of the North Island of New Zealand, were used as the field site in this study and represent two very different beaches with the same incoming wave and meteorological conditions. Tairua is most frequently in an intermediate beach state, whereas Pauanui is usually flatter in nature.  In order to rectify runup observations, an estimate of the runup elevation was needed (Z). This was estimated by measuring the variation of the waterline over a tidal cycle from time-averaged video images during a storm event and provided beach morphology statistics (i.e. beach slope (&#945;) and beach intercept (b)) used in the rectification process where Z=aX+b. The maximum swash excursions were digitized from time-stacks, and rectified to provide run-up timeseries with duration 20 minutes. Field calibrations revealed a videoed waterline that was seaward of the surveyed waterline. Quantification of this error gave a vertical offset of 0.33m at Tairua and 0.25m at Pauanui. At Tairua, incident wave energy was dominant in the swash zone, and the runup distributions followed a Rayleigh distribution. At Pauanui, the flatter beach, the runup distributions were approximately bimodal due to the dominance of infragravity energy in the swash signal. The slope of the beach was a major control on the runup elevation; runup at Pauanui was directly affected by the deepwater wave height and the tide, while at Tairua there was no correlation. Overall, the results of the study indicate realistic runup measurements, over a wide range of time scales and, importantly, during storm events. However, comparisons of videoed runup and empirical runup formulae revealed larger deviations as the beach steepness increased. Furthur tests need to be carried out to see if this is a limitation of this technique, used to measure runup. The runup statistics are consistently higher at Tairua and suggests that swash runs up higher on steeper beaches. However, because of the characteristics of flatter beaches (such as high water tables and low drainage efficiencies) the impact of extreme runup elevations on such beaches are more critical in regards to erosion and/ or inundation.  The coastal environment is of great importance to M&#257;ori. Damage to the coast and coastal waahi tapu (places of spiritual importance) caused by erosion and inundation, adversely affects the spiritual and cultural well-being of M&#257;ori. For this reason, a chapter was dedicated to investigating the practices used by M&#257;ori to protect and preserve the coasts in accordance with tikanga M&#257;ori (M&#257;ori protocols). Mimicking nature was and still is a practice used by M&#257;ori to restore the beaches after erosive events, and includes replanting native dune plants and using natural materials on the beaches to stabilize the dunes. Tapu and rahui (the power and influence of the gods) were imposed on communities to prohibit and prevent people from free access to either food resources or to a particular place, in order to protect people and/ or resources. Interpretations of M&#257;ori oral histories provide insights into past local hazards and inform about the safety and viability of certain activities within an area. Environmental indicators were used to identify and forecast extreme weather conditions locally.  M&#257;ori knowledge of past hazards, and the coastal environment as a whole, is a valuable resource and provides a unique source of expertise that can contribute to current coastal hazards management plans in New Zealand and provide insights about the areas that may again be impacted by natural hazards.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wave Runup</field><field name="subject">Waterline determination</field><field name="subject">Swash maxima</field><field name="subject">Probability of Inundation</field><field name="subject">inundation</field><field name="subject">erosion</field><field name="subject">timestacks</field><field name="subject">infragravity wave energy</field><field name="subject">extreme runup elevation</field><field name="subject">Coastal Management and Maori</field><field name="subject">tikanga Maori</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Status and Trends Associated with Indigenous Communities Inland Water and the Development of Relevant International Law</field><field name="creator">Petersson, Jess</field><field name="description">This thesis is written at a time when the world faces many challenges. Gross violation of human rights persists, discrimination against and alienation of marginalized groups continues, the gulf between rich and poor yawns ever wider, and the rapid degradation of the environment continues to gain momentum. One area upon which environmental degradation impacts most crucially is water. In terms of vulnerability and scarcity as a commodity, water has come to be called by some 'the new oil'. Already, water has influenced political strategies and been the cause of wars. The aim of this thesis has been, firstly, to identify the status and trends in inland water ecosystems and their immediate dependents, with particular reference to indigenous communities living close to the water source, and hence more directly affected. If the destruction of inland water ecosystems is allowed to continue unchecked, it will inevitably have disastrous universal consequences. The thesis also discusses the protection of indigenous knowledge and innovations, provided by intellectual property and other instruments, and attempts to analyse developments in international law, which have relevance for indigenous peoples in connection with the conservation, management and sustainable use of inland water systems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">inland water ecosystems</field><field name="subject">international law</field><field name="subject">indigenous communities</field><field name="subject">indigenous knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Keeping Chooks at Home in the Waikato:  Exploring Postcolonial, Feminist and  Kaupapa M ori Perspectives</field><field name="creator">Burnett, Zavier</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the narratives of eight M ori chook keepers from the Waikato rohe, Aotearoa.

By listening to these stories, kaupapa including race, class and ethnicity emerge that affect the participants' everyday lives as chook keepers. The participants view chooks in a variety of ways. First, as a means of food production. By integrating chooks into their communities, the participants are able to provide a nutritious and low-cost kai source for themselves and their wh nau.

This is because such responses would ensure a 'best practice' approach to child abuse prevention.  This 'best-practice' approach is one where child abuse prevention measures are community-driven, child-centred, multi-disciplinary and inter-sectoral. Section 1 of this thesis will provide a background on the different types of child abuse, why child abuse occurs and what the consequences of child abuse are.  This section will also cover some current statistics on the incidences of child abuse in New Zealand.  Additionally, there is a discussion on how child abuse is increasingly being minimised within a family violence paradigm - even though family violence is only one form of child abuse.  New Zealand does not have a good track record when it comes to its rates of child abuse. Section 1 is intended to give the reader a very clear picture of how children in New Zealand are not currently being protected adequately enough from child abuse.  This protection should be coming from the adults in their lives, in their community and in their nation.  Section 2 of this thesis outlines an ecological framework for child abuse prevention.  More specifically the way in which such an ecological model is operating presently in New Zealand, at particularly an exosystem (community) and macrosystem (national) level.  The second part of this section discusses factors which will ensure the 'success' of an ecological framework for child abuse prevention.  By 'success' the author is referring to a framework in which the primary outcome is the prevalence of child abuse in New Zealand is reducing.  Section 3 of this thesis will contain the substantive arguments of this paper.  New Zealand does currently have in place legislative and policy responses to child abuse prevention.  However, the author maintains these responses to date have not been sufficient because New Zealand's rates of child abuse continue to escalate.  This section consists of 19 recommendations of legislative and policy responses that could be implemented at a macrosystem/national level.  At the conclusion of the recommendations contained in this thesis, it becomes clear that the government does need to respond urgently to New Zealand's growing child abuse rates.  New Zealand can no longer afford to have a reactive, ad-hoc approach to child abuse.  Nor can the response at a macro level continue to be one of rhetoric where there is more talk on child abuse prevention than there is on activating, monitoring and funding practical solutions.  It is the author's contention that if the government considered the interests and welfare of children as paramount in legislative and policy decisions that relate to children, then this will send a strong and clear signal to the adults in childrens' lives that children are not to be abused.  Instead, children are to be nurtured, respected and cherished in every way.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Child Abuse NZ</field><field name="subject">Legislative Policy Responses</field><field name="subject">Ecological Framework</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practice Makes the Difference: The Effect of Rate-Building and Rate-Controlled Practice on Retention</field><field name="creator">McGregor, Susan Jennifer</field><field name="description">Six home-schooled students and one adult participant each initially practiced to accuracy two decks of five previously unknown multiplication facts. The decks were yoked for practice and reinforcement. Once accurate performance was achieved, overpractice was undertaken using custom computer software that allowed either fast (free-operant) or rate controlled responding. Rate-building practice, to an established fluency performance standard, was used with one deck while practice with the other deck was rate-controlled.  The number of times a fact was practiced was the same for both methods. Response rate and accuracy was assessed after training to accuracy, at the end of overpractice and after 4  and 8-weeks of no practice. The assessment at the end of rate-building confirmed that rate building resulted in fast and accurate responding. It also confirmed that, for the rate controlled facts, response rates did not meet the fluency performance standard. However, the 4- and 8-week retention assessments showed no consistent differences in accuracy or response rate between the rate-controlled and rate built decks. After 8 weeks without practice, performance on the rate-built deck was not significantly different to that prior to rate building. These results suggest that practice to fluency does not lead to superior retention when compared to the same amount of rate-controlled practice. The results also indicate that when a skill is practiced to fluency, a period without practice leads to deterioration, to pre-rate-building levels, of accuracy and response rate. This study highlights the need for research examining the role of maintenance in the effectiveness of fluency based learning like Precision Teaching.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pecision Teaching</field><field name="subject">Behavioural Teaching Methods</field><field name="subject">Behavioral Teaching Methods</field><field name="subject">Fluency Training</field><field name="subject">Retention</field><field name="subject">Rate Building.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Restoring giant kokopu (Galaxias argenteus) populations in Hamilton's urban streams</field><field name="creator">Aldridge, Brenda Michelle Te Aroha</field><field name="description">In this study, options for restoring fish populations in Hamilton City (37.47'S, 175.19'E) were explored.  Habitat and fish populations in Hamilton urban streams were manipulated using a two-fold experimental design.  Firstly, habitat was enhanced in ten urban streams with three continuous treatments in a 60-m reach at each site (20 m with 10 ponga logs, 20 m with 20 hollow clay pipes, and 20 m with no added structure).  Secondly, juvenile farm-reared giant kokopu (Galaxias argenteus), were stocked into five of the enhanced stream sections.  Giant kokopu are threatened and occur naturally in Hamilton urban streams in sparse populations.  The abundance of wild fish was monitored before and after enhancement and fish release from November 2006 to November 2007.  Stocked fish were monitored for eight months, from April to November 2007.  Over this time electric fishing was conducted three times, trap nets (Gee minnow and fyke nets) were set monthly and spotlighting was conducted monthly at three release sites where water clarity allowed. Anticipated outcomes of this research were; to determine whether giant kokopu abundance in Hamilton urban streams is limited by recruitment or by habitat, and to assist with the development of methods to restore fish populations in Hamilton City urban streams.  Logs used as enhancement structures in Hamilton urban streams provided more stable habitat for fish and created more suitable microhabitat than pipe structures.  Pipes moved considerably during high flows, and their instability made them less effective at providing habitat.  Within the study sites there appeared to be complex interactions with turbidity, stream width and depth, which complicated the effect of the habitat structures.  The limited replication and variability among sites contributed to statistically insignificant results using analysis of variance. Retention and recapture rates of stocked juvenile giant kokopu were greatest at Site M11, where the stream was narrow, shallow, clear and had lower numbers and biomass of shortfin eels, compared to other survey sites.  Marked and released giant kokopu were retained in the release reaches at four of the five sites, for a minimum of four months, and exhibited substantial growth.  Daily growth of juvenile giant kokopu ranged from 0.19 to 0.33 mm day-1 and from 0.03 to 0.11 g day-1, exhibiting substantial growth over winter.  Giant kokopu appeared to have a slight bias to the log section of enhanced habitat, but habitat selection appeared to be overwhelmingly controlled by initial habitat selection.  The stocking of farm-reared fish into urban streams was largely successful, but the success of the habitat enhancement was variable and further work is required to determine better techniques for habitat enhancement in these urban environments.  It is concluded that releasing farm-reared giant kokopu can be used to restore populations especially where recruitment limitations control fish abundance and diversity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Giant kokopu</field><field name="subject">Hamilton</field><field name="subject">urban</field><field name="subject">stream</field><field name="subject">Galaxias</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a Method of Analysis by High Performance Liquid Chromatography for Products of the Nitric Acid Oxidation of D-Glucose</field><field name="creator">Mills, Heidi Clare Maria</field><field name="description">This thesis explored the development of a faster and more efficient means of qualitative and quantitative analysis of the products of the nitric acid oxidation of D-glucose and other simple sugars, for the Shafizadeh Rocky Mountain Center for Wood and Carbohydrate Chemistry.  During the research, analysis was carried out based on previous work completed in a similar area using two Aminex HPX-87H+ cation-exchange columns at different temperatures, and plumbed in series.  Standards were filtered and injected on to the columns, then eluted with 5 mM sulfuric acid.  A total run time of 33 minutes enabled the elution of all products and by-products of the reaction.  Retention times of standards and the use of spiking helped specify and quantify unknowns in samples from a series of oxidation reactions involving D-glucose and other aldoses.  The PrevailTM Organic acid (OA) column was said to provide 'unsurpassed resolution of organic acids'.  It was therefore investigated, and a method was developed and refined in order to optimise conditions enabling the column's use for the required analyses.  The optimised parameters were established as: ambient temperature with an eluent of 10 mM KH2PO4 adjusted to a pH of 2.1 with phosphoric acid.  The sample size was 5 uL with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min, giving a total run time of approximately 13 minutes.  The Aminex HPX-87H+ column method and the PrevailTM OA method were compared to determine the superior method for the analyses intended.  While some improvements were made for detection in the PrevailTM OA method, results were not satisfactory.  This was due in part to limits imposed on the PrevailTM OA column method, which prevented the use of gradient elution.  The Aminex HPX-87H+ column method outlined herein provides superior resolution for the nitric acid oxidation of D-glucose to D-glucaric acid, and in conclusion it is suggested that the Aminex HPX-87H+ column method be used.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aminex HPX-87H</field><field name="subject">Prevail OA</field><field name="subject">chromatography</field><field name="subject">HPLC</field><field name="subject">nitric acid oxidation</field><field name="subject">D-glucose</field><field name="subject">organic acids</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ability of nitrification inhibitors to decrease denitrification rates in dairy farm soils</field><field name="creator">Watkins, Natalie Lisa</field><field name="description">Increasing pressure is being placed on the dairy industry to reduce nitrogen losses from soil.  Nitrification inhibitors are a management strategy that could be implemented on dairy farms to help reduce losses of nitrogen.  Nitrification inhibitors work by temporarily inhibiting the microbial conversion of soil ammonium to nitrate.  Past trials have indicated that nitrification inhibitors can increase grass production and decrease nitrate leaching; however, little is known about the long-term effects on other soil nitrogen processes such as denitrification.  Denitrification rates in soils can be limited by the availability of substrate (carbon and nitrate) and by insufficient anaerobic microsites. The objective of this thesis was to establish whether the nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide (DCD), could decrease denitrification rates in dairy farm soils by limiting nitrate availability.  A field trial was established at Dexcel's research farm near Hamilton, New Zealand on a Typic Orthic Allophanic Soil. Twenty replicated field plots were established in a paddock, ten plots acted as controls and ten plots had DCD applied to the soil once a month at a rate of 30 kg ha-1 yr-1.  Denitrification rates were measured using the acetylene inhibition technique on intact soil cores.  Ammonium and nitrate concentration, soil carbon availability, denitrifying enzyme activity and soil pH were measured from soil samples collected monthly.  Two further field experiments and one laboratory experiment were undertaken.  The distribution of denitrifying enzyme activity with soil depth was measured to ensure that the depth to which denitrification was sampled (15 cm) in the field experiment was sufficient.  DCD degradation in the field during 20 days was measured to establish how long the effects of DCD might last.  A laboratory study investigated whether DCD would decrease denitrifying enzyme activity in soil, when soil conditions were optimized for denitrification. More than 80% of the denitrifying enzyme activity occurred in the top 15 cm of the soil profile, indicating that the depth to which samples were collected was sufficient.  There was no significant decrease in denitrification rates in the field experiment when DCD was added.  Nitrification was partially inhibited as shown by a significant increase in soil ammonium (+14%) and a significant decline in soil nitrate (-17%) in the DCD-amended soils compared to the control soils.  However, the decline in soil nitrate was not great enough for nitrate to limit denitrification.  Nitrate concentrations were consistently greater than 5 mg NO3- kg-1 soil (the proposed threshold for declines in denitrification).  The laboratory study supported the field study with DCD having no effect on denitrifying enzyme activity and nitrate concentrations remaining above 5 mg NO3- kg-1 soil.  So while DCD reduced nitrification rates and the formation of nitrate, denitrification rates were not limited by nitrate availability.  DCD was completely degraded in the soil 19 days after DCD application, with a half-life of 2.9 days, which may be a reason for the minor inhibition of nitrification.  Denitrifying enzyme activity, carbon availability and soil pH were all unaffected by the application of DCD.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nitrification inhibitors</field><field name="subject">DCD</field><field name="subject">denitrification rates</field><field name="subject">dairy farm soils</field><field name="subject">nitrification</field><field name="subject">degradation of DCD</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young mothers speak out: Young P&#257;keh&#257; women's experiences of motherhood.</field><field name="creator">Banks, Hannah</field><field name="description">Early motherhood is a much debated and highly contentious topic. This research aimed to explore young P&#257;keh&#257; women's experiences of motherhood using a feminist qualitative framework. Twelve women, six current young mothers and six former young mothers, were interviewed via focus groups and individual interviews. The analysis revealed that P&#257;keh&#257; culture constructs young mothers as problematic because they challenge the 'traditional' family dominant in P&#257;keh&#257; culture. By having children prior to, rather than after, workforce participation and achieving economic independence, young mothers challenge the prescribed life trajectory for P&#257;keh&#257; women. The women in this study discussed both the positive aspects and the challenges they faced as young mothers. In contrast to common public perceptions and media representations of early motherhood as negative, motherhood positively transformed the women's lives. This was discussed in terms of ceasing destructive activities and gaining motivation to return to education. The young mothers in this study had flexible parenting styles, which allowed them freedom from P&#257;keh&#257; cultural pressure to 'do motherhood' in a particular way. As young mothers, the women had high energy levels and anticipated early future freedom from childcare duties to pursue their dreams. Challenges discussed by the women included incorporating unanticipated early motherhood into long-held life goals, feeling exhausted, having a lack of time for themselves and having too little support. Financial hardship, poverty, judgment and stigma surfaced as major challenges which affected all areas of the women's lives. However, the women also resisted this discrimination by using a range of strategies, which positions them as women with agency, challenging their representation within literature as passive victims. Young women will not use services where they perceive they will be judged for being who they are. As levels of support appear to determine how young women experience motherhood, services have a vital role to play in supporting young mothers. The findings of this study highlighted the complex and contradictory nature of the young mothers' stories, presenting a challenge to simple and stereotypical negative discourses of early motherhood.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Young mothers</field><field name="subject">P&#257;keh&#257; culture</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collaboration in family violence intervention: A process evaluation of the hamilton Family Safety Team</field><field name="creator">Gregg, Lisa</field><field name="description">The Family Safety Team (FST) is a collaborative intervention developed to address family violence in New Zealand. Interagency collaborations are effective at addressing the social supports for battery, improving the systems and responses of agencies that address battery, and improving cohesion and consistency across agencies. The FST has a particular focus on justice system agencies. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the Hamilton FST. The research was conducted using in-depth interviews with FST members and others directly involved with the project, archival research using police family violence files, observation of FST meetings, and a focus group with battered women. The evaluation was constructed around four aims: to identify any barriers to establishing the FST, to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the Hamilton FST, to determine the adequacy of the FST structure, and to assess the extent to which the FST has improved the ability of agencies to enhance the safety and autonomy of battered women and hold offenders accountable. An overall finding of this evaluation was that people are feeling very positive about the Hamilton FST. The evaluation found that the FST has increased contact and communication between community and government agencies, and there was improvement in each agency's awareness of the policies, processes and protocols of other agencies in the FST. The evaluation found some limitations in the amount of monitoring and measurable outcomes from the FST, but this was understandable considering the infancy of the project and the time taken for members to understand their roles and the function of the FST. However, there were some positive developments in police responsiveness: an improved police attitude towards family violence cases, and an increase in cases coded as family violence. An important finding of this evaluation was that the Hamilton FST is functioning as a genuine collaboration. This seemed to be due to: mutual respect and an equal distribution of power among FST members, trusted working relationships, recognising each member for their area of expertise, and the role of the coordinator. There are, however, some limitations of the FST model that FST members need to acknowledge.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">collaboration</field><field name="subject">interagency</field><field name="subject">family violence</field><field name="subject">battery</field><field name="subject">coordination</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A tephra-dated record of palaeoenvironmental change since ~ 5,500 years ago from Lake Rotorua, North Island, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pickett, Rachel Cara</field><field name="description">A palaeolimnological study was carried out on a high-resolution, 7.62 m-long core (RU188-07) from northern Lake Rotorua, North Island. The core consists predominantly of olive diatomaceous ooze, laminated in places, and contains five tephras including Tarawera (1886 A.D.), Kaharoa (c. 1314 A.D.), Taupo (c. 233 A.D.) and Whakatane (c. 5500 cal. years B.P.).  The core terminated in Whakatane Tephra giving the sediment a maximum age of 5530   60 cal. years B.P.  An age model for the sediment was developed using tephrochronology.  Radiocarbon dates obtained on the sediment returned ages too old because of contamination by old CO2 or CH4, or both.  Investigations carried out on the core included spectrophotometric, sedimentological and geochemical analyses, and diatom identifications, which provided a number of proxies from which inferences were made about lake history, catchment development, and palaeoclimate since c. 5500 cal. years B.P.  The laminations, evident only in the upper, post-Kaharoa Tephra part of the record, comprise alternations of thin, dark, detrital deposits and pale, relatively fine-grained diatom assemblages.  Sediment geochemistry indicates that the Rotorua catchment has undergone several changes since c. 5500 cal. years B.P., alternating between periods of variable and stable environmental conditions.  Following the Whakatane and Waimihia eruptions and up to approximately 3000 cal. years B.P., the catchment surrounding Lake Rotorua was rather unstable.  Fluctuations in many of the proxies during this period are likely to be associated with a variable climate with periods of storminess, coinciding with the establishment of ENSO conditions in New Zealand.  A notable feature of the record is two phases of stability, the first following the Taupo eruption (from c. 1700 cal. years B.P. to c. 630 cal. years B.P.) and the second from c. 580 cal. years B.P. to c. 300 cal. years B.P.  The latest, most significant event in the catchment history of Lake Rotorua was the settlement by Polynesians.  M.S. McGlone implied from pollen profiles (from Holden's Bay) that initial settlement took place around the time of the Kaharoa eruption (c. 630 cal years B.P.; c. 1314 A.D.), but the sediment chemistry and erosion profiles obtained here, from the northern part of Lake Rotorua, indicate that although there may have been some early clearing in the northern catchment for tracks or buildings, large-scale clearing in the area probably did not occur until considerably later, c. 300 cal. years B.P.  Also contained within the sediments are three layers of reworked tephric material that probably originate from the transfer of coarse grained tephra from shallow to deeper water during large storms at c. 1300 cal. years B.P, c. 520 cal. years B.P, and c. 220 cal. years B.P.  Each event coincides with storm events inferred from records from Lake Tutira in eastern North Island.  Because of Lake Rotorua's inland position, these inferred storm events probably represent only the largest cyclonic events (e.g. ex-tropical cyclones).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lake Rotorua</field><field name="subject">sediment geochemistry</field><field name="subject">tephrochronology</field><field name="subject">palaeolimnology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kapa Haka Whakataetae Kua tini haere te kanohi o te mahi kapa haka i te ao hurihuri nei.</field><field name="creator">Rollo, Te Manaaroha Pirihira</field><field name="description">KO TE ARIA   Tihei Haka!

Surveys indicate that a considerable proportion of the population fail to engage in even modest amounts. As well as conferring health benefits, leading an active life can help to build social capital, achieve manual tasks, enhance enjoyment, and reduce traffic congestion and pollution. The research of physical activity in New Zealand is, therefore, important. Many factors influence physical activity behaviour, but traditionally there has been a focus on individual-level behaviour-change approaches. In recent years research has started to focus more on characteristics of physical and social environments, such as provision of cycle paths and development of community social cohesion. Concerned by what I observed to be an over-emphasis by New Zealand agencies on encouraging individual behaviour change, I set out to examine the factors that contributed to the shaping of built and social environments, and their effects on population physical activity. Identifying a gap in the research, I examined these factors via a case study of the Hamilton City Council (HCC). My study employed Foucauldian 'tools' to examine selected HCC documents and interview transcripts with a view to identifying the discourses underpinning local government action with regard to built and social environments and physical activity. In this process I interviewed seven HCC staff members from six relevant departments, including Parks and Gardens, Community Development, and Roading and Transportation. Data was gathered from the staff members using semi-structured interviews, based on pre-prepared guidelines, developed following a review of relevant literature. Relevant HCC strategy and planning documents were selected only after interviews were completed and included their urban design, transportation, creativity and identity and social well-being strategies. I adopted a Foucauldian perspective to analyse the data because I wanted to examine the phenomena of increased physical inactivity by questioning particular 'ways of knowing' and 'truths'. Such an examination, at the level of local government, could help reveal why some cities are more conducive to active living than others. This theoretical approach helped reveal a number of underpinning discourses, including discourses of economic rationality; the council as nurturer; safety and surveillance; participative government; and work efficiency. Key discourses of economic rationality and participative government were pervasive in both the interviews and documents, highlighting the degree to which economic considerations and consultative practices dominate local government actions. My four main findings were that HCC is shaped by and shapes certain discourses; HCC activities are contingent upon many factors outside their control; the creation of supportive environments for active living is a complex task; and, that dominating discourses can silence or obscure other equally valid discourses. These findings gave rise to discursive effects. Firstly, local authority planning, strategizing and action can promote population behaviour control by facilitating resident self-regulation. Secondly, factors outside the control of local authorities can impact on their ability to realise active living goals. Lastly, valid but silenced 'ways of knowing' about physical activity, health, and governance can constrain population physical activity participation. I found that HCC actions were reflective of the discourses identified, illustrating wider societal concerns regarding physical inactivity, obesity, citizenship, economic success, 'democratic' practices, and efficiency. This study contributes to population physical activity research by recognising the value of environmental approaches, but underscoring the need to consider the sources, mechanisms of maintenance, and effects of discourses circulating in local government using appropriate theoretical approaches.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">local government</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="subject">urban design</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of a Lightweight Electric Vehicle Chassis and Investigation into the Suitability of TiAl for Automotive Applications</field><field name="creator">Lovatt, Carl Ryan</field><field name="description">A lightweight chassis for a battery electric vehicle being developed at the University of Waikato was required.

The chassis weighs a little over a third the mass of a mass production car chassis. The car has been driven over 1800km with only one minor problem, indicating the chassis is reliable and well suited to its purpose. Titanium aluminide properties were researched to identify where titanium aluminides could be used in an automobile. Titanium aluminides have a specific strength and stiffness near to steel yet only half the density making it an ideal replacement for steel components.

The broad objective is to advance the understanding of MS processes through constructing consistent patterns in decision-making and action-taking relating to the manufacturing structure and infrastructure of the organisations studied.  Using a combined "Grounded Theory - Case Study" approach, nine organisations within the metal products, machinery and equipment manufacturing sectors in Australia were studied, in order to address the following research questions:  How are competitive priorities arrived at and translated into decisions and actions regarding the manufacturing structure and infrastructure? What are the consistent patterns of manufacturing strategy formation within specific organisational contexts and why those patterns exist that way?   Qualitative data gathered through interviews conducted with the management staff - based on the sequences of events, actions and decisions, as well as other broader aspects of MS - were analysed by means of progressive coding. The themes, relationships and conceptual schemas emerged through the coding process are presented using narratives and graphical displays. The overall findings are presented in aggregate terms using a conceptual model, supplemented by several theoretical propositions. Deeper structures in MS processes represent linear and parallel, converging and diverging and sequential and iterative progression of strategic initiatives across four major phases identified as initiation, progression, commitment and realisation. The multiple modes of initiation, alternative paths of consolidation and differing forms of commitment and realisation are explained by the nature of strategic initiatives, the causal links between the modes themselves and the influence of certain organisational contextual factors.  When enfolded in extant literature, these findings make two major contributions. First, apart from corroborating the complex and dynamic nature of MS formation in practice, they explicate the underlying patterns and alternative forms of MS formation. Second, they demonstrate some causal relationships between alternative forms of MS formation and certain contextual factors. These insights would inform future research, leading towards the development of a plausible mid-range theory of MS processes. They would also help practitioners to better understand the dynamics of MS formation and to nurture appropriate forms of MS formation within specific organisational settings.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Operations management and strategy</field><field name="subject">Strategy process</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finding voice, being heard and living in the tension : novice nurse academics critical engagement with a problem orientated curriculum in the academic and practice setting</field><field name="creator">Davis, Kierrynn</field><field name="description">This thesis is an account of the lived experience of doing research in the critical paradigm in the context of the discipline of social ecology. It is a story with actors, a plot, and actions over time. The Worldview of social ecology has embedded within its epistemology the scope for the creative act of narrative, therefore this thesis is a critical conversation told in four voices. The research was embedded in critical social science methodology and method, and attempted to understand and transform the problematics concerning the social relations, practice, language and discourse which were uncovered when five novice nurse academics engaged in teaching a problem-orientated curriculum in the practice setting. It was a critical action research project based predominantly on the Kemmis and McTaggart Model (1988). The research also debated the nature of participative, collaborative action research undertaken in the context of gaining an educational qualification. Relevant to this point, two other contexts of the research were uncovered. The lived experience of ?doing? critical action research with colleagues and friends, in the context of gaining an educational qualification revealed both the praxis nature of ethical research and the reclaiming of an authoritative women?s voice in the academy. The ethical nature of research in critical social science, and the nature and role of human identity was explored in an effort to conceptualise both a methodology and a self identity which was embedded in a context of mutual growth. This growth was similar to Bookchin?s (1990) transitory states of ?becoming? what we wished to become in the academy. It was what is known in organisations as professional development. The author named this becoming, ?Finding a Women?s Voice and Being Heard?. Although ?finding voice? is situated in the personal, ?being heard? involves the ?not I? together with structural features of institutions. As a collaborative group, the participants actioned strategies in an attempt to deal with the structural limitations to our ?becoming?. These strategies, together with the consciousness raising nature of this particular action research project, enabled participants to speak of their own empowerment within an academic context in which they were often rendered powerless.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nurse academics</field><field name="subject">feminist theory</field><field name="subject">nursing schools</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">social ecology</field><field name="subject">ontology</field><field name="subject">ecofeminism</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">women?s voice</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Long-term multiple stressors, coping and academic performance</field><field name="creator">Vivekananda, Savithri</field><field name="description">This research comprised of three studies designed to investigate the coping strategies utilised by high and low performing university students with non-academic stressors. Coping research has frequently focused on single stressors providing a distorted picture of coping. Utilising a combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies, this research provides new insights into the dynamic and multi-dimensional nature of coping with long-term, multiple stressors. It extends our understanding of coping beyond traditionally individualistic conceptualisations where active coping is valued over prosocial relationship-focused coping. Conceptualisations of social support is broadened to view it in more complex interactional terms. In Study 1, 521 university students were surveyed using a standardised coping inventory, the Ways of Coping Checklist revised. Several demographic groups were identified as at academic risk. Having good health, along with the high use Social Support and Problem Solving and the low use of Self Blame strategies all predicted high GPA. Study 2 involved a content analysis of 179 Exclusion Appeal letters submitted by excluded students. When confronted with multiple stressors, poor performing students compartmentalised or amplified multiple stressors which resulted in patterns of reactive problem-focused or emotion-focused coping. Passive and uni-directional approaches to social support resulted in the depletion of such resources. Study 3 investigated adaptive coping patterns using an open-ended questionnaire and a semi-structured interview with twenty high performing students. High performers viewed multiple stressors as inter-related, which is termed cross situational appraisal and displayed a versatile coping pattern across stressors termed cross situational versatility. Proactive and prosocial coping are critical for the acquisition and maintenance of social support over a long-term period. Implications of these research findings for Student Services staff are discussed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">student services</field><field name="subject">high performers</field><field name="subject">stressors</field><field name="subject">emotion-focused coping</field><field name="subject">social support</field><field name="subject">self blame</field><field name="subject">university</field><field name="subject">non-academic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silenced voices of Mexican culture : identity, resistance and creativity in the interethnic dialogue</field><field name="creator">Coronado Suza&#769;n, Gabriela</field><field name="description">Interethnic communication is the focus of this thesis, as the basis for understanding Mexican culture and identity as a dynamic and complex process, which acts, from the past and in the present, to create what Mexicans are and will be.By exploring different instances where interethnic communication occurs and produces various representations of culture, this work shows the complexities of interethnic exchanges at different levels of Mexican society (in the community or in the nation) and at different moments of its history (from the conquest to the present).This complex picture is constructed using an interdisciplinary framework that includes radical ethnography, social semiotics and new social history; all of them oriented to the understanding of culture as a meaningful way to analyse society in the context of its cultural, economic and political life.Through different interethnic activities (political meetings, cultural representations, religious practices, economic activities, institutional projects, social movements) this research explores what Indian creativity can offer to construct a society that is simultaneously ancient and new, united and diverse, Indian and Mexican, and, more than ever, just and inclusive of all sectors that form Mexican society</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ethnic relations</field><field name="subject">Mexico</field><field name="subject">social life and customs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/378</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cartographies of rural community nursing and primary health care: mapping the in-between spaces</field><field name="creator">Davis, Kierrynn</field><field name="description">This postmodern feminist ethnographies research aimed to explore the everyday meanings of primary health care (PHC) held by rural community nurses. Secondly, the research aimed to explore the everyday meanings of care held by the clients of the rural community nurses who participated in the study. The representation of this research is written in four voices which converse with each other to varying degrees in each chapter. This writing strategy is a deliberate one aimed at destabilising the usual approach to representation of research. It is also a strategy which seeks methodological coherence. The third aim therefore is to deliberately trouble the acceptable grounds concerning how nursing research is represented. The research utilised dialogical (conversational)and participant observation methods concerning the everyday meanings of nurses and their clients.The meanings I made of the information were created from a deconstruction of the texts. These texts included fieldnotes of participant observations and transcripts of conversations with nurses and their clients. The form of deconstruction utilised was informed from multiple sources and involved three levels of analysis. A realist interpretation was followed by an oppositional interpretation and then a reconstructive movement. The results revealed that rural community nurses practice is both spatio-temporally contextualised and metaphorically situated in an in-between space. This in-between space is situated between margin and the centre. Rural community nurses working on the margins traverse this space in order to overcome further marginalisation whilst working with Indigenous Australians and the aged. Moreover, the in-between space encompasses and creates opportunities to mutually exchange the gift of desire that being - empowering and compassionate relationships with clients and colleagues. Futhermore, whilst rural community nurses are strongly committed to the philosophy of PHC, their evryday working life is discursively constructed by powerful discourses which result in oppositional tensions. The tensions and the 'in-between' space allow the rhetoric of PHC to be resisted and reframed. Consequently, the oppositional constructs of their practice were displaced. Moreover, this necessitated the negotiation of space and place, and required the reconstruction of subjectivity, intersubjectivity and becoming</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous Australians</field><field name="subject">rural communities</field><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">primary health care</field><field name="subject">aged</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/470</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Divining woman : the waterpourer's lineage</field><field name="creator">Flower, Jane</field><field name="description">This thesis engages with the feminist argument that women need to create a culture of the female and rediscover female genealogy. The misogynistic, theological and philosophical narratives on Woman are deconstructed. Using the metaphor of divining as a tool for searching for a source the author seeks to discover the source of Woman, one not bound by male definition and control. In removing the stigma of Woman as 'misbegotten male' and cause of 'original sin' Woman's sexuality and spirituality are recognised. Female sex is acknowledged and the difference reframed so that male sex no longer holds the dominant position. Woman becomes Divine, and it is a divinity that signifies her earthly interactions in her spiritual, social and personal life. After the divining a female genealogy is created and the divine is drawn out in woman. The writing and analyses of Virginia Woolf and Luce Irigaray are drawn on to establish the basis of the research methodology. Creativity, myths, story, poetry, fiction and feminist analysis are used to find the woman hidden in traditional patriarchal rendering of history. This thesis is both a historical and autobiographical research taken within the context of the author's cultural influences. It is a transdisciplinary research within a set framework, concentrating on women's sexual and spiritual specificity. Greek and Celtic history, Wicca, Christianity and Buddhism are included, with an inclusive but not in-depth analysis of these traditions. The underlying theme of this thesis is women's disconnection from each other. In the author's personal story it concerns her mother, sister and herself. In the collective story it is about women's loss of their female genealogy and connection to their women's history.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">female genealogy</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">sexuality</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/618</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spirit of learning: an exploration into the role of personal/spiritual development in the learning, teaching process</field><field name="creator">Griggs, Dawn E.</field><field name="description">Spirit of Learning in a general sense is an exploration of the inextricable link between learning, individual personal development and potential. This thesis emphasises the personal/spiritual development of the educator, including the author, within an enhanced, holistic learning context, which is called 'integrated accelerative learning'. The inquiry examines the way individual educators and 'life-long learners' develop their inner selves, by exploring some of their relevant attitudes, values and significant life experiences. The accelerative learning approach is based on a philosophy which includes an expanded view and maximisation of human potential. It incorporates the knowledge of individual learning styles, 'multiple intelligences' and emphasises the development of effective life-long learning strategies. Throughout the thesis the use of the term 'spiritual development' is intended to be interchangeable with 'personal development' and is based on the author's view that the essential self is a spiritual being.An 'educator of integrated acclerative learning'is described as one who is aware of, and to some degree, consciously utilises elements of the paraconscious (beyond the usual conscious level), in order to enhance the teaching/learning process and promote personal development within the learner. The author's thesis is that educators need to examine the essence of themselves behind innovative methods used. The belief is that there is a need to nourish, sustain and grow in accordance with the positive and transformative nature of the philosophy espoused and the methods used. Within the area of personal/spiritual development, many themes have emerged, including the changing role and attitudes of the educator from teacher to facilitator. The theme of integration is a particularly strong one and includes the concept of congruency, encouraging the development of all aspects of ourselves and integrating one's personal and professional lives. In general,the writer has discovered that most of the smaller themes can be identified under three major umbrella themes. These are integration, awareness and human potential, the development and expansion of which can be seen as promoting a sense of interconnectedness and the development of spirituality in general</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="subject">educator</field><field name="subject">facilitator</field><field name="subject">personal development</field><field name="subject">human potential</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding deliberate self harm : an enquiry into attempted suicide</field><field name="creator">Wyder, Marianne</field><field name="description">This study focused on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of suicidal behaviour of 90 people who had come to the attention of the Accident and Emergency Department of Westmead Hospital, Sydney, N.S.W., after an attempt to harm themselves.

As evidence mounts of the destructive, pervasive and sometimes lethal impact of these phenomena within the education milieu, it has become apparent that an approach which compromises a pragmatic intervention informed by innovative theoretical perspectives is urgently required. The body of work presented in this portfolio attempts to address this need by presenting a comprehensive model for intervention in violence and bullying in schools. Based upon the findings of a survey of four Sydney metropolitan schools, and drawing upon extant theory and research, a number of important theoretical perspectives were identified. The proposal that violence may be resolved through education is explored and perceptions about contemporary influences, including the impact of exposure to media violence, are challenged. The conceptualisation of peer abuse as a legislated child protection issue is initiated and discussed. The necessity for the development of resiliency as an individual attribute for victims is examined and the function of peers as formal advocates for victims is proposed. In summary, this portfolio presents a body of scholarly, professional work focused on addressing the issues of violence and bullying in schools through new perspectives and a comprehensive model for intervention that can readily be implemented by educators</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bullying in schools</field><field name="subject">school violence</field><field name="subject">school discipline</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/755</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring childbearing women's perception of the role of a midwife</field><field name="creator">Boon, Leen Ooi</field><field name="description">In this study, the childbearing women's perception of the role of a midwife in Australia was explored using a descriptive study.

In deconstructing the debate, this thesis shows that addressing biology within sociology does not require an acceptance of determinism and that a plurality of possibilities still exists. It also reveals that human corporeality is viscerally susceptible to the environment and that separating human social life from its corporeality merely reiterates the Judeo-Christian theology that human life is divinely separate from its environment.

They must support their artistic personnel, who are typically driven by the quest for new, challenging and experimental works, while achieving the economic success necessary for the continued viability of their organisations. Failing to effectively manage this artistic-economic dichotomy can result in a conflict between artists and managers that threatens the long-term survival of these organisations. There is a clear need, therefore, for arts managers to foster an organisational climate that minimises conflict, while promoting organisational citizenship behaviours (OCBs) such as sportsmanship (a willingness to tolerate less than ideal circumstances without complaining) and courtesy (a willingness to show sensitivity towards others and actively avoid creating problems for co-workers). The main aim of the present study was to examine the extent to which factors such as organisational structure, organisational culture and employees&#146; motivational orientation influence people&#146;s perceptions of their job scope (as indicated by high levels of task variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy and feedback from the job), a construct which has been found to reduce organisational conflict and increase employees&#146; propensity to display OCBs. While these relationships have been suggested in previous research, they have not been tested in a performing arts industry context. The data analysed in the present study suggested an enjoyment motivational orientation, a challenge motivational orientation, an organic culture and formalisation positively influenced perceptions of job scope, which, in turn, positively influenced both OCBs (sportsmanship and courtesy). A challenge orientation also had a positive impact on sportsmanship, while sportsmanship positively and directly influenced courtesy. Centralisation was negatively related to perceived job scope and sportsmanship, although it had a positive impact on courtesy. Conflict was negatively influenced by formalisation and by an organic culture, but was positively influenced by a hierarchal culture.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conflict management -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Performing arts -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Organizational behavior -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Arts management</field><field name="subject">Citizenship behaviour</field><field name="subject">Conflict</field><field name="subject">Citizenship behavior</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0096</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photography and Reflection: A study exploring perceptions of first year nursing students towards older persons.</field><field name="creator">G.Brand@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This qualitative exploratory study sought to explore and analyse the perceptions of first year nursing students aged 18-25 years toward older persons in aged care facilities.  The expectations of first year nursing students in relation to performing nursing care on older persons was also examined. The students&#146; perceptions were explored using a photo-elicitation technique to evoke an emotive response. By challenging and confronting the participants with realistic photographs of nursing care, this technique encouraged the research participants to engage in anticipatory reflection prior to their first aged care clinical placement.   

Data were gathered through demographic questionnaires and semi-structured photo-elicitation interviews.  Findings were analysed using thematic analysis.  Themes included dissecting what it means to be a nurse, recognising dependence, and the re-visioning of therapeutic relationships including considering patient dignity and empathising with older persons.  A youthful reflection on the differences between young and old included participants&#146; fearing for themselves in future, and this was another identified theme.  The photo-elicitation technique challenged and confronted participants as they became aware of the responsibilities of performing nursing care and their belief that they lacked emotional preparedness.  Experiencing sensitivity and awkwardness to nakedness of older person&#146;s bodies was also highlighted by most of the participants&#146; responses. 

The findings suggest that it is essential in this time of demographic change and the growing ageing population that nursing education responds to the challenge of an evolving health care system by providing qualified, experienced aged care nurses who are familiar with the reality of older people. Therefore, first year nursing students&#146; transition to aged care nursing clinical placement and the adoption of positive attitudes is paramount. Despite a large number of research studies highlighting nursing students&#146; disinterest in caring for older persons, there have been few studies investigating educational interventions that could assist in overcoming this negative trend.  

The findings from this study have important implications for teaching strategies aimed at understanding undergraduate nursing students.  Using photography to elicit emotional responses can also assist with reflective practice, which can be useful to enhance self awareness and an aesthetic and personal knowing.   Encouraging anticipatory reflection can help socially prepare nursing students, increase their readiness for learning and foster more positive attitudes to caring for older people prior to the students&#146; initial aged care clinical placement.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Photography</field><field name="subject">reflection</field><field name="subject">photo-elicitation</field><field name="subject">perceptions</field><field name="subject">first year nursing students</field><field name="subject">older persons</field><field name="subject">nursing education</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090702.110629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors that influence participation in self-management of wound care in three Indigenous communities in Western Australia: Clients' perspectives.</field><field name="creator">A.Eades@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to identify any barriers or enablers as influences on wound care self-management by Indigenous people. A qualitative, interpretive study sought to investigate how participants perceived their wounds and their general health, and to identify the influences on them accessing wound care services. 

There is a dearth of information on culturally appropriate practice in wound management for Indigenous Australians. This research project was therefore significant in attempting to bridge the gap in nursing knowledge of Indigenous clients' perceptions of barriers and enablers for seeking wound care services,especially in relation to lower leg ulcers. The lack of culturally sensitive wound management practices potentially impacts on Indigenous clients' behaviours in seeking treatment from their health service providers.

Participant observations and semi-structured interviews with the research participants investigated the management of their wounds, and the ways in which their culture influences wound management. The main aim was to understand participants' comprehension of the importance of wound care through reflection. Understanding the enhancing or obstructive influences on wound management practices was expected to provide a foundation for teaching self care of wounds in Indigenous populations and inform health professionals' approach to health education. 

The data were analysed using thematic analysis, which generated common themes related to the research questions. These themes are: visibility, of the problem,4 perceived versus actual level of knowledge, acceptance of co-morbid health conditions and pre-determined path of ill health. These findings indicated that in one region, participants' perception of poor health was related to visibility of the problem. Participants chose to have their visible wounds managed by Silver Chain Nursing Association, whereas Diabetes and Hypertension and any other non-visible disorders were seen as appropriate to the Aboriginal Medical Service (AMS). Further to this finding, most participants displayed a sense of helplessness and hopelessness when sharing information about their diagnosis of diabetes, believing this was the norm. Many also believed that having a strong family history of a particular disease resulted in the participants also inheriting the disease. During post interview educational sessions many of the Indigenous participants were surprised by the evidence based-research reported to them by the researcher that diabetes is a manageable disease with life style changes.  

Another issue highlighted was the perceived level of knowledge the participants had about wound care. Reassurance was given by the participants that their level of knowledge about how to manage their wounds was adequate. However, none of the participants were concerned about the length of time that their wound/s had or were being managed, between 3 months and 5 years. This acceptance that although a wound is not getting any worse and not getting any better was the norm is cause for concern, and indicates a low level of health literacy. This theme was 'perceiving an imbalance in perceptions of wound care knowledge with actual knowledge'.  

The most important recommendation from the study findings is the need to consider health literacy more carefully in the development of health promotion and health education for Indigenous clients with wounds.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wound care</field><field name="subject">health iteracy</field><field name="subject">best practice</field><field name="subject">Indigenous health</field><field name="subject">primary health care</field><field name="subject">perceptions</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090702.111437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of tools for surveillance of Coxiella burnetii in domestic ruminants and Australian marsupials and their waste</field><field name="creator">M.Banazis@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to develop improved methods to detect viable Coxiella burnetii in wastes from livestock production.  The impetus for this work arose because there is a significant risk of infection for humans attributed to contact with waste products from the livestock production industry.  This situation is further compounded by the lack of suitable tools to detect viable C. burnetii in these wastes.  In addition, effective disinfection strategies for livestock wastes are also required to reduce the risk of infection with C. burnetii for individuals that come into contact with these waste products.

A quantitative real-time PCR system (qPCR) with high sensitivity and specificity was developed to detect the C. burnetii in environmental samples associated with domestic ruminants and native Australian marsupials.  Different detection chemistries and procedures were evaluated based on their sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility.  Overall it was found that the TaqMan PCR targeting the IS1111a locus provided the most sensitive and reproducible test.  The Geneworks PowerSoil(tm) DNA isolation kit provided the best compromise between reproducibility and recovery of DNA from livestock wastes.  When combined, the IS1111a TaqMan qPCR and Geneworks PowerSoil DNA Extraction Kit provided a test which was capable of detecting as few as two C. burnetii genome equivalents in 0.2g of soil or faeces.

Coxiella burnetii has been shown to display extreme resistance to environmental exposure.  Therefore, assessment of the viability of the organism in environmental matrices is more useful for risk assessment programs than detection of DNA alone.  A quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR was developed that was able to detect viable C. burnetii cells in soil.  The sensitivity of the assay was enhanced by heat-treating the soil samples prior to extraction of RNA.

The factor most often associated with transfer of C. burnetii to humans is exposure to livestock or their waste.  Therefore, decontamination of waste from livestock production industries is a key factor in preventing outbreaks of Q fever.  A system was developed to determine the efficacy of various disinfectant treatments against the environmental pathogen C. burnetii.  Treatments evaluated included sodium hypochlorite, ozone, ultraviolet light, peracetic acid (PAA), and Virkon S&#174;.  Sodium hypochlorite at a concentration of 0.1 mM reduced the infectivity of C. burnetii by over 92% while treatment with the same sodium hypochlorite concentration in wastewater showed significantly reduced efficacy.  Despite this reduced potency, sodium hypochlorite is still useful for control of C. burnetii in the liquid waste of animal production.

Commercially available ELISA and CFT assays exist for ruminants but there are no immunological tests available for detecting C. burnetii in marsupials even though Australian marsupials are known to be susceptible to C. burnetii.  An indirect ELISA for detecting anti-Coxiella antibodies in kangaroos was developed.  Paired serum and faecal samples were taken from 379 ruminants from Western Australia and the serum was tested with a commercially available ELISA and the complement fixation test while the faeces was tested using the qPCR developed during this study.  Paired serum and faecal samples were taken from 343 kangaroos from WA and were tested with the antibody-ELISA developed during this study and by qPCR. A very low prevalence of anti-Coxiella antibodies was observed in the ruminants sampled and results from immunological tests correlated poorly with qPCR data.  The development of an ELISA for use with kangaroo serum was problematic because of the lack of reference sera from animals known to be infected with C. burnetii.  Despite this results from the ELISA developed suggested that the apparent seroprevalence in the WA animals surveyed was approximately 34%.  Results from testing kangaroo faeces with the qPCR correlated poorly with the results from the antibody-ELISA.  These data suggest that kangaroos may be a significant reservoir of C. burnetii in Western Australia and due to cohabitation of kangaroos and domestic ruminants, may provide a link between the wildlife and domestic cycles of C. burnetii.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Q fever</field><field name="subject">Coxiella burnetii</field><field name="subject">marsupial</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">surveillance</field><field name="subject">detection</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090707.114918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preparation and Bioactivity of 1,8-Cineole Derivatives</field><field name="creator">A.Knight@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The naturally occurring monoterpene 1,3,3-trimethyl-2-oxabicyclo[2.2.2]octane 1, commonly named 1,8-cineole and the major component in the leaf oil of many eucalypts, exhibits bioactivity, being potentially antimicrobial and pesticidal.  A range of derivatives of 1,8-cineole and its naturally occurring isomeric analogue 1,4-cineole 2, 1-isopropyl-4-methyl-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, were synthesised.  High-cineole eucalyptus oil, 1,8-cineole and the 1,8- and 1,4-cineole derivatives were shown to have a dose dependent pre-emergence and post-emergence herbicidal activity against radish (Raphanus sativus var. Long Scarlet), and annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum) in laboratory bioassays.  A postulated increase in activity of the ester derivatives due to metabolic cleavage into their bioactive hydroxy-cineole and carboxylic acid portions after uptake by the plant was not observed.

The role of mallee eucalypts in the rehabilitation of degraded farmland in the Western Australian wheat belt, uses of eucalyptus oil and the bioactivity of essential oils and naturally occurring terpenes, with particular emphasis on eucalyptus oil and 1,8-cineole, were reviewed.  The review encompasses allelopathic and herbicidal activity, insecticidal, acaricidal and antimicrobial activity.

1,8-Cineole compounds functionalised at position 3 of the cyclohexane ring and the 1,4-cineole derivatives were chemically synthesised whilst 2-endo-hydroxy-1,8-cineole was obtained as the primary metabolite of a novel bacterium grown on 1,8-cineole as sole carbon source.  The bacteria were isolated by inoculating liquid growth medium containing 1,8-cineole as carbon source with aliquots of deionised water in which eucalyptus leaves had been stirred.  Sequencing of its 16S rRNA gene identified the bacteria as belonging to the order Sphingomonadales, family Sphingomonadaceae and genus Sphingomonas.  Growth curves for the bacterium are described and a metabolic pathway for the microbial degradation of 1,8-cineole is confirmed.  Bacteria were cultured on a 20 L scale to provide sufficient 2-endo-hydroxy-1,8-cineole for the herbicidal bioassays.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">herbicide</field><field name="subject">biotransformation</field><field name="subject">hydroxylated derivative</field><field name="subject">phytotoxicity</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090707.130931</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Value creation in a virtual world</field><field name="creator">Hales, Kieth R</field><field name="description">During the past two decades, increasingly powerful and capable information technologies have made information more accessible and valuable so that it has become the prime resource for business; ahead of the traditional resources of land, labour and capital. Improved information acquisition, usage and distribution has also driven and enabled globalisation. The emergence of the virtual enterprise (VE) is one consequence of changed market conditions and advanced information communications technology (ICT). VE s are characterised by various configurations of networks of collaborating partnerships and intensive ICT linkages. As ICT has become more pervasive, businesses have become increasingly reliant on it for their effective operation so now the question for business strategists is how to create value and sustainable competitive advantage in a virtual world? This thesis offers an answer to that question.This thesis uses rational arguments drawn from a wide variety of research from both the business and ICT disciplines to examine the theoretical foundations of value creation. It explores the development of corporate strategy and value driven sources of competitive advantage from the viewpoints of industrial organisation (IO), the resource based view (RBV) of the firm, innovation, transaction cost economics, network theory and value and supply chains. However, these established strategy theories, whose origins often predate the internet, do not adequately accommodate the expanded roles that information and digital technologies play in creating value in an increasingly digital environment. Alternately, Information Systems research, which is rich in information technology, struggles to accommodate the notion of value as legitimate information systems goal. Virtual organisation (VO) is a new strategic paradigm that is centred on the use of information and ICT to create value. VO is presented as a meta-management strategy that has application in all value oriented organisations. Within the concept of VO, the business model is an ICT based construct that bridges and integrates enterprise strategic and operational concerns.The Virtual Value Creation (VVC) framework is an innovative and novel business model that draws on the concept of virtual organisation. The VVC&#8217;s objective is to provide enterprises with a framework to determine their present and potential capability to use available information to create economic value. It owes its inspiration to Porter and Drucker, both of whom emphasised value creation as the legitimate focus for enterprise activity and the source of sustainable competitive advantage. The VVC framework integrates existing and emerging theories to describe the strategic processes and conditions necessary for the exploitation of information in a commercial setting.The VVC framework presently represents a novel and valuable tool that enterprises can use to assess their present and potential use of information to create value in a virtual age.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">virtual enterprise</field><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="subject">value creation</field><field name="subject">Computer Science (0984)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/hales</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solution biases and pheromone representation selection in ant colony optimisation</field><field name="creator">Montgomery, James</field><field name="description">Combinatorial optimisation problems (COPs) pervade human society: scheduling, design, layout, distribution, timetabling, resource allocation and project management all feature problems where the solution is some combination of elements, the overall value of which needs to be either maximised or minimised (i.e., optimised), typically subject to a number of constraints. Thus, techniques to efficiently solve such problems are an important area of research. A popular group of optimisation algorithms are the metaheuristics, approaches that specify how to search the space of solutions in a problem independent way so that high quality solutions are likely to result in a reasonable amount of computational time. Although metaheuristic algorithms are specified in a problem independent manner, they must be tailored to suit each particular problem to which they are applied. This thesis investigates a number of aspects of the application of the relatively new Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) metaheuristic to different COPs.The standard ACO metaheuristic is a constructive algorithm loosely based on the foraging behaviour of ant colonies, which are able to find the shortest path to a food source by indirect communication through pheromones. ACO&#8217;s artificial pheromone represents a model of the solution components that its artificial ants use to construct solutions. Developing an appropriate pheromone representation is a key aspect of the application of ACO to a problem. An examination of existing ACO applications and the constructive approach more generally reveals how the metaheuristic can be applied more systematically across a range of COPs. The two main issues addressed in this thesis are biases inherent in the constructive process and the systematic selection of pheromone representations.The systematisation of ACO should lead to more consistently high performance of the algorithm across different problems. Additionally, it supports the creation of a generalised ACO system, capable of adapting itself to suit many different combinatorial problems without the need for manual intervention.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Combinatorial optimisation problems</field><field name="subject">metaheuristic algorithms</field><field name="subject">Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO)</field><field name="subject">Computer Science (0984)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/montgomery</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is it because I'm gay? :the effect of sexual orientation on perceived discrimination: a cross-cultural study</field><field name="creator">Kim, Sarang</field><field name="description">Previous research have theorized that causes of the psychological distress faced by lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals (LGBs) are stigma and discrimination they face in the society. Perceptions of discrimination, whether it actually occurs or not, also affect behaviours. This project investigated whether non-heterosexuals (LGBs) perceive more discrimination than do heterosexuals in the same given situations. In Study 1, LGBs&#8217; levels of perceived discrimination in non-discriminatory situations (those where no actual discrimination took place) were compared with the responses of heterosexuals. In addition, Study 1 also examined which psychological well-being related variables (internalized  heterosexism (homophobia), marginalization, isolation, alienation, self-esteem, and satisfaction with life) contributed most to perceptions of discrimination. Five hundred and sixty adults (355 Korean, 205 Australian) participated in the study through an online survey. Major findings were: only the Australian LGBs but not the Korean LGBs showed significantly higher levels of perceived discrimination than did heterosexual counterparts. Using a priming stimulus did not increase the perception of discrimination; heterosexuals were more aware of others knowing their sexual orientation than LGBs. Alienation was the variable that most related to perceived discrimination. Study 1 had used only situations where no actual discrimination was included or intended. This study also showed that there were a number of differences between the Australian and Korean samples: Korean LGBs had significantly lower psychological well-being; and most of the Korean LGBs were in Stage 4 (acceptance) whereas the majority of Australian LGBs were in Stage 6 (synthesis). Further cross-cultural studies are needed. Study 2 examined the responses of perceived discrimination using an actual discriminatory scenario and a non-discriminatory scenario. It also examined the relationships between outness and perceived discrimination; and between previous experience of discrimination and perceived discrimination. Sixty six Australian university students (44 females, 21 males, and one gender unidentified) participated in this second study. Major findings were: significant differences were found in perceived discrimination between the nondiscriminatory and discriminatory scenario situations for all participants, between heterosexuals and LGBs, between lesbians and heterosexual women, but not between lesbian women and gay men. No correlation was found between outness and perceived discrimination in either the discriminatory or the non-discriminatory situations. However, previous experience of discrimination was correlated sharply with perceptions of discrimination in both scenarios.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Homophobia Australia</field><field name="subject">Gays Australia</field><field name="subject">Gays Korea</field><field name="subject">Homophobia Korea</field><field name="subject">Sociology, General (0626)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/3</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automated analysis of industrial scale security protocols</field><field name="creator">Plasto, Daniel</field><field name="description">Security protocols provide a communication architecture upon which security-sensitive distributed applications are built. Flaws in security protocols can expose applications to exploitation and manipulation. A number of formal analysis techniques have been applied to security protocols, with the ultimate goal of verifying whether or not a protocol fulfils its stated security requirements. These tools are limited in a number of ways. They are not fully automated and require considerable effort and expertise to operate. The specification languages often lack expressiveness. Furthermore the model checkers often cannot handle large industrial scale protocols due to the enormous number of states generated.Current research is addressing many of the limitations of the older tools by using state-of-the-art search optimisation and modelling techniques.

GATT obligations require trade measures to comply with national treatment (Article III) and most &#8211;favoured nation treatment (Article I) and to prohibit import and export restrictions (Article XI). GATT exceptions permit measures to protect human, animal or plant life or health (Article XX(b)) and to conserve exhaustible natural resources (Article XX(g). This thesis analyses the consistency of unilateral and multilateral environmental measures with these GATT obligations and exceptions. It argues that the Article XX exceptions should be interpreted according to the proximity of interest between the country using trade restrictions and the environmental problem. It argues further that Article XX should be interpreted in accordance with customary international law regarding sovereign equality, non-intervention and the doctrine of necessity. Applying the principle of sovereign equality to WTO rights, this thesis proposes that WTO provisions be designed and interpreted to compensate for the economic inequality of WTO members in order to ensure equal access to WTO rights. Moreover, the principle of non-intervention should be applied in the WTO context to prohibit economic coercion. Unilateral environmental trade restrictions fail both tests. They use economic coercion to intervene in the internal affairs of sovereign States and are available in practice only to countries with significant market power. However, the doctrine of necessity may be invoked to excuse the non-observance of WTO and other international obligations to permit the use of trade restrictions to address urgent environmental problems with which the enacting country has a jurisdictional nexus.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">World Trade Organization</field><field name="subject">Environmental law</field><field name="subject">International trade</field><field name="subject">Law (0398)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/condon</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Retirement  : effects of a psychoeducational program</field><field name="creator">Glenn Goold, Moyna</field><field name="description">The problem investigated in this research, comprising 2 studies, concerned factors influencing successful transition to retirement.

The role of corporate governance is to reduce the divergence of interests between shareholders and managers. The role of corporate governance is more useful when managers have an incentive to deviate from shareholders&#8217; interests. One example of management&#8217;s deviation from shareholders&#8217; interests is the management of earnings through the use of accounting accruals. Corporate governance is likely to reduce the incidence of earnings management. Corporate governance is also likely to improve investors&#8217; perception of the reliability of a firm&#8217;s performance, as measured by the earnings, in situations of earnings management. That is, corporate governance will be value relevant when earnings management exists. The results of this research support these propositions.In this thesis, the value relevance of earnings is measured using the earnings response coefficient. Earnings management is measured using the magnitude of abnormal accruals as estimated by the modified Jones (Dechow et al., 1995) model. A review of the corporate governance literature revealed nine attributes that were expected to impact on shareholders&#8217; perception of earnings reliability due to their role in enhancing the integrity of the financial reporting process. The nine attributes represent three categories of corporate governance: 1) organisational monitoring; 2) incentive alignment; and 3) governance structure.Although not all corporate governance attributes suggested in the literature impact on investors&#8217; perception of a firm&#8217;s performance, the primary proposition that corporate governance affects this perception when earnings are managed is supported. The primary contribution of the study is finding evidence supporting the moderating effect of earnings management on the relationship between corporate governance and the value relevance of earnings. These results validate Hutchinson and Gul&#8217;s (2004) claim that the role of corporate governance attributes in firm performance should be evaluated in concurrence with a firm&#8217;s organisational environment. Future research should control for corporate governance and earnings management, as indicators of earnings reliability, when using returns-earnings regressions to address a research question.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corporate governance</field><field name="subject">corporate profits</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management (0454)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/bugshan</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of mental health gains in adolescents who participate in a structured day treatment program</field><field name="creator">Fothergill, Jennifer</field><field name="description">A day treatment program is an important component on the continuum of care for young people with moderate to severe mental health issues. The aim of this research was to investigate whether adolescents who participate in a structured day treatment program demonstrate greater mental health gains than adolescents receiving less intensive outpatient treatment. In addition, the research investigated whether mental health gains were related to intake diagnosis and whether parents reported higher levels of mental health gain than the client in their self-report ratings. The setting for the research was The Cottage, an adolescent day treatment program, run by the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) in the Australian Capital Territory. The program provides intense multi-faceted treatment within a therapeutic milieu environment for clients aged 12-18 years with moderate to severe mental health issues. The study involved a Day Program group of 22 clients from The Cottage and included a comparison group of 20 outpatient clients from CAMHS. Results indicated that individuals in both treatment approaches had statistically significant reductions in anxiety and depression symptomology and improvements in outcome measures, but there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups. The data indicated a statistically significant difference in return to school rates, whereby approximately 82% of individuals in the day treatment program had returned to school/employment, whilst only 30% of individuals in outpatient treatment had returned to school/employment within three months post treatment. The results did not demonstrate that the degree of mental health gain was dependent upon intake diagnosis and although not statistically significant, parents rated their children as more severe in terms of psychopathology than the client.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teenagers mental health</field><field name="subject">Counselling of teenagers</field><field name="subject">Mental disorders in adolescence</field><field name="subject">Health Sciences, General (0566)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/fothergill</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utility, rationality and beyond: from behavioral finance to informational finance</field><field name="creator">Bhattacharya, Sukanto</field><field name="description">This work covers a substantial mosaic of related concepts in utility theory as applied to financial decision-making. It reviews some of the classical notions of Benthamite utility and the normative utility paradigm offered by the von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility theory; exploring its major pitfalls before moving into what is postulated as an entropic notion of utility. Extrinsic utility is proposed as a cardinally measurable quantity; measurable in terms of the expected information content of a set of alternative choices. The entropic notion of utility is subsequently used to model the financial behavior of individual investors based on their governing risk-return preferences involving financial structured products manufactured out of complex, multi-asset options. Evolutionary superiority of the Black-Scholes function in dynamic hedging scenarios is computationally demonstrated using a haploid genetic algorithm model programmed in Borland C. The work explores, both theoretically and computationally, the psycho-cognitive factors governing the financial behavior of individual investors both in the presence as well as absence of downside risk and postulates the concepts of resolvable and irresolvable risk. A formal theorem of consistent preference is proposed and proved. The work also analyzes the utility of an endogenous capital guarantee built within a financial structured product. The aspect of investor empowerment is discussed in terms of how financial behavior of an investor may be transformed if he or she is allowed a choice of one or more assets that may gain entry into the financial structured product. Finally there is a concluding section wherein the different facets are placed in their proper perspective and a number of interesting future research directions are also proposed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Individual investors</field><field name="subject">Utility theory</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Financial institutions investments management</field><field name="subject">Economics, Finance (0508)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/bhattacharya</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical analysis of the teaching of hospitality at Marymount College</field><field name="creator">Jenkins, Gayle</field><field name="description">Historically, vocational subjects have been a part of the Australian school curricula for 200 years. In early school curriculum the vocational aspect was considered to be related to the acquisition of manual skills such as domestic science or woodwork, rather than careers. From the 1950s to mid 1980s, vocational education, focused specifically on career and job training, was the responsibility of the technical colleges, which had been established to develop these skills. The concept of high schools targeting identified skills for the future work force, and hence becoming involved in the vocational skill development of youth, developed in the mid 1980s in Australia. Industry influence on governments to make educational decisions based on economic initiatives has increased over this time.Major growth has occurred in Vocational Education and Training (VET) in schools, with student participation rates in vocational education trebling in the past six (6) years (House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training, 2004). This increase is predicted to continue as VET qualifications and the process of accreditation is improved and becomes increasingly user-friendly (Polesel, 2004). The focus on vocational education and industry needs is recognised as an economic necessity for Australia. Schools and teachers, however, need to balance the demands of industry and government with the holistic educational needs of the youth they are entrusted to teach.The school curriculum currently offers a broad range of subject choices that provide for diverse student needs. However the rapid growth of vocational education in schools has impeded effective reflective practices of current vocational programs. Vocational education is experiencing a boom due to the increasing popularity of vocational subjects. The planning and implementation of the diverse subject offerings at school level is often a response to immediate needs rather than in-depth analysis and evaluation. For this reason, it is timely for a critical analysis of the current Hospitality programs in schools to ensure currency and relevancy of content and implementation.The project was localised to one school to enable an extensive and thorough analysis of the Hospitality program. Marymount College is a co-educational Catholic College of approximately 1050 students. Located in the Gold Coast suburb of Burleigh, Marymount College offers a wide range of VET subjects ranging across the five (5) industry areas of Information Technology, Business, Marine Science, Industrial Skills and Hospitality &amp; Tourism.The aim of the analysis will be to suggest what measures need to be implemented in the programs at Marymount College, Gold Coast, Burleigh, Australia, to ensure best practice in Hospitality vocational education. These measures can be constructively applied to other Queensland schools currently delivering vocational education and Hospitality, or to those schools considering introducing subjects associated with Hospitality.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vocational school students</field><field name="subject">Competency based education</field><field name="subject">Hospitality industry</field><field name="subject">Education, Vocational (0747)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/jenkins</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of the effects of outcome desirability and agency appraisals on emotions and consumer decision-making processes</field><field name="creator">Watson, Lisa</field><field name="description">Researchers have traditionally focused on the dimensions of valence and arousal when studying how affect, mood and emotions influence consumer decision-making processes. As a result, it was concluded that negative emotions were associated with more systematic processing and positive emotions were related to more heuristic processing (Tiedens and Linton, 2001). However, recent studies of the effects of emotions on consumer decision-making have shown that emotions with the same valence and arousal level can lead to different response behaviours (Lerner and Keltner, 2000; Ragunathan and Pham, 1999; Tiedens and Linton, 2001; Yi and Baumgartner, 2004). Cognitive appraisals have been offered as an avenue for explaining these differences (Bagozzi, Gopinath and Nyer, 1999; Ruth, Brunel and Otnes, 2002; Tiedens and Linton, 2001); however, a comprehensive theory of their effects on decision-making has yet to emerge. This three study research program tests whether the cognitive appraisals of outcome desirability and agency combine to offer a more comprehensive explanation of emotion&#8217;s effect on consumer decision-making processes than has been offered to date. Outcome desirability and agency are proposed to influence decision-making processes both directly and through the mediating influence of emotions. Results show that emotions mediate relationships between outcome desirability and agency appraisals and consumer decision-making processes. There is some evidence to suggest that agency driven emotions differentially influence consumer decision-making processes and outcomes.

The new tax consolidation legislation allows wholly-owned groups to be regarded as one homogenous entity for income tax purposes from 1st of July 2002. After making an irrevocable decision to implement the elective consolidation provisions, a group, consisting of a head company and at least one other wholly-owned entity (company, trust or partnership), lodges a single income tax return and pays a single set of PAYG instalments over the period of consolidation. The assessment of the policies, principles and rules governing the implementation and operation of the consolidation regime reveals far-reaching implications for the accessibility of tax attributes and changes to the tax cost / adjusted values of capital / depreciating assets. Tax accounting systems and corporate governance guidelines established by groups are also affected. Groups deciding against the implementation of the consolidation rules, on the other hand, face the removal of previous grouping concessions, such as loss transfer provisions, CGT asset roll-overs and inter-corporate dividend rebates. Furthermore, a number of modified anti-avoidance and integrity measures affect intra-group transactions undertaken outside the consolidation regime. This thesis identifies and analyses the areas of taxation, accounting and corporate governance which are relevant for the initial consolidation decision. The following analysis is structured with primary regard to legal concepts stipulated by the consolidation legislation. However, frequent references to policies underlying the relevant provisions, for instance the wholly-owned approach, allow a deeper understanding of the consolidation core rules and the effects arising for groups deciding to implement them. Finally, this thesis also provides a comparative perspective through the discussion of consolidation policies and rules delivered by German tax legislation, accounting regulations and corporations law.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporations Taxation Consolidated returns</field><field name="subject">Corporate governance law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Law (0398)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/schostok</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in the Republic of China</field><field name="creator">Wu, Chen-Huan</field><field name="description">This thesis not only seeks to demonstrate the requirements of and procedures for recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in the Republic of China (ROC), but also explores whether ROC&#8217;s legislation and practices regarding recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards comply with international &#8216;best practice&#8217; standards as contained in the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York Convention) and the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (UNCITRAL Model Law. Even though ROC&#8217;s former legislation and practices did not conform to these standards, the present legislation and practices do comply with the New York Convention and the UNCITRAL Model Law. Although ROC and the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) both insist on a &#8216;one China&#8217; policy and each claims that it represents the whole of China, each has its own legal system. Nonetheless, ROC adopted the &#8216;regional conflict of laws&#8217; theory based on the concept of &#8216;one country, two regions&#8217; to deal with cases relating to recognition and enforcement arbitral awards rendered in PRC. In the context of that theory, this thesis explores the requirements of and procedures for recognition and enforcement of PRC arbitral awards in ROC, and whether there are any deficiencies in this regard. The thesis concludes that the ROC legislation and practices regarding recognition and enforcement of PRC arbitral awards in ROC are consistent with the New York Convention and the UNCITRAL Model Law. The government of PRC resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao from 1 July 1997 and 20 December 1999 respectively. However, PRC adopted the principle of &#8216;one country, two systems&#8217;. PRC authorizes the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong SAR) and the Macao Special Administrative Region (Macao SAR) to exercise a high degree of autonomy and to enjoy executive, legislative and independent judicial, including that of final adjudication. Thus, the ROC legislation deems that Hong Kong and Macao arbitral awards are foreign arbitral awards in ROC. So, the legislation and practices regarding recognition and enforcement of Hong Kong arbitral awards and Macao arbitral awards also are in conformity with the New York Convention and the UNCITRAL Model Law. Moreover, the legislation and practices regarding recognition and enforcement of foreign, PRC, Hong Kong, and Macao arbitral awards go further than international standards set out by the New York Convention and the UNCITRAL Model Law. Applying for recognition or enforcement of a foreign, PRC, Hong Kong, or Macao arbitral award, an original arbitration agreement or an original arbitral award can be substituted by an electronic format, which was made originally and can show the whole text as well as can be downloaded for examination. Furthermore, the courts of ROC construe the limitations regarding recognition or enforcement foreign, PRC, Hong Kong, or Macao arbitral awards narrowly. In addition, even though the ROC legislation regarding recognition and enforcement of foreign, Hong Kong, and Macao arbitral awards adopts the principle of reciprocity, the ROC Courts adopt the notion of comity. The thesis clarifies recognition and enforcement of PRC arbitral awards in Hong Kong, and recognition and enforcement of Hong Kong arbitral awards in PRC as well. Hong Kong arbitral awards are enforceable in PRC, and PRC arbitral awards also are enforceable in Hong Kong in accordance with the Arrangement Concerning Mutual Enforcement of Arbitral Awards Between Mainland and the Hong Kong SAR 2000 (PRC) and the Arbitration (Amendment) Ordinance 2000 (Hong Kong SAR) respectively based on the principle of &#8216;one country, two systems&#8217;. Both the provisions of the Arrangement Concerning Mutual Enforcement of Arbitral Awards Between Mainland and the Hong Kong SAR 2000 (PRC) and the Arbitration (Amendment) Ordinance 2000 (Hong Kong SAR) comply with the international standards set out in the New York Convention and the UNCITRAL Model Law.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conflict of laws</field><field name="subject">Arbitration and award</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Law (0398)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/wu</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public perceptions of counsellors: a survey of knowledge and attitudes to counsellors on the Gold Coast</field><field name="creator">Agnew, Carol</field><field name="description">This survey sought to determine the public perceptions and knowledge of counsellors on the Gold Coast and Northern New South Wales. Comprising of two studies, this paper extended on previous research conducted by Rogers and Sharpley (1983), Sharpley, Rogers and Evans (1984), and Sharpley (1986). Study I included a representative sample of 226 members of the general public, plus a sample of 105 medical practitioners. Respondents were asked to complete a 24-item questionnaire regarding their perceptions and knowledge of counsellors. Four questions were designed to investigate whether or not distinctions could be made between counsellors, psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers. An additional seven questions were included for only medical practitioners to answer and sought to determine whether or not, and under what circumstances, medical practitioners would refer to a counsellor. These questions were also concerned with establishing what value medical practitioners would place on having a counsellor working as a team member of their practice.The results of Study I indicated that both the general public and medical practitioners viewed counsellors positively. Results further showed that the confusion and lack of knowledge reported by respondents from the last Australian study conducted by Sharpley (1986), was no longer evident. Study II was designed to assess the validity of the reported sources that respondents from Study I indicated that they would utilise in order to access a counsellor. Three samples were involved in Study II. The first sample comprised of 60 medical receptionists, the second sample included 25 counsellors listed in the yellow pages telephone directory, while the third sample involved 6 community centres listed in the yellow pages telephone directory. However, the results of Study II showed that counsellors were not as readily accessible from these sources as was perceived by respondents from Study I. Hence, it could be concluded that counsellors need to involve themselves with promotion and education if they are to maintain the positive regard indicated by the respondents of this study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Counseling Queensland Gold Coast Public opinion</field><field name="subject">Counselors Queensland Gold Coast Public opinion</field><field name="subject">Health Sciences, General (0566)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/agnew</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The authoritarian personality in the 21st century</field><field name="creator">Norris, Gareth</field><field name="description">This thesis began largely as an exploration into right-wing political ideology and its relationship to The Authoritarian Personality proposed by Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswick, Levinson and Sanford (1950). It had initially been envisaged that contemporary examples would manifest themselves within many neo-Fascist or &#8216;White Pride&#8217; style organisations and as an adage to their supposed historical underpinnings, would therefore be representative of modern day authoritarianism. As previously discovered by Eysenck and Coulter (1974) in their examination of British Fascists and Communists, the authoritarian syndrome is somewhat more complex to explain by way of reference to a number of radical semi-political organisations. Subsequently, the thesis was to take on a deeper and more philosophical direction as various parts of the literature were analysed and critiqued. And indeed to some extent the original proposal was abandoned in favour of a richer and more conceptual approach to our understanding of authoritarianism. This was discovered to be distinctly missing from the majority of the current literature in the field.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Authoritarianism (Personality trait)</field><field name="subject">Psychology, Personality (0625)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/norris</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Class of Direct Search Methods for Nonlinear Integer Programming</field><field name="creator">Sugden, Stephen J</field><field name="description">This work extends recent research in the development of a number of direct search methods in nonlinear integer programming. The various algorithms use an extension of the well-known FORTRAN MINOS code of Murtagh and Saunders as a starting point. MINOS is capable of solving quite large problems in which the objective function is nonlinear and the constraints linear. The original MINOS code has been extended in various ways by Murtagh, Saunders and co-workers since the original 1978 landmark paper. Extensions have dealt with methods to handle both nonlinear constraints, most notably MINOS/AUGMENTED and integer requirements on a subset of the variables(MINTO). The starting point for the present thesis is the MINTO code of Murtagh. MINTO is a direct descendant of MINOS in that it extends the capabilities to general nonlinear constraints and integer restrictions. The overriding goal for the work described in this thesis is to obtain a good integer-feasible or near-integer-feasible solution to the general NLIP problem while trying to avoid or at least minimize the use of the ubiquitous branch-and-bound techniques. In general, we assume a small number of nonlinearities and a small number of integer variables.Some initial ideas motivating the present work are summarised in an invited paper presented by Murtagh at the 1989 CTAC (Computational Techniques and Applications) conference in Brisbane, Australia. The approach discussed there was to start a direct search procedure at the solution of the continuous relaxation of a nonlinear mixed-integer problem by first removing integer variables from the simplex basis, then adjusting integer-infeasible superbasic variables, and finally checking for local optimality by trial unit steps in the integers. This may be followed by a reoptimization with the latest point as the starting point, but integer variables held fixed. We describe ideas for the further development of Murtagh&#8217;s direct search method. Both the old and new approaches aim to attain an integer-feasible solution from an initially relaxed (continuous) solution. Techniques such as branch-and-bound or Scarf&#8217;s neighbourhood search [84] may then be used to obtain a locally optimal solution. The present range of direct search methods differs significantly to that described by Murtagh, both in heuristics used and major and minor steps of the procedures. Chapter 5 summarizes Murtagh&#8217;s original approach while Chapter 6 describes the new methods in detail.Afeature of the new approach is that some degree of user-interaction (MINTO/INTERACTIVE) has been provided, so that a skilled user can "drive" the solution towards optimality if this is desired. Alternatively the code can still be run in "automatic" mode, where one of five available direct search methods may be specified in the customary SPECS file. A selection of nonlinear integer programming problems taken from the literature has been solved and the results are presented here in the latter chapters. Further, anewcommunications network topology and allocation model devised by Berry and Sugden has been successfully solved by the direct search methods presented herein. The results are discussed in Chapter 14, where the approach is compared with the branch-and-bound heuristic.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nonlinear integer programming</field><field name="subject">direct search method</field><field name="subject">Computer Science (0984)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/sugden</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A collaboration framework of selecting software components based on behavioural compatibility with user requirements</field><field name="creator">Wang, Lei</field><field name="description">Building software systems from previously existing components can save time and effort while increasing productivity. The key to a successful Component-Based Development (CBD) is to get the required components. However, components obtained from other developers often show different behaviours than what are required. Thus adapting the components into the system being developed becomes an extra development and maintenance cost. This cost often offsets the benefits of CBD. Our research goal is to maximise the possibility of finding components that have the required behaviours, so that the component adaptation cost can be minimised. Imprecise component specifications and user requirements are the main reasons that cause the difficulty of finding the required components. Furthermore, there is little support for component users and developers to collaborate and clear the misunderstanding when selecting components, as CBD has two separate development processes for them. In this thesis, we aim at building a framework in which component users and developers can collaborate to select components with tools support, by exchanging component and requirement specifications. These specifications should be precise enough so that behavioural mismatches can be detected. We have defined Simple Component Interface Language (SCIL) as the communication and specification language to capture component behaviours. A combined SCIL specification of component and requirement can be translated to various existing modelling languages. Thus various properties that are supported by those languages can be checked by the related model checking tools. If all the user-required properties are satisfied, then the component is compatible to the user requirement at the behavioural level. Thus the component can be selected. Based on SCIL, we have developed a prototype component selection system and used it in two case studies: finding a spell checker component and searching for the components for a generic e-commerce application. The results of the case studies indicate that our approach can indeed find components that have the required behaviours. Compared to the traditional way of searching by keywords, our approach is able to get more relevant results, so the cost of component adaptation can be reduced. Furthermore, with a collaborative selection process this cost can be minimised. However, our approach has not achieved complete automation due to the modelling inconsistency from different people. Some manual work to adjust user requirements is needed when using our system. The future work will focus on solving this remaining problem of inconsistent modelling, providing an automatic trigger to select proper tools, etc.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Component software</field><field name="subject">Computer software development</field><field name="subject">Computer Science (0984)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/wang</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transmission of copyrighted works over the internet : rights and exceptions</field><field name="creator">Tao, Hong</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the balance between copyright owners and users by studying the nature of the rights and exceptions related to transmission of copyrighted works over the internet, focusing on three different jurisdictions: Australia, Japan and the United States.The choice of Japan and the United States is based on consideration of the following elements: 1.

It will make Internet technologies, such as the web, email, instant messaging, presence, and videoconferencing available nearly everywhere. Presence is one of the basic services that is likely to become omnipresent in IMS. It is the service that allows a user to be informed about the reachability, availability, and willingness of communication of another user. Push to talk over Cellular (PoC) is another service in IMS that is intended to provide rapid communications for business and consumer customers of mobile networks. In order to become a truly successful mass-market service for the consumer segment, the only realistic alternative is a standardized Push-to-talk solution providing full interoperability between terminals and operators. Instant Messaging (IM) is the service that allows an IMS user to send some content to another user in near real-time. This service works under IETF&#8217;s Message Session Relay protocol (MSRP) to overcome the congestion control problem. We believe the efficiency of these services along with the mobility management in IMS session establishment has not been sufficiently investigated.In this research work, we identify the key issues to improve the existing protocols in IMS for better system behaviour. The work is centred on the three services of IMS: (1) Presence Service, (2) Push-to-Talk over cellular and, (3) Instant Messaging and over the issue of (4) IMS session set up. The existing session establishment scenario of IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) suffers from triangular routing for a certain period of time when an end IMS user or terminal is mobile. In this thesis, the performance of three possible session establishment scenarios in a mobile environment is compared by using an analytical model. The model is developed based on the expressions of cost functions, which represents system delay and overhead involved in sessions&#8217; establishment. The other problem areas in optimizing presence service, dimensioning a PoC service and analysing service rates of IM relay extensions in IMS are identified. A presence server becomes overloaded when massive number of IMS terminals joins a network to request presence facility. Performance models are developed in this research to mitigate such load during heavy traffic for the presence service. Queuing analyses for different cases are provided while instant messaging chunks go through two consecutive relay nodes. The specific factors such as blocking probability, stability conditions, optimized subscription lifetime etc. in IMS environment parameters have been investigated. We have also elaborated models to dimension a PoC service for service providers with regards to controlling PoC session access, optimal PoC session timer, path optimization and number of allowable simultaneous PoC sessions for given network grade of service.In a nutshell, the contribution of this dissertation are: (a) a proposed robust scheduler to improve performance of the IMS presence service, (b) several derived models to dimension IMS Push-to-talk over cellular service, (c) a new mechanism to reduce cost for the IMS session set ups in mobile environment and (d) evaluation of message blocking and stability in IMS Instant Messaging (IM) service by applying queuing theories. All of these analyses have resulted in recommendations for the performance enhancements with optimal resource utilization in IMS framework.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Internet telephony</field><field name="subject">Computer Science (0984)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/alam</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical analysis of the extent to which the personal civil rights recognised in the constitution of the Russian Federation are enjoyed under Russian law</field><field name="creator">Rapoport, Yuri</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the Russian Constitution 1993 and the legislation flowing from it against the background of the former (Soviet) constitutions and international human rights instruments at the beginning of Russia&#8217;s path towards democratization.Research for the thesis was conducted over a period of four years (1998 - 2002) during particular political and economic instability in the country following the financial crisis of 17 August 1998.A review was conducted of Russian laws that aim to protect, what are arguably the most fundamental rights of any democratic constitutional system - civil rights. Unlike political rights (which relate to the system of government), civil rights are the rights to liberty and equality granted to citizens of a country.The civil rights enumerated in this thesis are known as &#8216;natural&#8217; rights, and include the right to life; right to personal inviolability, right to privacy; right to dignity and good reputation; the freedom of information, movement, religion, language and nationality. These rights, are also referred to as &#8216;personal civil rights&#8217;, which is the term used in this thesis.The thesis presents a critical analysis of personal civil rights proclaimed in the Russian Constitution, demonstrating that although their articulation accords with international standards, there are obvious problems associated with economic and political factors that limit their enjoyment by Russian people.Most of the research for this thesis was conducted in Russia, providing a specific insight into the political, social and economic peculiarities (such as enduring totalitarian idiosyncrasies, and a prevailing context of corruption) the full extent of which is difficult to perceive from outside the country. Since, these peculiarities have a direct influence on the administration of justice in Russia, the thesis refers to local literature sources that contain an intimate knowledge of the effect of these factors on Russia&#8217;s current legal system.Chapter 1 of the thesis discusses the history and modern understanding of personal rights, as well as relevant parts of the current Russian Constitution, including how these differ from the previous constitutions. Subsequent chapters (2-9) discuss selected personal civil rights, which are particularly important in the context of Russian social, political, economic and legislative development; namely the rights to life and personal inviolability, privacy, dignity; and the freedom of information, movement, language nationality and religion,. These rights are at the core of any democratic constitutional system as they are essential in securing fundamental human freedoms.The Conclusion then summarizes the extent to which the personal civil rights proclaimed by the Russian Constitution are enjoyed by Russian people in light of Russia&#8217;s present political and economic reality. For most of the rights discussed, specific problems are identified and suggestions made as to what measures may be taken in order to overcome them.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Russia (Federation) Constitution</field><field name="subject">Russia (Federation) Constitutional law</field><field name="subject">Civil rights Russia (Federation)</field><field name="subject">Human rights Russia (Federation)</field><field name="subject">Law (0398)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/rapoport3</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Animals in the landscape :an analysis of the role of the animal image in representations of identity in selected Australian feature films from 1971 to 2001</field><field name="creator">Forscher, Helene</field><field name="description">Despite the salient role of the landscape in the development of white Australian identity, and the prominence of the landscape discourse in dominant film commentary, little attention has been afforded to the function of the animal image as a cultural representational code in the context of the meanings educed. The aim of this study is to examine the animal and human-animal representations in selected Australian films released between 1971 and 2001, and to establish the various ways in which such a focus foregrounds significations which offer new, or more complex, articulations of Australian identity.This study was confined to live-action representations of animals, not necessarily as central figures, in Australian feature films. Within the three-decade time-frame, the films chosen for analysis were selected to provide illustrations of the main hypothesis through a range of narrative themes and genres. The films considered include those recognised as forerunners to the Revival (e.g. Walkabout and Wake in Fright); classics of the Revival (e.g. Picnic at Hanging Rock and The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith); Australian produced international commercial successes (e.g. The Man From Snowy River and Crocodile Dundee); as well as films which have fallen off the radar of recent Australian film commentary (e.g. Mad Dog Morgan and Long Weekend), and those that never made it into the matrix of intellectual representational discourse (e.g. Howling III: The Marsupials and Razorback). The films were analysed as open-ended metaphors, allowing for negotiated and oppositional readings. The images and the narratives of the films were interpreted using qualitative methods grounded ontologically in a mixed method semiotic approach. All representational modes were considered: image, symbol, analogy, allegory, metaphor or metonymy. Where appropriate, cultural, psychological and behavioural theories from reception studies were employed to describe or decode textual effects. The discussion addresses overt messages and alternate interpretations. The dominant meanings were considered from the social reflection perspective and where pertinent, analysed through social imaginary theory.The analysis found that Walkabout functions as the seminal text in the study of animal symbolism, human-animal representation and the objective or &#8216;ecological&#8217; perspective in post-Revival Australian cinema. The film introduces a new mode and style of animal representation evident in many subsequent Australian films. Films set around the time of Federation featuring marginalised protagonists and the landscape are found to be nationing allegories, presenting themes of equal import and greater contemporary relevance than those of male representation. More recent films with marginalised protagonists exhibit a shift in focus from the concerns of emerging nationhood to those of Australia&#8217;s emerging cosmopolitanism. In representations of masculinity and the landscape, the privileging of the physical activity of human-animal interaction resituates the texts beyond the customary matrices of patriarchal affirmation and the promotion of a pastoral ethos. Themes of humananimal &#8216;mateship&#8217; and inter-species egalitarianism are identified, as well as the presentation of conflict resolution through symbolic metamorphosis into animality. The films are revealed to be a more complex exposition of Australian identity than previously recognised, marking a distinct development in the progression of national representations towards an environmentally aware ethos.Analysis of the horror genre foregrounds the nexus between Australian identity, assimilation and metamorphosis into animality. The feral/indigenous dichotomy is identified as a key trope in Australian representation and the portrayal of particular modes of human-animal relationships are seen to function as indicators of deviance in characterisation. The discussion also highlights the way in which the privileging of animal representations works to emphasise the universality of the films&#8217; concerns, while simultaneously grounding them in a specific culture and location. Principally, the findings in this study confirm my original proposition that animal-centred readings of the selected films would reveal a rich seam of fresh interpretative possibilities relevant to the discourse of Australian national cinema and identity. I have also argued that many of the cultural significations and thematic nuances offered by the texts have been overlooked or misinterpreted by a dominant commentary which repeats the omissions inherent in the viewpoint of the sublime aesthetic by failing to recognise the codes and conventions signified in the detail of the filmic representations.More broadly, this study exemplifies the ways in which animal-centred readings not only resituate certain texts within the cannon of Australian national cinema, but how depictions of animals and the human-animal relationship function simultaneously as both nationing and universalising tropes. By admitting animal-focused discussion into the norms of Australian cultural criticism and textual discourse, the resulting significations connect the texts with a global contemporary inflection in existential concern: namely that of the relationship between humans and the environment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animals in motion pictures</field><field name="subject">Photography of animals</field><field name="subject">Cinema (0900)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/forscher</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choice of law in state contracts in economic development sector: is there party autonomy?</field><field name="creator">Bordukh, Oyunchimeg</field><field name="description">A state contract is a common mode of entry for foreign direct investment, especially in developing states. It can form the legal basis of the investment relationship between a foreign investor and a host government. But, like any other contract, it cannot stand itself covering all aspects of the legal relationship. The contract thus must belong to a specific legal system or a body of rules or principles which is usually called &#8220;applicable law &#8220;or &#8220;governing law&#8221;.Historically, a &#8220;concession contract&#8221; in the natural resources sector was the predominant form of a state contract and it used to be governed by the domestic law of each host state. However, since the 1950s, international investment arbitrations have abandoned the tradition and advanced a theory subjecting state contracts in the foreign investment sector to an external legal system, ie public international law. One of the bases of the theory of internationalisation was the principle of party autonomy that allows parties to a state contract to select any law of whatever country they like. Then, the 1965 Washington Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID Convention)1 formally adopted the principle of party autonomy in Article 42 (1) as the primary choice of law rule in disputes arising out a foreign investment contract concluded between a state and a national of another state.The object of this thesis is to prove that the fundamental problems of party autonomy in foreign investment contracts involving considerations of public and private law issues remain unsettled. It explores the main controversies and confusions in the theory of internationalising state contracts, looking at its historical context. It examines the extent of the application of party autonomy in state contracts such as natural resource exploitation contracts and construction of a plant and infrastructure contracts which reflect important economic development policies of developing countries.In considering past and current problems in the field of international investment law, the thesis argues that arbitral tribunals resolving disputes between a state and a foreign private individual should abandon the party autonomy approach because contractual freedom to choose the law of the contract would disregard the objectives which host states normally pursue through economic regulations such as development, environment and human rights concerns of foreign investment. It suggests a consensus-based approach similar to the rule adopted in the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Certain Rights in Respect of Securities (Hague Securities Convention)2 and which would produce the desired effect. It recommends that the choice of law provisions found in Article 42 of ICSID Convention would need to be either modified or repealed. In doing so, this thesis attempts to contribute to the positive development of international investment law balancing state authority and private property rights.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Investments Foreign (International law)</field><field name="subject">Arbitration and award</field><field name="subject">Law (0398)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/bordukh</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Auditor orientation, strategies and tactics in audit negotiations</field><field name="creator">Hollindale, Janice</field><field name="description">This study&#8217;s primary objectives are to establish the dimensions, strategies, and tactics used by auditors in the negotiation of sensitive disclosure issues with clients. These issues are typically addressed at the end of the audit and are the primary concern of the audit partner and senior manager. This study uses the tactics established in the negotiation research to test if auditors use the same groups of tactics, and whether these tactics are related by some underlying dimensions, and their relevant strategies.  Multidimensional scaling found that there are four dimensions to the tactics that auditors use. During negotiations with their clients, auditors employ tactics representing the underlying dimensions which can be interpreted as &#8220;Concern for Self&#8221;, &#8220;Concern for Client&#8221;, &#8220;Concern for Others&#8221;, and &#8220;Concern for Accounting Principles&#8221;. Results of cluster analysis established four primary classifications to the 38 auditor tactics. These are &#8220;Facilitating&#8221;, &#8220;Contextual&#8221;, &#8220;Forcing/asserting&#8221;, and &#8220;Appeal to authority&#8221;. Within these four classifications, twelve sub-categories were observed. These findings reinforce the complexities inherent in the resolution of an audit conflict, and suggest that auditors group together certain tactics for use as called for in the circumstances with which they are dealing.  This research contributes to theory within the fields of auditing and general negotiation because it has established that the two-dimensional model of concern that has formed the basis of much behavioural research is insufficient to describe an auditor&#8217;s responsibilities. There are four dimensions of concern. While some researchers have proposed a three-dimensional model of negotiation for auditors, the fourth dimension identified in this study is a contribution. This research expands current knowledge fundamental to the audit discipline by establishing the negotiation tactics used by auditors and their underlying multidimensionality, and thus has extended the knowledge of audit conflict management beyond that of strategy-level. Accordingly,this research is beneficial to practicing auditors and for the education of auditors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Confidential communications Australia Auditing</field><field name="subject">Disclosure of information Australia Auditing</field><field name="subject">Economics, Commerce - Business (0505)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/hollindale</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tamper-resistant peer-to-peer storage for file integrity checking</field><field name="creator">Zangerl, Alexander</field><field name="description">One of the activities of most successful intruders of a computer system is to modify data on the victim,either to hide his/her presence and to destroy the evidence of the break-in, or to subvert the system completely and make it accessible for further abuse without triggering alarms.File integrity checking is one common method to mitigate the effects of successful intrusions by detecting the changes an intruder makes to files on a computer system. Historically file integrity checking has been implemented using tools that operate locally on a single system, which imposes quite some restrictions regardingmaintenance and scalability. Recent improvements for large scale environments have introduced trusted central servers which provide secure fingerprint storage and logging facilities, but such centralism presents some new shortcomings.This thesis describes an alternative, decentralised approach where peer-to-peer mechanisms are used to provide fingerprint storage for file integrity checking with more flexibility and scalability than offered by currently available systems. A research implementation has been developed to verify the approach as viable and practical, and experimental results obtained with that prototype are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Peer-to-peer architecture (Computer networks)</field><field name="subject">Computer security</field><field name="subject">Consumer protection</field><field name="subject">Computer Science (0984)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/zangerl</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Common-law and civil-law legal families : a misleading categorisation</field><field name="creator">Landskron, Rolf</field><field name="description">This thesis examines common-law and civil-law jurisdictions in order to find differences between them. These differences are then being qualified as either relevant or irrelevant for the categorisation of individual jurisdictions. This reflects the argument that only features occurring in only one of the legal families can be relevant when categorising jurisdictions. Only such features can be, from the author&#8217;s point of view, specific and typical for their legal family and inherent features of them.The first thing to be considered under this premise is the respective sources of law (Chapter 1). These are in civil-law jurisdictions traditionally statutes and in commonlaw jurisdictions predominantly courts&#8217; decisions. There are, of course, statutes also in common-law jurisdictions and previous courts&#8217; decisions play an important role also in civil-law systems. The differences are not inherent. Furthermore, there are fundamental legal concepts, that is important concepts underlying the respective rules. These concepts may explain differences between the rules. The examination of sources of law, altogether, does not reveal any distinguishing factors.Chapters 2&#8211;5 discuss the issue of attitudes of common-law and civil-law judges to statutory interpretation. Chapter 2 examines the respective methods of statutory interpretation. This does not reveal any differences as to common-law and civil-law judges&#8217; attitudes; for instance, greater adherence of common-law judges to the literal meaning of rules arguably does not exist. As shown in Chapter 3, this is true also in the area of Criminal Law under the special safeguards this subject provides. Chapter 4 asserts terminology causes differences between the systems; this is true even in case of identical terminology which is sometimes being interpreted in a diametrically different way. Moreover, differences can also be compensated for elsewhere in the legal system. Altogether, Chapter 4 does not reveal any inherent differences between the systems. As Chapter 5 shows, there is an ongoing process of convergence between common-law and civil-law systems, which means the categorisation into legal families becomes even less plausible.Chapter 6 shows that the categorisation into legal families is not only incorrect but also highly misleading and that there are numerous scholarly statements relying incorrectly on the family concept. The proposition (Chapter 7) is that it may nevertheless be feasible to structure comparative-law texts according to the wellknown legal families, as these show a common historical background. However, for conducting research into particular foreign legal rules (micro-comparative research), the family concept becomes a misleading starting-point. Insofar the concept should be abandoned or, at least, used only together with an appropriate warning.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil law</field><field name="subject">Common law</field><field name="subject">Law (0398)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/landskron</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi sponsored events: should I sponsor if they are?

Results suggest two dimensions primarily determine fit though both are not found together in either event-sponsor or sponsor-sponsor fit. It was also observed that this fit between sponsors did have an effect on brand attitudes and to be stronger than event-sponsor fit.

It attempts to define what we mean by this elusive concept and its relevance to human behaviour. The thesis then develops an operational definition of evil that is distilled from the writings of various social scientists. The thesis argues, however, that in addition to merely defining evil, there are three emotive elements that also go towards our preparedness to label an act as evil. The thesis then examines the causes of evil acts. The thesis argues that the interactive causation, of situation and disposition, is the most robust explanation of evil acts. The thesis rejects the notion of the evil person, instead arguing that it is ordinary people who commit evil acts. The thesis then examines the causes of genocide, the most evil of acts, and links this back to the previous discussion of causal factors of evil acts. Germany&#8217;s war against the Soviet Union in World War II, in particular the role of the Waffen-SS is then discussed. The death and destruction during this conflict would result not just from military operations, but also from the systematic killing and abuse that the Waffen-SS directed against Jews, Communists and ordinary citizens. The thesis then utilises the case study of the Waffen-SS to highlight the application of the interactive causation explanation in regards to evil acts. The conventional wisdom that the Waffen-SS in WWII fought a relatively clean fight, unsullied by the atrocities committed by the Nazis, is challenged&#8212;and largely demolished. Focusing on the Eastern Front, the thesis contends that the Nazi vision of a racial-ideological death struggle against Slavic hordes and their Jewish-Bolshevik commissars resonated with soldiers of the Waffen-SS, steeped in traditional anti-Semitic and racist dogmas. In doing so the thesis clearly shows that the Waffen-SS was an organisation that committed widespread atrocities. The thesis then applies the operational definition of evil to the case study and determines that the acts committed by the Waffen-SS were in fact evil. It also contends that the concept of evil is useful in explaining human atrocity. In conducting this examination the thesis provides some insight into the challenges facing society from preventing future broad-scale acts of evil.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">evil acts</field><field name="subject">genocide</field><field name="subject">Waffen-SS</field><field name="subject">human atrocity</field><field name="subject">Sociology, General (0626)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/6</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secure information flow for inter-organisational collaborative environments</field><field name="creator">Bracher, Shane</field><field name="description">Collaborative environments allow users to share and access data across networks spanning multiple administrative domains and beyond organisational boundaries. This poses several security concerns such as data confidentiality, data privacy and threats to improper data usage. Traditional access control mechanisms focus on centralised systems and implicitly assume that all resources reside in the one domain. This serves as a critical limitation for inter-organisational collaborative environments, which are characteristically decentralised, distributed and heterogeneous.  A consequence of the lack of suitable access control mechanisms for inter-organisational collaborative environments is that data owners relinquish all control over data they release. In these environments, we can reasonably consider more complex cases where documents may have multiple contributors, all with differing access control requirements. Facilitating such cases, as well as maintaining control over the document&#8217;s content, its structure and its flow path as it circulates through multiple administrative domains, is a non-trival issue.  This thesis proposes an architecture model for specifying and enforcing access control restrictions on sensitive data that follows a pre-defined inter-organisational workflow. Our approach is to embed access control enforcement within the workflow object (e.g. the circulating document containing sensitive data) as opposed to relying on each administrative domain to enforce the access control policies. The architecture model achieves this using cryptographic access control &#8211; a concept that relies on cryptography to enforce access control policies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer security</field><field name="subject">Cryptography</field><field name="subject">Computers Access control.</field><field name="subject">Computer Science (0984)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/11</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reordering diplomatic theory for the twenty-first century: a tripartite approach</field><field name="creator">Murray, Stuart</field><field name="description">The central aim of this thesis is to deconstruct and reconstruct the dominant theoretical perceptions of diplomacy, by reworking radically existing theories of diplomacy. This thesis achieves reconceptualisation of diplomatic theory by critiquing the thoughts and ideas of theorists postulating on modern diplomacy. Consequently, this thesis is concerned (largely) with the theoretical terrain of diplomacy studies.The purpose of this intended deconstruction and reconstruction is to introduce and construct three lucid types of diplomatic theory. These three types or categories introduced in this thesis are Traditional, Nascent and Innovative Diplomatic Theory. By categorising these three distinct types of theories, it is hoped that the diplomatic scholar will have a choice of lenses through which to interpret the complexities of the modern diplomatic environment. Ultimately, this thesis aims to strengthen Traditional Diplomatic Theory (TDT) and introduce/construct two alternate forms of diplomatic theory, Nascent Diplomatic Theory (NDT) and Innovative Diplomatic Theory (IDT).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diplomacy</field><field name="subject">Diplomacy Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Political Science, General (0615)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/9</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework for supporting anonymity in text-based online conversations</field><field name="creator">Lee, Andrew</field><field name="description">This research has investigated how anonymity has been achieved in text-based online conversations. It has found that anonymity could be attained without any special provision from a  conversation system. The absence of face-to-face contact and use of typed remarks are sufficient to create anonymity.Nevertheless, the lack of special provisions can make it difficult for some to use the anonymity they have attained. Preserving such naturally attained anonymity can be equally difficult for users. System administrators will also have trouble controlling anonymity without special provisions. Will deliberate provisions for anonymity remove these problems?The goal of this research is to determine how anonymity in online conversations could and should be supported. An existing conversation system lacking in special support for anonymity has been selected. Every possible change for the benefit of anonymity has been made to this system. The changes that have been made and why they were made are described in this thesis. The impact of those changes is also discussed. The final outcome of this research is a set of guidelines and standards for supporting anonymity in text-based online conversations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer security</field><field name="subject">Data protection</field><field name="subject">Cryptography</field><field name="subject">Computer Science (0984)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/lee</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public policy in the judicial enforcement of arbitral awards: lessons for and from Australia</field><field name="creator">Ma, Winnie</field><field name="description">Judicial enforcement of arbitral awards is necessary where there is no voluntary compliance by the relevant parties. Courts world-wide may refuse to enforce arbitral awards if such enforcement would be contrary to the public policy of their countries. This is known as &#8216;the public policy exception to the enforcement of arbitral awards&#8217;. It is enshrined in the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 (New York Convention) and the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration 1985 (Model Law), which are two of the most prominent international instruments in promoting and regulating international commercial arbitration.The public policy exception is one of the most controversial exceptions to the enforcement of arbitral awards, causing judicial inconsistency and therefore unpredictability in its application. It is often likened to an &#8216;unruly horse&#8217;, which may lead us from sound law. The International Law Association&#8217;s Resolution on Public Policy as a Bar to Enforcement of International Arbitral Awards 2002 (ILA Resolution) endorses a narrow approach to the public policy exception &#8211; namely, refusal of enforcement under the public policy exception in exceptional circumstances only. The ILA Resolution seeks to facilitate the finality of arbitral awards in accordance with the New York Convention&#8217;s primary goal of facilitating the enforcement of arbitral awards. The courts of many countries refer to this as the New York Convention&#8217;s &#8216;pro-enforcement policy&#8217;, which demands a narrow approach to the public policy exception.This thesis explores the main controversies and complexities in the judicial application of the public policy exception from an Australian perspective. It is a critical analysis of the prevalent narrow approach to the public policy exception. It examines the extent of the ILA Resolution&#8217;s suitability and applicability in Australia, considering past problems experienced by the courts of other countries, the distinctive features of the Australian legal system, and future challenges confronting the Australian judiciary. It examines when and how the Australian judiciary may need to swim against the tide by departing from the narrow approach to the public policy exception. For instance, such departure may be appropriate for ensuring that their application of the public policy exception neither causes nor condones injustice, and thereby preserves the integrity and faith in the system of arbitration. The author&#8217;s perspective throughout this thesis is that of an academic lawyer, as she has not had the benefit of practical experience in this area of the law.The recommendations throughout this thesis are tailor-made for the Australian judiciary. They are Australian in perspective yet international in character. They canvass certain issues not addressed in the ILA Resolution, encouraging the Australian judiciary to participate in the ongoing debate and the ultimate resolution of those issues. In doing so, this thesis contributes to refining the judicial application of public policy in determining the enforceability of arbitral awards. The public policy exception to the enforcement of arbitral awards, or its application, need not be an unruly horse in Australia.&#8220;This version contains corrections of typographical errors identified in the original version of the thesis submitted for completion of the SJD program&#8221;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arbitration and award Australia</field><field name="subject">Public policy (Law)</field><field name="subject">International arbitration and award</field><field name="subject">Law (0398)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/ma</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utilization of extreme drug resistance testing in malignant melanoma: new is not always better</field><field name="creator">Martens, Kelly</field><field name="description">This research considers the treatment of malignant melanoma. Data were collected from patient records for 78 individuals treated within the Yale Cancer Center Melanoma Unit. The patients were diagnosed with malignant melanoma prior to 1994 and progressed to stage I11 or N disease before their deaths.Due to the rapid progression of malignant melanoma, treatments are initiated at the time of diagnosis. Results of experimental Extreme Drug Resistance (EDR) tests subsequently become available. Physicians are warned the test results are not intended to guide therapy; however, assay directed therapies arguably result in better outcomes with other cancers. Thus, the question arises of whether the use of these tests might benefit patients in this context.This study evaluates the treatment decisions made using a multi-disciplinary approach within the Yale Cancer Center Melanoma Unit regarding patients with malignant melanoma relative to information contained in EDR tests conducted by Oncotech Inc. Within this comparison, three specific outcomes consistent with hypotheses of the study were assessed: the utilization of test results, drug toxicity and cost effectiveness and survival.Results were found to suggest that the initial treatment decisions of the Yale Cancer Center Melanoma Unit were in accord with tests results that were received henceforth for 74 of 78 patients. Two of those patients were in terminal stages of the disease thus treatments were unchanged; however two patients received a change in therapy.It is suggested that physicians made use of the tests as they became available. However, only two patients with therapies altered by the test results were shown to face reduced costs, drug toxicity, or have the benefit of improved survival. From the patient data collected, four patients receiving drugs to which their tumors exhibited EDR were found to exhibit shorter survival times. Literature review studies conducted to evaluate physician treatment approach and patient preference rate favorably the consideration of quality of life issues. The principle finding of this observational study which focuses upon the development of the Yale Cancer Center Melanoma Unit, suggest that a multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of malignant melanoma may offer quality of life benefits to the patient.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Melanoma treatment</field><field name="subject">Melanoma therapy</field><field name="subject">Health Sciences, General (0566)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/martens</field></doc><doc><field name="title">3D Space: special project in advanced computer environments</field><field name="creator">Patterson, Dale</field><field name="description">The primary objective of this research is to use the benefits offered by computerized three dimensional graphics and apply those to the field of human computer interaction. Focussing primarily on the interactive content of the 3D world, this research describes a range of innovative new interface elements demonstrating specific new 3Dinterfaces/components designed to provide a new interactive 3D method for handling a range of particular common real-world tasks (ranging from simple value setting tasks up to larger scale systems for browsing structured sets of hierarchical data). These systems incorporate new design concepts such as active 3D interfaces that present their data to the user rather than statically waiting for the user to interact with them (these systems prove particularly useful in the presentation of large sets of data). Overall this set of components introduces a range of new interface styles that prove very effective in many mainstream real world tasks.In addition to the development of these systems, this project demonstrates a new high level 3D interface development tool designed to simplify the challenge of constructing interactive 3D user interfaces and in doing so make 3D interface development available to a wider developer base. By constructing the components mentioned above in a structured generic form, this combination of a new development tool and a range of re-usable components provide a strong development platform, from which more complex interactive 3D interfaces can be constructed.In essence the core idea that underlies this research is making the construction of interactive and functional 3D interfaces simpler to undertake (by developing effective re-usable components to handle mainstream tasks) while at the same time generating resulting 3D interfaces that are more effective and more capable of providing users with an enjoyable and functional 3D working environment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Graphical user interfaces</field><field name="subject">Human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">Three-dimensional imaging</field><field name="subject">Human engineering</field><field name="subject">Computer Science (0984)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/patterson</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk factors for suicide in adults aged 30-49 : a psychological autopsy study in Hong Kong</field><field name="creator">Wong, Paul Wai-Ching</field><field name="description">The suicide rate in Hong Kong has been increasing since 1997, and the suicide rate among the 30-49-year-olds has increased from 294 in 1996, to 484 in 2003, surging about 65% since 1996. Despite the fact that an increasing trend had been observed, the characteristics of suicides among this age group were not known because no empirical research had been conducted among this age group in Hong Kong. The present study is the first psychological autopsy study conducted on the 30-49 age group in a Chinese society. The aims of this study were to identify and examine the magnitude of the risk factors of middle-aged suicide among the Hong Kong citizens, to determine the similarities and applicability of Western findings into local situation, and to recommend culturally specific evidence-based preventive and intervention strategies. These findings suggest that there are more commonalities than differences in risk factors for suicide found in other psychological autopsy studies; however, the magnitude of some of these identified risk factors were inconsistent with suicide research conducted in other countries. Given the multi-faceted and distinctive nature of middle-age suicide in Hong Kong, a public health approach of suicide prevention strategy, which targets both individuals and the population, is considered to be appropriate than the clinical approach in order to reduce larger population developing greater suicidal risk.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Suicide Hong Kong</field><field name="subject">Suicide Psychological aspects Hong Kong</field><field name="subject">Middle aged persons Hong Kong Suicidal behavior</field><field name="subject">Psychology, Clinical (0622)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/wong</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation and behavioural explanation of family businesser functioning</field><field name="creator">Craig, Justin B</field><field name="description">This research investigated the causes of behavioural difficulties among family businessers in two studies. Study one adapted the evolutionary theory of the firm to the family business context in an empirical study that involved 370 family businessers from 46 families. The study found that: (1) stakeholder cohorts within the family (employed by the business versus not employed by the business; owners of stock versus non stock owners; related to founder versus not related; male versus female) were significantly divided on business direction and planning, the introduction of new routines to the business and various roles, habits, norms and codes that made up the collective knowledge base of the firm; (2) the founding generation reported significantly higher levels of individualism and self-belief than second and third generation family businessers; and (3) the founding generation differed significantly to the third (but not the second) generation on business direction and planning related matters.The second study was a single case design study involving two second-generation family businessers and one third-generation family businesser from three separate family businesses. Using the Skinnerian theory-based technique of functional assessment and the recently formulated Valued Outcomes Analysis (VOA) each individual&#8217;s behaviour was analyzed after an initial interview. From this analysis, causes of behaviour were derived and presented to each participant with suggestions for behaviour change. As a result of adopting the suggestions, each individual reported improved functioning at a second interview conducted after a five-week lapse. It was found that individual functioning in family business could be improved by establishing (1) the function of the behaviour, and (2) the valued outcomes that drive the behaviour.

The current research was designed to investigate the types of written errors ESL teachers corrected and the types of error treatment methods they used to correct those errors in the context of Bond University on the Cold Coast. Moreover, it was intended to highlight the relationship between the literature and actual practice in terms of error treatment of written work. In this study, sixty-six students&#8217; written texts corrected by nine different teachers were collected and examined. The teachers&#8217; treatment of the learner errors found in each sample were identified and classified according to their features. The findings from both quantitative and qualitative data on the patterns of error treatment were analysed, and following this, various comparisons were made. The results of the study indicated that despite the current trend of language teaching, error treatment was frequently provided by the teachers in the ESL classrooms. Moreover, the teachers constantly corrected the deviations of local aspects of the language, which did not seriously influence the intelligibility. In addition, the results of the study also demonstrated that the teachers used both explicit types and implicit types of correction methods in a hybrid manner, and they altered their mode of correction depending on the types of errors. They tended to provide explicit correction for wrong vocabulary and sentence construction errors whereas other surface features, such as grammatical and mechanical errors were generally highlighted with implicit correction, especially with correction codes. The findings of this study suggest that increasing the use of less-time consuming error treatment methods for rule-governed lexical errors and educating learners to be able to carry out self-correction could reduce the teachers&#8217; burden of written error treatment. Moreover, constant information exchange would allow the teachers to revise, refine and change their ways to deal with errors. Until clear effectiveness of certain patterns of error treatment is proven by further studies, these suggestions could be made in order to maximise the benefits of the teachers&#8217; treatment of written errors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language study and teaching evaluation</field><field name="subject">English language written</field><field name="subject">Language, General (0679)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/hashimoto</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiservice traffic allocation in LEO satellite communications</field><field name="creator">Septiawan, Reza</field><field name="description">Satellite communication promises potential methods for providing global communication. In particular, by the development of a Low Earth Orbital (LEO) satellite constellation, both global coverage and broadband communication will be accessible. Problems arise in situations where various traffic types in broadband communication require different levels of quality of service (QoS). Traffic control is required to make sure that each traffic demand may receive the expected QoS. Another problem is that the dynamic topology of a LEO satellite network requires a traffic allocation control, which is able to allocate traffic demand into the Inter Satellite Links (ISLs) between LEO satellites.In this thesis, traffic allocation strategy in a dynamic LEO satellite communication network is studied and analyzed. The delivery of Quality of Service (QoS) is an important objective. Traffic allocation control is performed in the LEO satellite constellation to provide a near optimal utilization of these ISLs. An alternative solution is proposed in this research, in which a combination of two algorithms will be used to allocate traffic in this dynamic satellite network. The first algorithm allocates traffic during small time intervals, based on an assumption that the topology is unchanged during these intervals. The second algorithm allocates traffic after topology updating has been accomplished. Traffic allocation respects some constraints including QoS (due to multiservice requirements), capacity constraints, traffic distribution, and availability constraints. Both theoretical and empirical studies have been undertaken to examine the performance of the proposed algorithm, denoted GALPEDA (Genetic Algorithm Linear Programming and Extended Dijkstra Algorithm). The proposed algorithm provides privileges to a class of high priority traffic, including benefits for traffic allocation of multiclass traffic in LEO satellite communication. It provides a novel traffic allocation mechanism to cope with the dynamic topology of a LEO satellite; moreover this algorithm distributes multiservice traffic evenly over the network.

It creates and follows a well defined methodology for developing and benchmarking trading systems which contain neural networks.Four neural networks and consequently four trading systems are presented within this thesis. The neural networks are trained using all fundamental or all technical variables, and are trained on different segments of the Australian stockmarket, namely all ordinary shares, and the S&amp;P/ASX200 constituents.Three of the four trading systems containing neural networks significantly outperform the respective buy-and-hold returns for their segments of the market, demonstrating that neural networks are suitable for inclusion in stockmarket trading systems.The fourth trading system performs poorly, and a number of reasons are proposed to explain the poor performance. It is significant, however, that the trading system development methodology defined in this thesis clearly exposes the potential failure when testing in-sample, long before the neural network would be used in real trading.Overall, this thesis concludes that neural networks are suitable for use within trading systems, and that trading systems developed using neural networks can be used to provide economically significant profits.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neural networks</field><field name="subject">trading systems</field><field name="subject">finance</field><field name="subject">Computer Science (0984)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/vanstone</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new model for the regulation of complementary and alternative medicine in Australia</field><field name="creator">Weir, Michael</field><field name="description">The fundamental aim of any regulatory system for professional services should be the provision of quality professional services that serve the public interest. The public interest element is paramount to determine what services are regulated and how those services are regulated. This thesis suggests that the current regulatory structure is dominated by the public interest as defined by orthodox medicine (OM). This has skewed the regulatory structure against consumer choices that favour greater reliance upon complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). A postmodernist perspective suggests the need to revisit the current regulatory structure to embrace perspectives on health derived from individuality and personal empiricism free of the modernist outlook characteristic of OM.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alternative medicine</field><field name="subject">Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Medical care</field><field name="subject">Law (0398)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/weir</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of earnings management on the value-relevance of earnings and book value: a comparison of short-term and long-term discretionary accruals</field><field name="creator">Whelan, Catherine</field><field name="description">Earnings and book value are commonly used as the basis for firm valuation. However, the reliability of earnings, as indicated by earnings management, may affect its relevance in determining firm value. This thesis investigates the link between earnings management and firm valuation by assessing the impact of earnings management on the value-relevance of earnings and book value.Three different sources of earnings management are investigated: total discretionary accruals, short-term discretionary accruals, and long-term discretionary accruals. Total discretionary accruals are estimated using the Jones model (Jones 1991). New models are developed to estimate short-term and long-term discretionary accruals. These models enable investigation of the differential impact of earnings management via short-term versus earnings management via long-term discretionary accruals. The primary proposition is that earnings management via long-term discretionary accruals has a greater impact on the value-relevance of earnings and book value than earnings management via short-term discretionary accruals.For firm&#8217;s whose discretionary accruals indicate earnings management, the value relevance of earnings is expected to be lower than for firms without earnings management. Moreover, in the presence of earnings management, it is expected that there will be a shift from a reliance on earnings to a reliance on book value in the valuation process. This would be reflected in a decrease in the value-relevance of earnings and an increase in the value-relevance of book value.This thesis provides evidence that earnings management plays a role in the valuation process. A major contribution of this study is the development of models to enable the estimation of short-term and long-term discretionary accruals, thereby extending the earnings management literature by addressing the differential effect of short-term versus long-term discretionary accruals. The results clearly demonstrate that low reliability of information reduces its value-relevance. This link between the integrity of accounting information and its usefulness to market participants supports the need for ongoing regulatory activity to improve the integrity of the financial reporting process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Discretionary income</field><field name="subject">discretionary trusts</field><field name="subject">earnings management</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Accounting (0272)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/whelan</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Money supply endogeneity and bank stock returns: empirical evidence from the G-7 countries</field><field name="creator">Badarudin, Zatul E</field><field name="description">This thesis is about (a) money supply being determined by banking behaviour, or by the behaviour of central banks and (b) the influence of money supply on bank stock returns.

From a Leninist authoritarian system, Taiwan experienced a peaceful transition to representative democracy. The establishment of the first opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), in 1986, and President Chiang Ching-kuo&#8217;s tolerance towards it, had signalled the commencement of Taiwan&#8217;s democratization. Various political opposition movements existed prior to 1986, especially between 1983 and 1986, indicating a gradual strengthening in the public&#8217;s political consciousness. The pivotal event to mark the democratization-localization movement in Taiwan was the emergence of a local Taiwanese, Lee Teng-hui, as President of the Republic of China and Chairman of the ruling party, the Chungkuo Kuomintang (KMT). This occurred when he succeeded Chiang Ching-kuo upon his death in 1988. Local politics henceforth emerged as a major force and KMT factional struggles had begun in earnest. During the democratic transformation that took place in Taiwan in the last quarter of the 20th century, the ruling power of the Waishengren political elite (that is, the Chinese who took over Taiwan in 1945) gradually transferred to local political leaders, and the suppressed issue of building an independent Taiwanese nation became politicized. Furthermore, the KMT itself was undergoing a far-reaching transformation, moving from liberalization, to democratization, to localization or Taiwanization. As a result, the issues of national recognition and the power redistribution of different national groups (from Chinese &#8220;Mainlanders&#8221; to local Taiwanese) had combined with democratization from the beginning. Democratization was assisted by institution-building through regular elections, an associated critical voice from opposition groups, a solid middle class, and the Taiwanization phenomenon itself. While the experience of colonial rule and an oppressive (rather than reformist) KMT may be said to be in the past, and hence less an impetus for action in the present, yet with the addition of a persistent military threat from People&#8217;s Republic of China seeking  Taiwan&#8217;s &#8220;reunification&#8221; with the &#8220;motherland&#8221;, past, present and an anticipated future, combine contextually in the quest for Taiwan&#8217;s integrity &#8211; and hence the acquisition of an identity that is consciously Taiwanese rather than Chinese by default.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Taiwan democracy</field><field name="subject">Taiwan Politics and government</field><field name="subject">Lee Teng-hui</field><field name="subject">Political Science, General (0615)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/ching-ni</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative analysis of the corporate governance legislative frameworks in Australia and Jordan measured against the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance 2004 as an international benchmark</field><field name="creator">Sharar, Zain</field><field name="description">In recent years, countries across the globe have come to realise the importance of an official corporate governance regime, which provides a platform for market integrity and efficiency, as well as facilitating economic growth. Formulating effective corporate governance measures is a complex task for legislators. The purpose of this paper is to provide an in depth analysis and comparison of the corporate governance legislative frameworks in Australia and Jordan. In 2004, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in conjunction with national and international governmental organisations, finalised a universal set of corporate governance principles. Although non-binding, the OECD Principles 2004 are a serious attempt to strengthen every aspect of corporate governance and, accordingly, have been utilised in this paper as an international benchmark.The ultimate objective of this paper is to formulate a number of detailed and specific recommendations to the Jordanian Government. Jordan&#8217;s legislative framework for corporations received a significant shake-up a decade ago when the Jordanian Government began the process of implementing a privatisation program under the guidance of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Despite a number of positive developments since this program was initiated, the Jordanian Government has continually failed to recognise the importance of promoting good corporate governance. There can be no doubt that the Jordanian companies&#8217; legislation is in desperate need of reform. The vast majority of the provisions are ambiguous and lack the necessary detail to regulate the complex sphere of company law. In this writer&#8217;s opinion, the relevant authorities in Jordan must act immediately to bring the country&#8217;s legislative regime into line with internationally recognised standards and practices. Chapter 1 of the paper sets out an introductory explanation of corporate governance and corporate structure. Chapter 2 provides a brief account of the history of company law in Jordan and a description of the different types of company structures permitted under the relevant Jordanian legislation. Chapter 3 provides a detailed discussion of the corporate governance principles formulated by the OECD. The process began in 1999 and was completed in 2004 after extensive revision and consultation. Chapter 4, the core part of the paper, presents a comparative analysis of the implementation of the OECD principles in Australia and Jordan. Chapter 5 provides an explanation and analysis of two important shareholders&#8217; remedies in the Australian companies&#8217; legislation that do not exist in Jordan. Finally, Chapter 6 provides a summary of analysis and sets out a list of recommendations to the Jordanian Government.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate governance Jordan</field><field name="subject">Corporate governance Australia</field><field name="subject">Law (0398)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/sharar</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A flexible framework for leveraging verification tools to enhance the verification technologies available for policy enforcement</field><field name="creator">Larkin, James</field><field name="description">Program verification is vital as more and more users are creating, downloading and executing foreign computer programs. Software verification tools provide a means for determining if a program adheres to a user&#8217;s security requirements, or security policy. There are many verification tools that exist for checking different types of policies on different types of programs. Currently however, there is no verification tool capable of determining if all types of programs satisfy all types of policies. This thesis describes a framework for supporting multiple verification tools to determine program satisfaction. A user&#8217;s security requirements are represented at multiple levels of abstraction as Intermediate Execution Environments. Using a sequence of configurations, a user&#8217;s security requirements are transformed from the abstract level to the tool level, possibly for multiple verification tools.

Society is becoming increasingly reliant on ubiquitous computing, where mobile devices play a key role. The use of wireless networking is a natural solution to providing connectivity for such devices. However, the availability of infrastructure in wireless networks is often limited. Such networks become dependent on wireless ad hoc networking, where nodes communicate and form paths of communication themselves. Wireless ad hoc networks present novel challenges in contrast to fixed infrastructure networks. The unpredictability of node movement and route availability become issues of significant importance where reliability is desired.To improve reliability in wireless ad hoc networks, predicting future connectivity between mobile devices has been proposed. Predicting connectivity can be employed in a variety of routing protocols to improve route stability and reduce unexpected drop-offs of communication. Previous research in this field has been limited, with few proposals for generating future predictions for mobile nodes. Further work in this field is required to gain a better insight into the effectiveness of various solutions.This thesis proposes such a solution to increase reliability in wireless ad hoc routing. This research presents two novel concepts to achieve this: the Communication Map (CM), and the Future Neighbours Table (FNT). The CM is a signal loss mapping solution. Signal loss maps delineate wireless signal propagation capabilities over physical space. With such a map, connectivity predictions are based on signal capabilities in the environment in which mobile nodes are deployed. This significantly improves accuracy of predictions in this and in previous research. Without such a map available, connectivity predictions have no knowledge of realistic spatial transmission ranges. The FNT is a solution to provide routing algorithms with a predicted list of future periods of connectivity between all nodes in an established wireless ad hoc network. The availability of this information allows route selection in routing protocols to be greatly improved, benefiting connectivity. The FNT is generated from future node positional information combined with the CM to provide predicted signal loss estimations at future intervals. Given acceptable signal loss values, the FNT is constructed as a list of periods of time in which the signal loss between pairs of nodes will rise above or fall below this acceptable value (predicted connectivity). Future node position information is ideally found in automated networks. Robotic nodes commonly operate where future node task movement is developed and planned into the future, ideal for use in predicted connectivity. Non-automated prediction is also possible, as there exist some situations where travel paths can be predictable, such as mobile users on a train or driving on a highway. Where future node movement is available, predictions of connectivity between nodes are possible.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless LANs</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Mobile computing</field><field name="subject">Computer Science (0984)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/larkin</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The value relevance of enterprise resource planning information</field><field name="creator">Wickramasinghe, Jayantha</field><field name="description">The value of information technology investments is becoming a topical issue for corporate governance under the recent regulations enacted in the US (Sarbanes Oxley Act, US Congress, 2002). Increasingly, it is becoming clear that the absence of a definitive approach to evaluating IT investments is an impediment to the governance of corporations. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) information systems are a key IT implementation that has been promoted in both vendor and practitioner communities alike as a panacea for informed enterprise performance management. This research sets out a methodology for the evaluation of ERP&#8217;s contribution to enterprise value. This issue is important because billions of dollars of corporate funds have been invested in these systems since the early 1990s. Shareholders and management require a justification of ERP based upon its proven contribution to enterprise and shareholder value.The study develops a theory for the value relevance of ERP information by showing how ERP meets the requirement of a management and organizational innovation. Such an innovation promotes enterprise operations, improves enterprise performance, supports value creation, and increases shareholder wealth. A model is presented for testing the value of ERP adoption. Empirical testing proceeds in two phases. The first phase develops a model for forecasting normal performance. Performance is shown to be a function of autoregressive earnings moderated by macroeconomic factors impacting operations. The latter are associated with the business cycle. The estimated coefficients of the model are used for predicting the earnings performance of the firm. The residuals of actual earnings less the predicted represent abnormal performance. This represents the unique improvement in performance over the prior year after adjusting for macroeconomic effects. The second phase tests the value relevance of ERP information. A returns&#8211;earnings model developed by previous research is adapted with ERP&#8211;earnings interaction terms representing the ERP system&#8217;s effect on performance. Two classes of tests are performed on the model: tests of performance relevance of ERP systems, and tests of value relevance. The former tests ERP performance across several accounting metrics identified as indicators of firm performance level change. The latter tests the market response to these changes in a bid to determine if, in the perception of the market, the changes in the performance level attained to by the firm are associated with ERP adoption. These tests are performed for each year of a 5&#8211;year period following adoption. The results of the tests of performance relevance show that ERP&#8211;adopter firms do not achieve significant abnormal earnings in years 1 and 2 of the test period. They realize significant, negative, abnormal earnings in year 3. In years 4 and 5, they attain significant, positive, abnormal earnings. The tests of value relevance show that the market responds significantly to ERP adoption in year 2 of the test, but not in other years. The early response immediately after the year of adoption would seem to indicate a significant early expectation from these systems. However, this does appear to translate into long&#8211;term value relevance for ERP.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Management information systems</field><field name="subject">Business planning</field><field name="subject">Enterprise resource planning (ERP)</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, General (0310)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/wickramasinghe</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internet censorship offending : a preliminary analysis of the social and behavioural patterns of offenders</field><field name="creator">Carr, Angela</field><field name="description">During the past decade, significant public concern has focused on the use of the Internet to access child pornography and other legally objectionable material. Media reference to individuals involved in such activity typically portrays them as socially isolated &#8216;paedophiles&#8217;, &#8216;perverts&#8217; and &#8216;sexual predators&#8217; whose offence behaviour is encouraged by on-line associations with others who share their interest in this material. Although academic literature does not tend to adhere to the sensationalism of these views, it too suggests that on-line networks may be important in understanding the behaviour of individuals who seek to gratify an interest in legally objectionable material.A major aim of this thesis was to examine the relationship between involvement in Internet based social activity and involvement in accessing legally objectionable material via the Internet. As such, data collected during the investigation of a sample of 145 individuals identified as using the Internet to access legally objectionable material was subjected to a series of explorative analyses. These analyses revealed significant associations between individuals&#8217; use of Internet applications facilitating directed, two way communication (eg. Email and ICQ) during the process of accessing legally objectionable material and indicators of increased personal investment in offence related activities.A second goal of this thesis was to identify variables associated with offenders&#8217; decisions to engage in on-line social interaction during the process of accessing legally objectionable material. In turn, criminological and communications theory and research pertaining to the interpersonal behaviours that individuals engage in during criminal actions, and the characteristics of individuals who make use of socially facilitative Internet applications, was reviewed. Based on the findings of this review, it was hypothesised that offenders who engage in regular interaction with others outside of the Internet environment would be more likely than those who did not to seek out opportunities for interaction in the Internet environment. In line with this hypothesis, further systematic and detailed analysis of the data revealed an association between opportunities for interpersonal interaction in an offender&#8217;s home or work environment and the likelihood that offenders would make use of Internet applications facilitating online social interaction.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet and children</field><field name="subject">Internet pornography</field><field name="subject">Sex offenders</field><field name="subject">Pedophilia</field><field name="subject">Social Work (0452)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/carr</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Criminal Profiling : a Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Process and Content</field><field name="creator">Petherick, Wayne</field><field name="description">This research examines the content and process involved in developing criminal profiles. To assess the material typically included in profiles and the way that the conclusions are developed, a qualitative analysis of the content of profiles was undertaken. This included, among other things, the characteristics offered, their prevalence, and the most common characteristics by profiling method. A further quantitative study was undertaken employing Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) which revealed three general themes in the advice given. These included Crime Scene, Internal Offender and Offender Characteristic facets, each of which was comprised of features suggestive of that facet. For example, the Crime Scene facet typically described offender actions and their interpretation at the physical location of the criminal event, such as staging and methods of control.The study employed a sample of 49 profilers reflective of the four main schools of thought; Criminal Investigative Analysis (CIA), Investigative Psychology (IP), Diagnostic Evaluations (DE) and Behavioural Evidence Analysis (BEA). CIA profiles were greatest in number with a sample size of 19. There were 14 BEA profiles and 8 each of DE and IP profiles. Together, there were in excess of 3000 individual variables ranging from age, sex and race to employment, geography, mental illness and risk.Results indicate that the vast majority of profilers employ either research or personal belief in forming their opinions, and that physical evidence is used the least in justifying a profiler&#8217;s opinion. However, when considering the individual methods, BEA placed the greatest reliance on physical evidence and its interpretation according with the forensic science philosophy of the method. CIA, the method used by the FBI, produced the most characteristics of the sample at 312 across 19 profiles, followed by BEA at 166 characteristics across 14 profiles. IP and DE profiles, with a sample size of eight each, had 90 and 61 characteristics respectively.Beyond these findings, the implication of the research will be discussed and some future direction for this research and the field in general will be provided. These areas include education, training, the scientific method and professionalisation. This thesis will also canvass the issue of whether profiling is an art or a science with particular reference to the research results and the existing literature that has bothered to address this issue.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Criminal behavior, Prediction of</field><field name="subject">Criminal investigation</field><field name="subject">Criminal methods Research Methodology.</field><field name="subject">Sociology, Criminology and Penology (0627)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/2</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Putting the storytelling back into stories : creative non-fiction in tertiary journalism education</field><field name="creator">Blair, Molly</field><field name="description">This work explores the place of creative non-fiction in Australian tertiary journalism education. While creative non-fiction &#8212; a genre of writing based on the techniques of the fiction writer &#8212; has had a rocky relationship with journalism, this study shows that not only is there a place for the genre in journalism education, but that it is inextricably linked with journalism. The research is based on results from studies using elite interviews and a census of Australian universities with practical journalism curricula. The first stage of this study provides a definition of creative non-fiction based on the literature and a series of elite interviews held with American and Australian creative non-fiction experts. This definition acknowledges creative non-fiction as a genre of writing that tells true stories while utilising fiction writing techniques such as point of view, dialogue and vivid description. The definition also takes into account creative non-fiction&#8217;s diverse range of publication styles which include feature articles, memoir, biography, literary journalism and narrative non-fiction. The second stage of the study reports upon elite interviews with Australian writers who have produced works in the genres of journalism and creative non-fiction. These interviews reveal the close relationship journalism and creative non-fiction share across a variety of approaches and techniques. This study also shows how creative non-fiction can improve the careers of journalists and the quality of journalism. The census of journalism programs further reveals the place of creative non-fiction in tertiary journalism education and prompts the formulation of a two tiered model for the genre&#8217;s inclusion in the curriculum. The first tier involves including creative non-fiction in a core journalism subject. The second tier is an elective creative non-fiction subject which builds on the skills developed in the core classes. Through the literature, and the responses of the elites and survey respondents, it was possible to show how creative non-fiction helps journalism students to appreciate the history of their profession, explore their talents and finally to be part of what may be the future of print journalism.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative writing Study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Non-fiction Authorship</field><field name="subject">Non-fictionTechnique</field><field name="subject">Journalism (0391)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/blair</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The regulation of the franchise relationship in Australia :a contractual analysis</field><field name="creator">Spencer, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines whether the regulation of the franchise sector is effective in achieving two of the stated goals of the Franchising Code of Conduct. These two goals are redressing the imbalance of power in the relationship and increasing levels of certainty for participants in the sector. Based on the &#8216;new learning&#8217; in regulation, this dissertation takes an expansive approach to the concept of regulation. It considers how, in a &#8216;multi-layered system of governance&#8217;, the layers of regulation of the franchising sector contribute to these goals. The results of the analysis suggest that private, self-regulation through the layers of market and contract sets up a relationship where there is an imbalance of power in favour of a franchisor and uncertainty for a franchisee. The market interaction between the parties establishes these conditions, which are reinforced by the contract, in particular by the interaction of the standard form and relational qualities of the contract. A public layer of governance, direct intervention in the form of the Franchising Code of Conduct, relies largely on selfregulatory tools such as disclosure and is also ineffective in addressing the imbalance of power in the relationship and in increasing levels of certainty for franchisees. Because neither self-regulatory mechanisms nor legislative intervention achieves the stated goals of redressing imbalance of power and uncertainty in the franchise relationship, the analysis concludes that a reframing of regulation is necessary. The recommended revised regulatory program features collaborative, participative, democratic process to gather and assess good measurements that inform the identification of problems and the selection of tools appropriate to address those problems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Franchises (Retail trade) Law and legislation Australia</field><field name="subject">Franchising (Retail trade)</field><field name="subject">Law (0398)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/spencer</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perfecting the Chinese law of trusts: critical and comparative study of the Australian and Chinese law of trusts</field><field name="creator">Tan, Zhenting</field><field name="description">The rapid expansion of the Chinese economy has made China aware if the importance of the rule by law. Perfecting its legal system and expanding its economy are the two goals of modern China. Many laws and regulations have been enacted since the economic reform was launched at the end of 1970s. The enactment of the Chinese Law of Trusts is an important step in the refinement of the Chinese legal system.This thesis aims to identify the deficiencies in the Chinese Law of Trusts by giving a critical and comparative study of the Australian and the Chinese trusts law, so as to propose amendments to the Chinese Law of Trusts. This thesis is divided into two Parts, and seven Chapters. Part One, which comprises five chapters, is a comparative study of the Australian and the Chinese trusts law. It also discusses the laws of trusts in other important Common Law and Civil Law jurisdictions. Chapter 1 of this Part deals with the basic concept of the trust. It introduces and discusses the definition, and the characteristics of the trust, the comparison between the trust and other similar concepts, and the classification of trusts. Chapter 2 deals with the creation of express trusts. With respect to the rights and duties of the trust parties, Chapter 3 gives a detailed discussion. Chapter 4 examines the variation and termination of trusts. The last chapter of Part One, Chapter 5, specifically analyses the charitable trusts.Part Two comprises two chapters: Chapter 6 and Chapter 7. Chapter 6 discusses the practical impact of the Chinese Law of Trusts on the Chinese State-owned enterprise reform, which has been progressing for more than two decades in China. Chapter 7 is a general concluding chapter. It pinpoints the deficiencies in the Chinese Law of Trusts, analyses the reasons for the deficiencies, and suggests two solutions to improve the Law: namely, to improve the existing provisions of the Law and to adopt eclectically the elaborate concepts of the Australian law of trusts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trusts and trustees China</field><field name="subject">Trusts and trustees Australia</field><field name="subject">Law of Trusts</field><field name="subject">Law (0398)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/tan</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand migrants to Australia :social construction of migrant identity</field><field name="creator">Green, Alison E.</field><field name="description">New Zealanders&#8217; motivations for migrating to Australia and the effect of migration on their cultural and national identity were examined through analysis of interviews and surveys with New Zealand migrants and stayers. Factors influencing the move included economic pull factors, lifestyle factors, family reunification, some dissatisfaction with New Zealand society, the desire for a change, and a sense of adventure. Participants reported a high level of satisfaction with their new lives in Australia, and once resident there, initial motivating reasons merged with factors which reinforced and justified the decision to move. These included the benefits of a warmer climate, the perception that Australia was a more relaxed and tolerant society, and the belief by Maori that living in Australia freed them from negative stereotypes.New Zealand migrants to Australia revised their identity in light of their new experiences, and yet continued to view New Zealand positively, retaining aspects of their New Zealand identity as part of their ongoing evolving identity. However, while feeling at home in both countries, as time went on many migrants adopted a more Australian identity. Over time, they considered Australia was superior in a number of respects, and adapted and changed in response to Australian influences. Despite this, migrants maintained the boundary between New Zealand and Australian characteristics through a process of constant comparisons and, somewhat ambivalently, retained their strong positive regard for New Zealand. In the main, participants considered they could be happy in either country, but were happier in Australia. Migrants constructed positive reasons to justify their move and viewed themselves as adventurous and determined, while stayers constructed equally positive reasons for staying in New Zealand, seeing themselves as settled and stable.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand Emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Australia Emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Sociology, Demography (0938)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/1</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Backward bifurcation in SIR endemic models : this thesis is presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Information Science in Mathematics at Massey University, Albany, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siddiqui, Sameeha Qaiser</field><field name="description">In the well known SIR endemic model, the infection-free steady state is globally stable for R0 &lt; 1 and unstable for R0 &gt; 1. Hence, we have a forward bifurcation when R0 = 1. When R0 &gt; 1, an asymptotically stable endemic steady state exists. The basic reproduction number R0 is the main threshold bifurcation parameter used to determine the stability of steady states of SIR endemic models. In this thesis we study extensions of the SIR endemic model for which a backward bifurcation may occur at R0 = 1. We investigate the biologically reasonable conditions for the change of stability. We also analyse the impact of di erent factors that lead to a backward bifurcation both numerically and analytically. A backward bifurcation leads to sub-critical endemic steady states and hysteresis. We also provide a general classi cation of such models, using a small amplitude expansion near the bifurcation. Additionally, we present a procedure for projecting three dimensional models onto two dimensional models by applying some linear algebraic techniques. The four extensions examined are: the SIR model with a susceptible recovered class; nonlinear transmission; exogenous infection; and with a carrier class. Numerous writers have mentioned that a nonlinear transmission function in relation to the infective class, can only lead to a system with an unstable endemic steady state. In spite of this we show that in a nonlinear transmission model, we have a function depending on the infectives and satisfying certain biological conditions, and leading to a sub-critical endemic equilibriums.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematical biology</field><field name="subject">linear algebra</field><field name="subject">nonlinear transmission</field><field name="subject">exogenous infection</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the most recent prior period's price in value relevance studies : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Finance at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Senthilnathan, Samithamby</field><field name="description">Numerous value relevance investigations use the Ohlson (1995) model to empirically explore the value relevance of accounting variables such as earnings and goodwill amortisation by employing equity price as the dependent variable, but do not incorporate the most recent prior period&#8217;s equity price as an additional explanatory variable. The Ohlson (1995) model and the efficient market literature indicate that, since share prices represent the present value of future permanent earnings in an efficient market, the most recent prior period&#8217;s equity price should be a crucial variable for explaining the current price in value relevance models. This thesis therefore outlines how the Ohlson (1995) model incorporates the most recent prior period&#8217;s price as a potentially important value relevant explanatory variable, and reformulates the Ohlson (1995) model to demonstrate how the empirical specification of value relevance regression models can be greatly improved by including the most recent prior period&#8217;s price as an additional explanatory variable. We revisit the Jennings, LeClere, and Thompson (2001) empirical specification used to study whether goodwill amortisation is value relevant and potentially informative with respect to future earnings to illustrate the improvement to the Ohlson (1995) value relevance model empirical specification. When the model specification is improved by including the most recent prior period&#8217;s price as an additional explanatory variable, trailing earnings are shown, using time series, cross-sectional, and returns-based analysis, to be at best marginally value relevant when empirically explaining share prices in value relevance regression models. The thesis also indicates that goodwill amortisation should not be deducted from earnings in accounting statements because the presence of goodwill amortisation is significantly positively (not negatively) related to equity prices. This effect is eliminated when the most recent prior period&#8217;s price is included as an additional explanatory variable in the regression analysis, thus indicating that goodwill amortisation information as well as trailing earnings information have already been incorporated into the most recent prior period&#8217;s price. The thesis further indicates that value relevance studies that use the Ohlson (1995) model should use, for econometric reasons, change in price or else returns, not the price level, as the dependent variable. When returns are used to test the value relevance of goodwill amortisation, firms that report positive goodwill amortization actually have higher subsequent returns, a result that could possibly be due to the fact that growing firms tend to possess goodwill when they use acquisitions to expand. Results obtained when using returns to test whether goodwill amortisation is value relevant therefore extend the existing literature, since the prevailing expectation in the accounting literature is that goodwill amortization either represents a reduction in the value of goodwill over time or is not value relevant.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">share prices</field><field name="subject">goodwill amortisation</field><field name="subject">Ohlson model</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350300 Banking, Finance and Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some applications of statistical phylogenetics : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biomathematics at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Schliep, Klaus Peter</field><field name="description">The increasing availability of molecular data means that phylogenetic studies nowadays often use datasets which combine a large number of loci for many different species. This leads to a trade-off. On the one hand more complex models are preferred to account for heterogeneity in evolutionary processes. On the other hand simple models that can answer biological questions of interest that are easy to interpret and can be computed in reasonable time are favoured. This thesis focuses on four cases of phylogenetic analysis which arise from this conflict. - It is shown that edge weight estimates can be non-identifiable if the data are simulated under a mixture model. Even if the underlying process is known the estimation and interpretation may be difficult due to the high variance of the parameters of interest. - Partition models are commonly used to account for heterogeneity in data sets. Novel methods are presented here which allow grouping of genes under similar evolutionary constraints. A data set, containing 14 genes of the chloroplast from 19 anciently diverged species is used to find groups of co-evolving genes. The prospects and limitations of such methods are discussed. - Penalised likelihood estimation is a useful tool for improving the performance of models and allowing for variable selection. A novel approach is presented that uses pairwise dissimilarities to visualise the data as a network. It is further shown how penalised likelihood can be used to decrease the variance of parameter estimates for mixture and partition models, allowing a more reliable analysis. Estimates for the variance and the expected number of parameters of penalised likelihood estimates are derived. - Tree shape statistics are used to describe speciation events in macroevolution. A new tree shape statistic is introduced and the biases of different cluster methods on tree shape statistics are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">datasets</field><field name="subject">partition model</field><field name="subject">penalised likelihood</field><field name="subject">tree shape statistic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::239900 Other Mathematical Sciences::239901 Biological Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/931</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Participatory development: methods, skills and processes; a design framed action research thesis</field><field name="creator">Butcher, Martin</field><field name="description">The research question that forms the body of this thesis is: &#8216;What methods, skills and processes does the participatory development practitioner require for effective practice?&#8217;The intention behind this research topic has been to identify how to create socially relevant spaces within todays contemporary conditions of society. This is a reflection of an understanding of myself as someone within the &#8216;idealist&#8217; stream of endeavour as defined by Charles Jencks in &#8216;Modern Movements in Architecture.&#8217;As I have a design background, I chose a design methodology to undertake the study. The methodology is documented by Donald Sch&#246;n in the book &#8216;The Reflective Practitioner&#8217; and is, in a general sense, also the methodology David Kolb documented in &#8216;Experiential Learning: Experience as the Source of Learning and Development&#8217;. An element of this learning approach is for a designer to create a useful artefact that can be considered and evaluated, thus the thesis also comprises the DVD: &#8216;Outside the Gates, Development Processes for the Real World&#8217;.In writing the thesis I became aware that this learning process has been, and still is, central to development itself within our culture of generative change. I first arrived at this intuitively while building the DVD, but it became more explicit during the DVD evaluation. The thesis thus commences with a description and rationale for the methodology.After describing the methodology I devote three chapters to providing the background to both the form and content of the DVD. This draws almost exclusively from personal experience, though with references to architectural history, theory and practice. This includes observations on the theme of technological development, generative change and one of the real needs for our physical and psychological well being - shelter. Thus the DVD sits at a mid point in the thesis. Following the creation of the DVD, I have in accordance with the methodology evaluated its content. To do this I used a literature review generally based on Grounded Theory practice. There are four sections in the DVD, with a chapter dedicated to each of these sections.The thesis concludes with a chapter that fits in the final part of Kolb&#8217;s learning cycle, abstract conceptualisation, that considers the meaning of the findings. Ultimately there is an epilogue that outlines the next &#8216;concrete output&#8217;, a recently completed project based on the learnings from the thesis. This is a community engagement training course for project managers.[To view the content of the DVD: Outside the gates go to http://www.martinbutcher.com/Site/OtG.html]</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">paticipation</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">stakeholder</field><field name="subject">group</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">empowerment</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">choice</field><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/77</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polydora and Dipolydora (Polychaeta: Spionidae) of estuaries and bays of subtropical eastern Australia: A review and morphometric investigation of their taxonomy and distribution</field><field name="creator">Walker, Lexie Margaret</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to review the current state of knowledge, occurrence and distribution of two polydorid (Polychaeta: Spionidae) genera, Polydora and Dipolydora, in estuaries of subtropical eastern Australia. The existing taxonomy of the polydorid group is confused and descriptions include many relative terms. A numerical taxonomy approach using Primer 6 was taken to identify species groups and characters. A standardized set of multivariate morphological characters was developed and resemblance analysis functions used to create species cluster groups. SIMPER (similarity percentages) analysis on the same dataset was used to identify the diagnostic characters for each of these species cluster groups and to identify new characters which could be useful in species diagnosis, particularly for frequently occurring incomplete specimens.Prior to this study 3 Polydora species and 4 Dipolydora species were recorded from subtropical eastern Australia. The present study found 12 Polydora species and 10 Dipolydora species from estuaries and bays of subtropical eastern Australia.Two Polydora species are new (Polydora sp. P1 and Polydora cf. woodwicki) and 7 are potentially new species (P. cf. latispinosa; P. cf. websteri; P. sp. P2S; P. sp. P3S; P. sp. P4S; P. sp. P5S and P. sp. P6S) having been described from single specimens. Polydora cornuta Bosc, 1902 is recorded from New South Wales for the first time. Polydora cf. calcarea is reported from mudblisters in oysters. The Australian form of Polydora hoplura Clapar&#232;de, 1870 and P. haswelli Blake and Kudenov, 1978 are described more fully than in existing literature.Three Dipolydora species are new (Dipolydora sp. D1; D. cf. flava and D. sp. D2) and 4 from single specimens are potentially new (D. cf. aciculata/ cf. giardi; D. sp. D3S; D. sp. D4S and D. sp. D5S). Dipolydora tentaculata (Blake and Kudenov, 1978) and Australian forms of Dipolydora flava (Clapar&#232;de, 1870) and Dipolydora socialis (Schmarda, 1861) are described more fully than in existing literature.Prior to this study one Dipolydora and no Polydora were recorded from the Tweed- Moreton bioregion. This study reports 6 species of Dipolydora and 5 species of Polydora from this bioregion.Dipolydora penicillata (Hutchings and Rainer, 1979) and Carazziella victoriensis Blake and Kudenov, 1978 are recommended for synonymy.It is recommended that Polydora ciliata (Johnston, 1838) be reinstated and Dipolydora ciliata (Johnson, 1838) removed from the Australian polychaete checklist following identification of an error in description translation.Important gaps in collections were identified for polydorids associated with oysters from estuaries over the whole subtropical region; and for polydorids from the Tweed-Moreton IMCRA bioregion.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spionidae</field><field name="subject">polydorid</field><field name="subject">subtropical</field><field name="subject">numerical taxonomy</field><field name="subject">polychaete</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">review</field><field name="subject">Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/92</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of the gene responsible for fragrance in rice and characterisation of the enzyme transcribed from this gene and its homologs</field><field name="creator">Bradbury, Louis MT</field><field name="description">The flavour or fragrance of Basmati rice is associated with the presence of 2-acetyl-1- pyrroline. This work shows that a gene with homology to betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BAD) has significant polymorphisms in the coding region of fragrant genotypes relative to non fragrant genotypes. Accumulation of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline in fragrant rice genotypes may be explained by the presence of mutations resulting in loss of function of the fgr gene product. The fgr gene corresponds to the gene encoding BAD2 in rice while BAD1 is encoded by a gene on chromosome 4. Development of an allele specific amplification (ASA) based around the deletion in the gene encoding BAD2 allows, perfect, simple and low cost discrimination between fragrant and non-fragrant rice varieties and identifies homozygous fragrant, homozygous non-fragrant and heterozygous non-fragrant individuals in a population segregating for fragrance. The cDNAs transcribed from rice chromosomes 4 and 8, each encoding an enzyme with homology to betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase were cloned and expressed in E. coli. The enzyme responsible for fragrance, encoded from chromosome 8, had optimum activity at pH 10, showed low affinity towards betaine aldehyde (bet-ald) with Km value of approximately 63&#236;M but a higher affinity towards -aminobutyraldehyde (GABald) with a Km value of approximately 9&#236;M. The enzyme encoded from chromosome 4 had optimum activity at pH 9.5 and showed generally lower affinity towards most substrates compared to the enzyme encoded from chromosome 8, substrate specificities suggest that the enzymes have higher specificity to aminoaldehydes and as such both should be renamed as an aminoaldehyde dehydrogenase (AAD). The inactivation of AAD2 (BAD2) in fragrant rice varieties likely leads to accumulation of its main substrate GABald which then cyclises to 1-pyrroline the immediate precursor of 2AP.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">2-acetyl-1- pyrroline</field><field name="subject">jasmine rice</field><field name="subject">basmati</field><field name="subject">rice</field><field name="subject">fragrance</field><field name="subject">aroma</field><field name="subject">betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase</field><field name="subject">amino aldehyde dehydrogenase</field><field name="subject">Plant Breeding and Genetics</field><field name="subject">Plant Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/91</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of the project management body of knowledge and practice for urban renewal project implementation in Hong Kong special administrative region, China</field><field name="creator">Mui, Dennis Heung-Fu</field><field name="description">The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is faced with the rapid rate of urban deterioration. With the unique and densely populated nature of the city, the road to urban revitalisation can be envisaged to be a long and painful one. The government is determined to expedite the urban renewal work by establishing of the Urban Renewal Authority in May 2001 to replace Land Development Corporation that was established in 1988 to tackle the issue. The new set up is to operate with more public accountability and transparency as demanded by the community at large. It is also commissioned with the task of completing 225 projects in the next 25 years involving an estimated cost of over A$75 billion. The government has also decided to make Hong Kong Special Administrative Region a truly sustainable city by incorporating both urban sustainability and quality in urban renewal. Thus, a re-thinking of the project management application to enhance urban renewal project implementation is necessary and is beneficial in terms of finance, public confidence and maintenance of the  sustainable competitive advantage of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. This research is therefore justified. The research question formulated is:How can the project management body of knowledge and practice be applied to enable effective and efficient implementation of urban renewal projects in Hong Kong SAR?.Investigation of the extant literature in chapter 2 identified gaps in the body of knowledge and practice of applying professional project management principles and practices to urban renewal projects. A project management application model was formulated with five research issues that need to be resolved before the research question could be answered. These five research issues covered:&#8226; project organisational structure&#8226; team structure&#8226; attributes of team members&#8226; stakeholder management&#8226; communication and information technology enablersThe five research issues considered were:&#8226; Research Issue 1: What are the effects of projectised type organisational structure with integrated and multidisciplinary teams, corporate communication team, social services teams and informal project management community for each targeted district on urban renewal projects implementation?&#8226; Research Issue 2: What are the effects of a headquarters organisational structure with formal project management community, project auditing team, project support group and functional specialist advisory group on supporting the projectised organisational structure for each targeted district?&#8226; Research Issue 3: What are the effects of a flattened hierarchical structure with team members possessing sustainability knowledge and project managerial leaders being generalising specialists on the project team performance?&#8226; Research Issue 4: What are the effects of involving stakeholders at the outset of and throughout the projects with partnering relationship and formation of district advisory committee/community on urban renewal project implementation? &#8226; Research Issue 5: What are the effects of adopting information technology enablers by establishing computerised project  management information system interlinked to Web site accessible to the public on communication to stakeholders?The case study research methodology was adopted to answer each of the research issues. In depth studies of Urban Renewal Authority with functional departments as embedded subunits were designed. Less in-depth case studies were also conducted for overseas cases in developed countries like Australia, United State of America, United Kingdom, Singapore, Denmark, Austria, Ireland and Spain for cross-case analysis. A total of 13 personal interviews with different levels of staff were conducted for seven embedded sub-units in the Urban Renewal Authority case. Information was obtained from ten overseas cases from their Web site and also via e-mail correspondence with the appropriate staff in the organisations.The data obtained were then analysed to show the patterns of the results for each of the five research issues developed in the literature review and also for the new findings that were not planned from the literature review. The findings were then compared with the extant literature to identify the contributions that this research makes to understanding how the project management body of knowledge and practice can be applied to enable effective and efficient implementation of urban renewal projects in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The application model for effective and efficient implementation of urban renewal projects modified to take into account the resolution of the research issues and the new findings is subsequently concluded.This research has contributed to both the knowledge of project management and urban renewal. The project management body of knowledge may need to put more emphasis on aspects of sustainability, multi-disciplinary and integrated approach, team hierarchical structure, team member attributes, stakeholder involvement and information technology enablers. Government support in both policy and implementation levels are of paramount importance in urban renewal work and needs more attention and focus. This research also provides some suggestions on the practice and policy especially on change management for introducing the application model in the existing organisation and the need of new legislation to supplement the existing one, on which the operation of Urban Renewal Authority is based.Finally, suggestions for further research are presented. These include quantitative research to test the application model built,  generalisation of the research to other places with different operating environments for both governmental and non-governmental organisations, strategy for urban renewal, attributes of top management for managing urban renewal organisation, and cultural risk in managing urban renewal projects.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainable urban renewal</field><field name="subject">project management</field><field name="subject">stakeholder management</field><field name="subject">partnering</field><field name="subject">public participation</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/31</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regional festivals: nourishing community resilience: the nature and role of cultural festivals in Northern Rivers NSW communities</field><field name="creator">Derrett, Ros</field><field name="description">This thesis examines four regional community cultural festivals in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia. It reveals the complex interplay of a sense of place and community, a destination&#8217;s identity and representation, host guest relationships and the underlying nature and role of celebration expressed in each festival. It examines the regional context in which the Jacaranda Festival in Grafton, the Beef Week celebrations in Casino, the New Year&#8217;s Eve celebrations in Byron Bay and the Mardi Grass Law reform rally in Nimbin are conducted. An extensive literature review provides a global perspective on theories, issues and trends in the sectors reflected in the case study festivals. The phenomenological approach to the case study methodology is explained before each festival is closely scrutinized, addressing the study&#8217;s aim.The thesis aims at a better understanding of the elements of resilience fostered by festivals when communities take intentional action. This resilience dimension emerged as a major outcome of the initial investigation of the nature and role of festivals in regional communities.The thesis argues that festivals allow people to reflect and determine a sense of community and place, represent their image and identity and contribute to cultural tourism. Community festivals involve the local population in a shared experience to their mutual benefit by providing both social functions and symbolic meanings. This study contends that community-based festivals celebrate the community&#8217;s social identity, its historical continuity and its cultural resilience. They are socially constructed and negotiated phenomena and can be staged in everyday places that also become tourist places. Festivals provide a forum for creativity, custom, heritage and cultural practices for both resident and guest.Investigating community cultural festivals from multiple perspectives allows for greater understanding of the nuances of the relationships between stakeholders. By identifying the patterns, structures and meanings of the contexts that festivals represent we are better informed of the distinctive values, interests and aspirations held by residents when they host festivals. Perspectives on community festivals and resilience were canvassed from diverse perspectives as demonstrated by the following typical responses:Nourishing resilience through Festivals and CommunitiesThere are many intangible reasons why a community chooses to host a festival such as socio-cultural, economic, political and environmental and each reason is not mutually exclusive (Backman et al, 1995).The Northern Rivers region stands apart from the rest of rural Australia as living as if the future matters. This is a very powerful attractor in these times of urban decay and environmental despair (Dunstan, 1994:2).Sense of place, can be described as, the common ground where interpretation and community development meets in a concern to create or enhance a sense of place, to establish what is significant and valued in the environment or heritage of a particular community, and to provide action for its wider appreciation and conservation (Binks, 1989:191 cited Trotter, 1998).Democratic communities take responsibility for their future. It is undeniable that cohesive community events based on ideals create a sense of community. The excitement and joy that people feel when they work together for their community and future means that they will attempt to recreate that experience. It becomes their preferred way (Emery, 1995:70).&#8230;the notion of community is always something of a myth. A community implies a coherent entity with a clear identity and a commonality of purpose. The reality is that communities, more often than not, are made up of an agglomeration of factions and interest groups often locked in competitive relationships (Smit, 1995 cited in Joppe, 1996:475).Community, the custodians of the content of Australian tourism, must be enabled to participate in tourism by forming its content. Only if Australians are involved in tourism will it survive, (Wood, 1993:7).Through direct contact and interaction with each festival, the qualitative exploratory study reveals how in formal and informal ways participants at the four case study sites demonstrate the diverse and fragmented nature of festivals. Although none of these festivals is identical, some consistent patterns do emerge to demonstrate that comparisons can be developed. These patterns have their own advantages and disadvantages and it is evident that success or failure is not linked to a particular model for such festivals. Each community has an ongoing challenge of determining how their festival can best meet its needs presently and into the future. Each is trying to keep pace with the changes that are taking place within their communities, within the region and from external forces. This is where the study also generates new knowledge: tracking the changes occurring in community festivals in contemporary regional Australia.Through a systematic analysis of data the study significantly contributes to our understanding of the character of community festivals. Through surveys, interviews, media analysis, photographic images and critical observation, it clearly observes that social, economic and environmental issues currently presented in the literature require greater deconstruction and critical engagement. Rich and quilted description of the festivals informs this research providing grounded scholarly investigation. This approach leads to a greater understanding of significant social and cultural agendas in regional communities. Festivals add value to communities. They creatively produce and embed culture. They can be viewed as celebrations of resilience.Through a systematic analysis of data the study significantly contributes to our understanding of the character of community festivals.

Each participant contributes to the program, traditions, cultural practices, impact and reach of events with differing voices and emphases.In principle, festivals and their host communities offer individual members a framework for attending to general aspects of life. This study reaffirms that community festivals particularly hold a significant position in three areas of the human condition. They celebrate a sense of place through organising inclusive activities in specific safe environments. They provide a vehicle for communities to host visitors and share such activities as representations of communally agreed values, interests and aspirations. Finally, they are the outward manifestation of the identity of the community and provide a distinctive identifier of place and people.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">festivals</field><field name="subject">resiliance</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">regional</field><field name="subject">cultural tourism</field><field name="subject">sense of place</field><field name="subject">partnerships</field><field name="subject">social capital</field><field name="subject">celebrations</field><field name="subject">Arts and Humanities</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/90</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Jobless families in regional New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Hartman, Yvonne A</field><field name="description">At a time when welfare regimes in Anglophone countries are being reshaped to reflect neoliberal ideology, there is little by way of empirical, qualitative research which directly addresses the question of how jobless families live or are affected by their circumstances, particularly in regional Australia. This study combines a consideration of questions of social structure as they pertain to jobless families at the theoretical level with an ethnographic journey into their life worlds. It aims to understand the impact of long-term joblessness upon the families and to explore the interconnections between system and life world.I adopt Layder&#8217;s (1997, 1998) theoretical and methodological formulations as the most appropriate means to underpin an investigation of this nature. The study is comprehensively situated within a structural context which examines discourses and events that have exerted an influence on our present social arrangements, including an analysis of relevant social policy. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with two non-purposive samples and analysed using a modified Grounded Theory approach as advocated by Layder (1998).It was found that the current welfare regime helps to stabilise the capitalist global economy and does at least provide a precarious stability for those excluded from the labour market. Whilst families receiving long-term income support are not a homogeneous group, they are subject to hidden injuries in common. The linkages between system and life world are theorised in terms of the displacement principle, which holds that the displacement of a problem does not solve it, but merely relocates it elsewhere. It is used to explain both large-scale displacements as well as micro processes occurring within jobless families. Long-term joblessness is found often to have destructive consequences for intimacy, though family structure may remain intact. This is partly due to a welfare regime which disrespects its beneficiaries. I argue that social policy must be informed by an alternative discourse which includes social or welfare rights as a part of human rights, based upon recognition of mutual interdependency and an ethic of care. This is vital if future policy directions are to accord equal respect to all citizens.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">joblessness</field><field name="subject">family</field><field name="subject">welfare state</field><field name="subject">Family, Life Course, and Society</field><field name="subject">Social Welfare</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/56</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Picking the pitch: a grounded theory study of the impact of equal opportunity officers on the culture of universities</field><field name="creator">Burrett, Ann Joan</field><field name="description">Equal opportunity offices have been described as agencies of organisational change, and the term &#8216;cultural change&#8217; has been used to describe aspects of equal opportunity work.Universities are sites of organisational cultures where equal opportunity officers have worked in Australia for the past decade. In this time there have been significant changes to higher education, in terms of the size of the university sector in Australia, and also in terms of funding, governance and management. These changes in universities provided the context for questions about the roles of equal opportunity officers in universities, and how they may have changed. This research investigated the practice of equal opportunity officers in universities by using a grounded theory approach to generate understandings about how this group of university staff may have impacted on university cultures. The study develops links between theories of culture and organisational change that was situated in the practices of equal opportunity officers.The research identified a central conceptual category that was described as &#8216;picking the pitch&#8217;, as the main theme in the work of equal opportunity officers in identifying issues and gaining support for a cultural change agenda. All of the preliminary themes that were identified, and the interactions, the observations and the analysis of culture were prerequisites for &#8216;picking the pitch&#8217;.The thesis uses the research for further reflection and integration of the goals of equal opportunity, and the means that were available to equal opportunity officers to achieve these goals. The interactions of power and influence, and some of the limitations on equal opportunity officers are discussed.In the thesis the usefulness of the concept of culture to equal opportunity officers is examined, along with the underpinning theories about the mind of humanity that contributed to their approach to their task.Finally, the thesis discusses the impact of the research for equal opportunity officers, and for the universities in which they worked.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">equal opportunity</field><field name="subject">universities</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Inequality and Stratification</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/50</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of business ethical practices in Australian organisations: a multiple case study</field><field name="creator">Wong, Peter Wai-Hong</field><field name="description">In view of the latest corporate collapses globally, the purpose of this thesis is an attempt to investigate and to theorise how managers make decisions when faced with an ethical dilemma.Philosophers over the years have proposed different moral theories. For example, Kantian&#8217;s Categorical Imperative (O&#8217;Neil 2001, Peters, 1971) suggests that there are laws that should apply universally. However, its principles are too abstract to guide action, in that it does not provide a detailed set of instructions for following them. Others such as Baier, (2001) suggest that people behave to satisfy their own self-interest. The literature review shows that there is no consensus to define what constitutes ethical behaviour. Kohlberg (1981) divides childhood moral development into six stages. He theorises that greater moral development will be related to the highest social responsibility of an individual. Lagon (2000), Seabright and Moberg (1998), Logsdon and Yuthas (1997) extrapolate Kohlberg&#8217;s model to incorporate into organisational and individual moral development.Based on the literature review, research questions were developed. The research methodology is qualitative, based on the realism paradigm using a case research design (Yin 1994). Face to face interviews were conducted with fourteen participants using critical incidents and the findings were triangulated using a semi-structured focus group.The research data analysis is based on grounded theory proposed by Glaser and Strauss (1967). The findings confirm that there is no single theory or approach to business ethics. The findings indicate that a person&#8217;s ethical behaviour changes when his/her self-interest is affected. Whilst participants believed that business and ethics can be reconciled, most agreed that they can only be reconciled if the individual&#8217;s interest or business profit is not affected. Based on the findings, a new model is proposed in an attempt to theorise an   individual&#8217;s business ethical behaviour and his/her ethical decision making process.This research also identifies important areas that require further research. These are:&#8226; Conflicts between personal values and business values&#8226; Should ethics be taught? And if so how?&#8226; Should an ethical programme be developed and incorporated in a company&#8217;s strategic plan?</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">business ethics</field><field name="subject">ethical dilemma</field><field name="subject">ethical decision making process</field><field name="subject">meta-ethics</field><field name="subject">normative ethics</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Business Law, Public Responsibility, and Ethics</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/47</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Retailers&#8217; perceptions of product brand equity: an empirical study of Vietnamese independent grocers</field><field name="creator">Tran, Quan Ha Minh</field><field name="description">In the literature on product branding, significant attention has been paid to brand equity in the consumer context, but relatively little attention has been paid to the application of the concept of brand equity to the business-to-business context. Even less research has been conducted on the role of brand equity in the retailing context. Retailers are assumed to be irrelevant to the source of brand value for manufacturers, with the result that manufacturers do not target retailers to help them build strong brands. Therefore, there is potential for some channel conflict to occur between manufacturers and retailers. On the one hand, retailers may tend to focus on building their own, private brands to differentiate themselves from other retail competitors and to increase their power in relation to manufacturer brands. On the other hand, retailers also need to create a good image in the consumer marketplace by selling famous, manufacturer-branded products. In other words, retailers often have to sell famous brands even if they would prefer to sell other brands, or their own. Manufacturers therefore tend to focus on building strong brand associations in consumers&#8217; minds, in order to control retailers&#8217; power.There is an argument that traditional ways of thinking about brands, i.e. only from the consumer perspective, has produced &#8216;both an incomplete analysis of branding from an academic perspective and incomplete management of the brand from a company perspective&#8217; (Webster 2000). The relationship between manufacturers and retailers should be viewed as a partnership instead of competition for consumer loyalty (Narus &amp; Anderson 1986). Powerful consumer brands not only provide value to manufacturers and consumers, but they also offer many obvious benefits to retailers. These benefits include an established consumer demand; favourable consumer attitudes towards the branded product found in their store; a commitment from manufacturers to promote their products; and the credibility and image of the brand itself as an enhancement of the retailer&#8217;s own credibility and image(Webster 2000). Brand equity, therefore, needs to be investigated from the retailers&#8217; perspective, in order to provide a more complete understanding of the role of branding in marketing strategies. This research attempts to bridge this gap by exploring the customer-based brand equity concept from the retailers&#8217; perspective. It aims to explore how consumer-based brand equity theory translates to the retailer context, incorporating the key constructs of brand association, brand trust, brand loyalty, manufacturer support and the performance of the brand.The study was conducted in the context of the Vietnamese independent retail grocery sector. This context was chosen on the basis that there has been limited research conducted on branding in the Vietnamese context and due to the prominence of the independent grocery sector in the retail industry of Viet Nam. A survey questionnaire was developed based on the review of the relevant branding and retail literature and was administered to a sample of 400 independent grocery retailers in Ho Chi Minh City. This sample was drawn from a commercial mailing list of independent retailers. Selected retailers were contacted by phone and invited to participate in the research by completing the questionnaire during a face-to-face interview at their premises. They were asked to respond to the survey in relation to a major brand of soft drink sold within their product range. The soft drink product category was selected for this study due to it being one of the most common types of products sold by the independent retail sector in Viet Nam, which would ensure that all participants could easily share their opinions of the value of brands.Following a pilot study testing the survey instrument, the main data collection phase resulted in 355 completed and useable surveys being available for analysis. Structural equation modeling was used to explore the relationships between the branding constructs of interest. The findings show that the theoretical model has fit with the data. Nine out of twelve hypotheses are supported to answers four research question.The finding indicates that brand equity plays an important role in the retailing context, and it is comprised of three dimensions - brand association, brand trust and brand loyalty. Brand association is reflected in the positive image of a brand in the retailer&#8217;s perception, related to their needs and wants. This leads to a positive feeling towards that brand, which is the trust a retailer holds in a manufacturer&#8217;s brand. As the result of a strong brand, retailers commit to a long-term business relationship with the brand&#8217;s manufacturer. Two of these three dimensions of retailer-based brand equity, (brand association and brand loyalty) are positively and significantly related to the brand&#8217;s performance at the retail outlet. Manufacturer support, including advertising, sales promotion and trade promotions has been confirmed by this study to be an antecedent of retailer-based brand equity. Moreover, this study indicated that there is a difference between the retailer-based brand equity model for local brands compared to international brands, in that brand association is the most important factor in retailer-based brand equity in the international brands model while brand loyalty is the most important factor in the local brands model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">retailer based brand equity</field><field name="subject">brand equity</field><field name="subject">retail trade Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/46</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic variation in cultivated coffee (Coffea arabica L.) accessions in northern New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Tran, Thi Minh Hue</field><field name="description">Genetic consistency within varieties is essential to quality assurance for any agricultural product. While the Australian coffee industry targets high quality coffee, there is observed morphological variation within coffee varieties in New South Wales plantations. This variability may result from environmental, genetic and/or management factors. Genetic factors can be tested by molecular markers which can also shed light on the questions concerning crop quality management. A review of the literature showed low genetic variation in C. arabica. Hence four different molecular marker systems were used in this study to detect possible genetic variation within and between varieties of local coffee grown in Northern New South Wales (NNSW), Australia. Genetic variation in eighty-four seed propagated coffee (C. arabica) accessions, mainly from two commercial varieties (K7 and CRB) in NNSW, were tested using various PCR-based marker systems (RAPDs, ISSRs, SSRs and AFLPs). Eleven accessions from Central Highland, Vietnam, were used as reference material. While RAPD and ISSR did not distinguish intra-varietal molecular variation, SSR and AFLP data revealed the degree of genetic variability and the relationship among individuals within and between coffee varieties. Despite observed morphological variation within supposedly single variety plantations in NNSW, the genetic variation, measured by genetic distance, revealed in this study was very low (K7: 0.193; CRB: 0.205). There exists genetic variation between different farms sharing the same cultivar (K7) which suggests differences in the management of plantation establishment and sourcing of trees. The genetic variability is not aligned with off-type individuals observed in K7, but is with off-type CRB plants which is probably due to inter-varietal hybrids from unintentional outcrossing.  The mean level of genetic identity between cultivars derived from the two distinct types of C. arabica is moderate (0.641). Although genetic variation within and among arabica cultivars is low, sufficient DNA polymorphism was found among some C. arabica accessions to allow differentiation. The results in this study suggested that even the elite cultivars, which have been exposed to intensive selection, still show a certain degree of genetic variation amongst individuals within each cultivar even though C. arabica is a predominantly selfing species and has a narrow genetic foundation. The congruence between AFLP and SSR data sets suggests that either method individually, or a combination, is applicable to genetic studies of coffee. SSR alone clearly distinguished and revealed inter-varietal heterogeneity but were more powerful when combined with AFLP.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plant genetics</field><field name="subject">coffee</field><field name="subject">Agronomy and Crop Sciences</field><field name="subject">Plant Breeding and Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/45</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing unit trust performance</field><field name="creator">Tng, Cheong Sing</field><field name="description">Bank-managed equity funds are not inferior to their non-bank counterparts. Previous research reporting relative underperformance of bank-managed funds ignored their differing fiduciary standards. To evaluate bank and non-bank funds facing similar fiduciary responsibilities, domestic retail funds approved for Singapore&#8217;s Central Provident Fund Investment Scheme were examined, as they meet the same standard for managing social security savings. Returns from these funds correlate highly with market performance. Even though these fund returns exceeded guaranteed interest rates, they did not outperform their market index.With financial market deregulation in Southeast Asia, local banks in small economies withstand erosion of business by foreign competitors. Banks, in order to increase profits, compete with local as well as foreign insurance and investment companies by offering mutual fund products. To remain competitive, banks need to shed their reputation for not being able to generate impressive fund returns, as their funds are not inferior to those from insurance and investment companies in terms of assets under management, expenditures, returns and risk. To gain competitive advantage, banks can differentiate their fund characteristics and reduce portfolio management costs.Mutual fund characteristics can affect expected returns or transaction costs. Factors affecting expected returns include asset allocation and systematic risk, while transaction costs include explicit and implicit ones, which can be measured by expense ratios and size of funds respectively. Insignificance of transaction cost determinants in affecting actual returns can be attributable to dominance of factors affecting expected returns.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">assets under management</field><field name="subject">bank-managed fund</field><field name="subject">expense ratio</field><field name="subject">financial institution</field><field name="subject">fund performance evaluation</field><field name="subject">mutual fund management</field><field name="subject">unit trust</field><field name="subject">Finance and Financial Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/44</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abundance, behaviour and habitat use patterns of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (&lt;em&gt;Tursiops aduncus&lt;/em&gt;) in the Clarence and Richmond River estuaries in northern New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Fury, Christine Ann</field><field name="description">Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) are a widely studied species in marine habitats, however, information on estuarine populations in Australia is very limited. To fully understand the importance of estuaries as habitats for dolphins there needs to be clear quantitative data on dolphin populations and their habitat use in estuaries. This study provides the first published data on Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) abundance estimates, site fidelity, individual ranging patterns, habitat use, flood impacts and sexual segregation patterns over a 3- year period in the Clarence River (CR) and Richmond River (RR) estuaries in northern New South Wales, Australia.The results indicate that, at present, the CR estuary is sustaining a larger dolphin community with a predominantly resident population compared to the RR estuary, which supports a smaller community with lower site fidelity. The CR estuary dolphin abundance estimate of 71 (62-81 95% CI, CV = 0.07) is more than twice the size of the RR estuary abundance estimate of 34 (19- 49 95% CI, CV = 0.23). Differences in site fidelity were observed between the estuaries with 60% and 37% of identified dolphins determined as residents, 26% and 21% as occasional visitors, and 14% and 42% as transients for the CR and RR, respectively. Resource partitioning was apparent in both estuaries with the mean distance resident dolphins were found upstream from the River mouth being greater than for the occasional visitors and transients.Tursiops aduncus was seen all year round in the CR and RR estuaries, with peak sightings occurring in spring at both sites. In the CR the dolphin population showed consistent seasonal fluctuations, whereas this did not occur in the RR population. In the CR the largest spatial distribution of dolphins in the estuary was observed in spring and winter, while in summer they were primarily restricted to the main estuary channel. Different behaviours that were observed; feeding, socialising, travelling, and milling and resting, were found to be influenced by season, tidal phase and tidal range. In both estuaries the core habitat areas used by the population for feeding consisted of areas with considerable slope near the edge of tidal sand banks, adjacent to deeper channels at the entrances of canals, creeks or artificial breakwalls. In addition, the core habitat areas used by the population for milling and resting behaviour in both estuaries occurred in shallow, sheltered areas, often associated with seagrass beds.  Socialising occurred more frequently in the CR throughout most of the deeper waters of the estuary, whereas in the RR it was primarily restricted to a small area of medium depth in the estuary.The major determinant of T. aduncus occupancy in the two estuaries was the flood events that occurred, which resulted in the dolphins abandoning the estuary. The mean predicted probabilities for sighting dolphins during non-flood periods were 0.87 and 0.71, during a flood 0.21 and 0.04, and during a post-flood recovery period 0.83 and 0.80 in the CR and RR, respectively. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) showed that when the dolphins were absent from the estuaries, three components were extracted from the water quality parameters in the CR, and two components in the RR. High loadings from the PCA were associated with the changing salinity, turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen and temperature associated with the flood events. The return of the dolphins to the estuary following a flood depended on the length and severity of the flood event, but generally the dolphins seemed to prefer waters with salinity levels above 29 &#8240;. This could be associated with higher salinities being important for their physiological health, or because their prey returned to the estuaries during these higher salinity conditions, more likely a combination of both of these factors.Sexual segregation patterns were observed in T. aduncus populations with mixed gender and female groups mainly recorded in the CR, whereas in the RR female groups dominated the estuary. In the CR, significant differences occurred in sightings between the mixed and female groups in relation to water depth and behaviour. Mixed gender groups were sighted predominantly in deeper water and were involved in social behaviour including sexual behaviour and male herding of females. In contrast, the female groups were observed across all water depths, predominately feeding and also participating in more milling and resting behaviours.The high occurrence of aggressive herding behaviour by males in the CR was significantly different at varying depths, tides and seasons, occurring more often in deeper water, at higher tides and in non-breeding seasons. Female groups were found to utilise the small, shallow tributaries and travel for longer distances up these smaller tributaries than the mixed groups, which were concentrated in the deeper main channel of the estuary.The deeper water of the channels may facilitate the males in herding the females, while the female groups&#8217; habitat selection of shallow estuary areas may provide a sanctuary from aggressive males, access to suitable prey items or prey density for mothers and their calves, or a combination of these factors.This study has provided the first detailed research on T. aduncus dolphin population dynamics, habitat use, occupancy and sexual segregation patterns in two Australian subtropical estuaries. To ensure the long-term survival of both of these dolphin populations, management of future increased anthropogenic disturbances from boat traffic, pollution, dolphin watching, industrial or urban development, over-fishing and habitat degradation of the catchment is needed. Good quality water conditions, the protection of the core feeding areas and small shallow tributaries for females and their calves, and sheltered areas for resting behaviour all need to be maintained for the continued conservation of these important dolphin populations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bottlenose dolphin</field><field name="subject">habitat use</field><field name="subject">Clarence River</field><field name="subject">Richmond River</field><field name="subject">animal behaviour</field><field name="subject">populations size</field><field name="subject">flood impacts</field><field name="subject">sexual segregation</field><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="subject">site fidelity</field><field name="subject">abundance</field><field name="subject">Animal Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/89</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hedge funds and China&#8217;s stock market: a study on factors influencing investment decisions by fund managers</field><field name="creator">Phan, Alan</field><field name="description">Hedge funds and China&#8217;s stock market: a study on factors influencing investment decisions by fund managersThe research was conducted using a web-based questionnaire sent to all Asia-related hedge funds, worldwide. Analysis of the collected data revealed that the factors influencing the portfolio investments made in China by fund managers differed from the factors which influence investment in global and emerging markets. While market conditions, market timing and changes in earning estimates are the top three influencing factors on investment decisions on global stock exchanges, fund managers are more influenced by global trend, potential growth and company size when dealing with China&#8217;s stock market. Research results also support the hypotheses that there are relationships between size of fund, trading style and personal expertise of managers and the factors influencing investment decisions.The international hedge fund industry and China&#8217;s stock market are two fast-growing entities of global capital markets. Stronger interaction between these two institutions in the future would create important implications for the financial world. The objective of this research is to identify factors that influence investment decisions by hedge fund managers in relation to China&#8217;s stock market.The following implications can be extracted from this research:(1) If China&#8217;s stock market is classified within the Emerging Markets Index, adjustments are necessary and provision should be made reflecting investor criteria for China.(2) Global trends and the potential growth of China were the two most attractive factors influencing investment decisions, suggesting a &#8216;herding&#8217; tendency and &#8216;attention-grabbing&#8217; bias of hedge fund managers.(3) Company evaluation remains important to hedge fund managers, suggesting that Chinese government regulators should implement reforms to improve quality of listed firms.(4) Gaps in the research on China&#8217;s stock market as well as the outcomes of this research indicate that further studies on the international hedge fund industry and China&#8217;s stock market could reveal new perspectives and enhancements to the current body of knowledge on these subjects. This thesis consists of six chapters. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the research context and research justification. The research problem and questions are identified, and the theoretical framework and hypotheses are constructed. Chapter 2 presents an overview of the hedge fund industry and China&#8217;s stock market. Chapter 3 examines the literature: factors that influence investment decisions in global, emerging markets and in particular, China&#8217;s stock market. A framework of an 8-step decision-making process was developed. Chapter 4 researches alternative methodologies and presents a justification for the selection of the research methodology. Chapter 5 summarises the results of the data analysis and interpretation. Chapter 6 discusses the conclusions, implications, contributions and limitations of the research. Recommendations for further research are also included.The outcomes of this research are expected to benefit all participants of the global financial industry, including institutional and individual investors; executives in banking, insurance and securities businesses; financiers of listed firms and multinational corporations; government regulators and independent research analysts. Other beneficiaries will be academics and the media.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hedge funds</field><field name="subject">China&#8217;s stock market</field><field name="subject">portfolio investment</field><field name="subject">decision making process</field><field name="subject">influencing factors</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">capital markets</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/35</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shifting (com)positions on the subject of management: a critical feminist postmodern ethnography of critical care nursing</field><field name="creator">Ogle, Kaye Robyn</field><field name="description">This ethnographic study investigated nurses&#8217; experiences of managing nurses and being managed by nurses within the context of a critical care unit. The four specific aims of the study were to: valorise and make space from which nurses could speak of their management perceptions and experiences; investigate and interrogate the cultural practices and knowledges that comprised and reinscribed the discourses of nursing management; identify the marginal, contradictory or subjugated discourses in the form of alternate or oppositional knowledges and practices embedded in nurses&#8217; experience; and reveal how participants were inscribed by or resisted the various discourses, including the multiple and mobile subject positions they adopted. The ethnography was theoretically informed by critical, feminist, and postmodern perspectives. Utilising the strategy of writing from the authorial position of occupying a mobile or nonunitary subjectivity, the research highlighted the methodological tensions so as to struggle for social justice whilst contesting the romance of knowledge as cure (Lather, 2000). Music was metaphorically appropriated to interrupt, subvert, and draw attention to the partial, interpretive, and intertextual nature of ethnographic representation and to represent the feminine other in a thesis normatively privileging written text. Conducted over a period of ten months, direct participant observation, individual interviews, and reflective field notes comprised the data. Eleven registered nurses, from all levels of the nursing hierarchy, participated in the study, in addition to the researcher. The findings of this research revealed nurses experienced feeling abnormal, lonely, angry, and rejected. Interprofessional relations reflected a lack of individual valuing and predominantly vertical violence. Shifting subject positions were primarily informed by dominant instrumental, patriarchal, managerialist, and modernistic discourses that homogenised the identity of nurses and defined the meaning of progress and normal. Management activities were deemed superior to the activities and being of a clinical nurse. Alternate and subjugated discourses included notions of teamwork, equality, mateship, and viewing management as superfluous and contemptuously. Patriarchal behaviours separating personal life from work life were contested, and behaviours often denigrated and stereotyped as female were valued. Valuing and sharing being human within ordinary nursing work, valuing work for the enjoyment of the work itself, and viewing power as with rather than over were further alternate discourses. The major implications from this study for nursing as a profession relate to nurses explicitly and foremost valuing their own practice and fostering a culture that genuinely permits individual diversity to alter the existing pre-scripted relations that constrain nurses&#8217; ability to engage in more meaningful interpersonal relations. Questioning current discourses and practices that value specific economic and scientific knowledges, support patriarchal behaviours, and silence nurses is essential. The articulation of alternative discourses that value women and nursing is crucial for reconstructing a reality that does not result in women and nurses feeling abnormal, rejected, and alienated; particularly within the context of a nursing shortage.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intensive care</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">Health and Medical Administration</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/34</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of female patients, caregivers and nurses of pain and pain management in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Ratchaburi Province, Thailand</field><field name="creator">Sriyotin, Benjawan</field><field name="description">The care of patients with pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis is challenging and requires a systemic approach to assessment and treatment. This study aimed to explore with female patients, caregivers, and nurses, their perceptions of pain and pain management in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis in Ratchaburi Province, Thailand. The study involved 10 female patients, 12 caregivers, and 10 nurses. Grounded theory was used as the methodology. Each participant was interviewed for at least one hour for biographical data, and experiences of pain and pain management of rheumatoid arthritis. Interviewing was audiotaped for verbatim transcription. A manual method of thematic analysis was used to find codes and categories, and to generate a grounded theory. The results showed that patients, caregivers, and nurses perceived pain and the effects of the pain of rheumatoid arthritis in terms of degeneration, and the need for intimacy and vigilance respectively. Patients expressed their negativity to pain as dejection, and they acknowledged their solicitude and receptivity towards care. Caregivers and nurses felt close understanding and connectedness respectively. Patients emphasised attribution, and nurses focused on the difficulties associated with chronicity. Pain management was in terms of physical, mental, and spiritual dimensions for all participants.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/8</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sulfide oxidation in some acid sulfate soil materials</field><field name="creator">Ward, Nicholas John</field><field name="description">This thesis examines sulfide oxidation in 4 physically and mineralogically diverse acid sulfate soil (ASS) materials collected from coastal floodplain sites in north-eastern New South Wales. The aim of this study is to gain further understanding of the process of sulfide oxidation in ASS materials, which will allow improved and more effective management strategies to be applied to these materials. The process of sulfide oxidation was examined using laboratory incubation experiments. The oxidation of pyrite was the primary cause of initial acidification of the ASS materials studied. Although the acid volatile sulfur fraction increased in concentration by an order of magnitude over the initial 8 days of incubation, the subsequent oxidation of this fraction did not result in substantial acidification. Sulfate (SO42-) was the dominant sulfur species produced from sulfide oxidation, however, water-soluble SO42- was a poor indicator of the extent of sulfide oxidation. The sulfoxyanion intermediates thiosulfate (S2O32-) and tetrathionate(S4O62-) were only detected in the early stages of incubation, and their relative abundance appeared to be pH dependent. The diminishing presence of these 2 sulfur species as oxidation progressed was indicative that ferric iron (Fe3+) and bacterial catalysis were driving the oxidation processes. The rate of sulfide oxidation, and consequent rate of acidification, was highly dependent on the soil pH and oxygen availability. Accelerated sulfide oxidation was only observed at low pH (i.e. pH &lt; 4.0) when oxygen availability was not limited. The application of sub-optimal amounts of neutralising agents prevented severe soil acidification in the short-term (i.e. up to 2 months), but had little effect on decreasing the rate of sulfide oxidation and acidification in the long-term. Sub-optimal amounts of CaCO3 accelerated sulfide oxidation and acidification of the peaty marcasitic ASS material resulting in elevated soluble Fe and Al concentrations. For some of the ASS materials, sub-optimal applications of seawater-neutralised bauxite refinery residue (SNBRR) also resulted in elevated soluble Al concentrations. The response of partially-oxidised ASS materials to the exclusion of oxygen was variable. The rate of sulfide oxidation, acidification and the production of soluble oxidation products generally decreased markedly when subjected to anoxia. However, especially in highly acidic ASS materials (i.e. pH &lt; 3.5), sulfide oxidation and acidification generally occurred (albeit at much slower rates), most probably due to oxidation by Fe3+. Rapid sulfide re-formation occurred in the peat ASS material that had been oxidised for 63 days, with 0.47% reduced inorganic sulfur (SCR) formed over 60 days of anoxia. Biogeochemical sulfide formation consumes acidity, however, sulfide re-formation was ineffective in reversing acidification under the conditions of this experiment. The peroxide oxidation methods examined were method dependent and substantially underestimated peroxide oxidisable sulfur, sulfidic acidity and net acidity. The precipitation of jarosite during peroxide oxidation was a major factor contributing to the underestimation in these ASS materials. Clay mineral dissolution may contribute towards the underestimation of both sulfidic and net acidity using peroxide oxidation methods. The atmospheric loss of sulfur and acidity was also identified as a possible additional interference. This study has shown that the initial pH of an ASS material is a useful indicator (additional to those already used) of the potential environmental hazard of an ASS material when oxygen is expected to be non-limiting, such as when ASS materials are excavated and stockpiled. The recommended action criteria need to be reassessed as the data indicate that the current criteria are conservative for alkaline and neutral ASS materials, but should be lowered for all acidic ASS materials (i.e. pH &lt; 5.5) to 0.03% sulfide regardless of texture. Alternative strategies are necessary for the management of ASS materials that are subject to oxidation when the addition of optimal rates of neutralising materials cannot be ensured. The treatment of sites containing actual ASS materials by management strategies that rely on oxygen exclusion need to be accompanied by strategies that include either acid neutralisation or containment in order to reduce acid export from the site. The peroxide oxidation methods examined were subject to substantial interferences, and consequently are unable to reliably provide accurate measurements of the reduced inorganic sulfur fraction, sulfidic acidity, and net acidity in ASS materials.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pyrite oxidation</field><field name="subject">acidification</field><field name="subject">chromium reducible sulfur</field><field name="subject">soil incubation</field><field name="subject">lime</field><field name="subject">pyritere-formation</field><field name="subject">peroxide oxidation</field><field name="subject">jarosite</field><field name="subject">acid-base accounting</field><field name="subject">acid neutralsing capacity</field><field name="subject">environmental hazard</field><field name="subject">bauxite refinery residue</field><field name="subject">anoxia</field><field name="subject">acidity</field><field name="subject">Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Geochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/7</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical evaluation of aspects of the tourism information commodity marketplace in Australia and some implications for innovation in tourism</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Andrew James</field><field name="description">There is a growing body of literature which discusses the importance of systems of innovation (SOI) to modern economies. Systems which are innovative are characterised by organisations and institutions which identify weaknesses in current technologies, pursue new ideas through research and development, develop and produce technological innovations, and apply or distribute these for the collective benefit of the system. The literature suggests a number of structures which contribute to fostering systems of innovation. Efficiency in the production and exchange of knowledge is one of these.Tourism has been described as an economic system and recent public policy has recognised the importance of the production and exchange of knowledge for innovation in tourism. The distribution (or presentation) of secondary information resources (also referred to as &#8220;commodities&#8221;) has received particular attention from policy makers. The totality of information resources which is presented to information marketplaces at a point in time can be described as the information stock. Past commentary on the stock of tourism information in Australia indicates that inefficiencies may exist in the presentation and exchange of these resources in the marketplace.This research proposes a model of the marketplace for the exchange of tourism information commodities, the Tourism Information Commodity Marketplace (TICM). The model is applied to testing and identifying weakness in current production and exchange processes in Australia. In the research, the stock which is presented to the market is located, identified, catalogued and tested against the model to identify whether there are marketplace inefficiencies in the form of leakages. Leakages are the costs which tourism firms and organisations face as they try to address information needs by procuring and applying secondary information commodities.The research shows that a proportion of the presented stock can be moved efficiently from suppliers to consumers and is capable of meeting information needs of consumers at a point in time. However, a range of presentation and demand-side issues are identified which reduce the potential for knowledge-based innovation in tourism systems. These relate to language, access, availability, reliability, validity and coverage aspects which are associated with the stock and demand-side characteristics.The implications of this research for policy makers and suppliers of tourism information commodities are that dissemination weaknesses, in particular, must be addressed for the contribution of secondary information resources to innovation in tourism to be fully realised. For informatics researchers, the TICM is a valuable and adaptable tool for depicting and assessing marketplace dynamics where information is the commodity for exchange. It augments the understanding of the innovative potential of tourism stocks for systems of innovation as well as identifying potential barriers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism infomatics</field><field name="subject">information management</field><field name="subject">tourism data</field><field name="subject">information marketplace</field><field name="subject">systems of innovation</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Hospitality Administration and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/42</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Challenge, tension and possibility: an exploration into contemporary western herbal medicine in Australia</field><field name="creator">Evans, Sue</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the contemporary challenges facing herbal medicine. Specifically it concerns the difficulties faced by Australian herbalists in their attempts to maintain authority over the knowledge base of their craft and a connection with traditional understandings of the uses of plant medicines, while at the same time engaging with biomedicine and the broader Australian healthcare system. It contributes to the study of the nascent field of qualitative studies in contemporary western herbal medicine by making three main arguments.Firstly, Australian herbal medicine is characterised by its origins as a European colonial practice and its history of professional marginalisation during most of the 20th century. Secondly herbal practitioners have been unable to capitalise significantly on a surge of public popularity in the closing years of the 20th century which brought with it the interest of industry, the scrutiny of regulators and the renewed attention of biomedicine. Herbalists continue to struggle for recognition in the face of these more powerful interests. Thirdly it is argued that herbalists are attempting to gain legitimacy and acceptance as a healthcare profession through a process of underpinning their knowledge base with science, which is replacing their traditional philosophical basis. This has the effect of weakening the ability of herbalists to maintain their identity as an independent profession and makes its knowledge base vulnerable to appropriation by other healthcare professions.Gross&#8217; model of the cultural location of traditions in contemporary societies is used to clarify the situation of herbalists and to identify problems consequent to the political choices they have made or which have been forced upon them. Gross suggests that traditions which place themselves close to power have difficulty in maintaining their own character and integrity, but that other cultural locations are also problematic and limit full participation in society. vi It is argued that there are compelling reasons to move beyond Gross&#8217; analysis and to find ways to strengthen the independence of the herbal profession. Given the financial problems facing the current healthcare system in Australia and the looming ecological challenges, radical changes to the current system are required. The central concepts of herbal practice, in particular vitalism and holism, lead to approaches to healthcare which are potentially both costeffective and ecologically sustainable. A robust and independent profession of western herbalists, with their philosophy articulated and restored, could provide a valuable and sustainable contribution to Australian healthcare.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">herbal medicine</field><field name="subject">herbalists</field><field name="subject">tradition</field><field name="subject">margenalisation</field><field name="subject">professionalisation</field><field name="subject">phytotherapy</field><field name="subject">social epistemology</field><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="subject">Arts and Humanities</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/86</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The care that shines from within: the role of spirituality in aged and palliative care : A qualitative study that explores how spirituality informs care-giving to the elderly and dying in home and residential care in a regional area on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Bloemhard, Anna C</field><field name="description">The importance of spirituality in relation to mental well-being and physical health is currently well regarded in the academic literature. Therefore spiritual care is now considered an important aspect of holistic healing practices. However, research is showing that most health care providers do not feel competent or confident in this area of care. In this thesis I explore how spiritual care is understood and experienced by practitioners in aged and palliative care in a regional area on the coast of New South Wales. The 26 participants, whose insights and experiences are depicted in this thesis, were very happy to be involved in this qualitative research project, because they felt that they now had the opportunity to explore spirituality and spiritual care.The participants in this research describe spiritual care as involving doing in the form of religious practices, such as praying or bible readings and non-religious activities that were seen as spiritual such as talking about dying, touching people or reminiscing. Additionally, they also commented about spiritual care as a special way of being with clients, which involved qualities and attitudes that were clearly felt or recognized by the participants as special. Not necessarily labeled as spiritual care, this special way of being was described as not being separate, but being an integral part of the daily acts of caring such as feeding a patient or preparing them for a bath. Participants found it often difficult to elaborate on what made such an interaction spiritual or how to describe the quality of these interactions as there seemed to be no familiar language to share the experiences of spirituality and spiritual care. Additionally, participants commented quite regularly that, although spiritual care was seen as important, there were many factors that inhibited these practices. In reflecting on these issues I put forward that, although the practitioners in this research are familiar with spiritual care, the most important contribution to encouraging health care providers to feel more confident is to continue conversations about spiritual care to increase competency in a non-denominational spiritual discourse in aged and palliative care.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="subject">Geriatrics</field><field name="subject">Medicine and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/73</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planting the seeds of change and growing the fruits of transdisciplinary educational design</field><field name="creator">O'Reilly, Meg</field><field name="description">The professional practice of educational design normally involves collaborating with a subject matter expert on a one-to-one basis and is only occasionally undertaken in teams. This thesis argues that a team-based approach to educational design is powerful and particularly so when transdisciplinary collaborations are facilitated. Transdisciplinary educational design is the process of standing outside one&#8217;s discipline to collaborate with colleagues from the technical sphere, the library and other disciplines. The common ground shared by the transdisciplinary teams in this research was student assessment.The core data collection for this research was completed between July 2002 and June 2005. Using an overarching action research methodology, three cycles of data collection were completed by action learning sets. Suitable members of the sets were identified through a series of online staff development workshops that were designed and facilitated by the researcher. Two supplementary data collection activities were also undertaken. The first of these was a Web survey that broadly mapped design practices for online assessment in four Australian regional universities. Three rounds of telephone interviews then followed up on survey responses. The second supplementary data collection was undertaken between the second and third action learning cycles to contextualise the online assessment design activities at Southern Cross University within the broader framework provided by the other three regional universities in the original sample. It included focus groups with educational designers and face-to-face interviews with three academics at each of these universities. The entire series of data collection activities was reflectively managed to heighten its effectiveness. This management included screening of suitable participants, negotiation of manageable session times and duration, and establishment of ground rules for attendance and interactions, as well as drawing out a commitment to observe silences as creative spaces in the design process.In keeping with the action research paradigm, an extensive examination of the literature not only provides a background for the research questions but also continues to be threaded throughout the thesis as data collection cycles directed further literature review. The thesis narrative is given an original form through the use of a gardening metaphor that serves to highlight the rewarding, delicate and transitional nature of this kind of educational design. Such transitional aspects of educational design allow for innovation and creativity not evident in the systems-based approaches to designing instruction. This research also supports current initiatives in Australian higher education concerning the first year experience, embedding graduate attributes in the curriculum, and blending on-campus and off-campus learners into one class. The transdisciplinary approach to educational design explored through this research responds effectively to the varied issues in designing online assessment and developing innovative approaches by academic staff</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational design</field><field name="subject">academic staff development</field><field name="subject">online assessment</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">action learning</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/71</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate entrepreneurship and government business enterprises: the pre-paradigmatic dance of the chameleon</field><field name="creator">Sadler, Robert John</field><field name="description">The existing research into corporate entrepreneurship is based upon experiences in the private sector. Reforms of public sectors throughout the western world are focussing on entrepreneurial practices as part of a program to align public sector management practices with those of the private sector.This research concentrates on corporate entrepreneurship in the public sector and specifically addresses opportunities for the emergence of corporate entrepreneurship in Government Business Enterprises (&#8220;GBEs&#8221;).The literature assumes that entrepreneurial practices in the private sector may be foisted upon the public sector. The paper proposes that corporate entrepreneurship in the public sector is the result of different influencing factors and involves different processes from its private sector counterpart.Building on private sector research this research examines those factors that stimulate and constrain corporate entrepreneurship in the public sector. It addresses the extent to which the influences of factors that stimulate corporate entrepreneurship in the private sector are replicated in GBEs. This analysis generates a model that is founded on:1. Three research propositions that concern the correlation between those factors that foster corporate entrepreneurship in the private sector and those applicable to GBEs. They also address the preponderance of those facilitating factors in corporatised and non-corporatised GBEs; and2. An investigation into the manner in which the facilitating factors influence opportunities for the emergence of corporate entrepreneurship and the extent of that potential emergence. The presence or absence of factors that stimulate or constrain corporate entrepreneurship, however, does not explain its occurrence or absence. Public sector organisations which ensure that the influence of those factors that facilitate corporate entrepreneurship outweigh the influence of the inhibiting factors are more likely to be ready and able to react to opportunities to create value by adopting entrepreneurial processes. This is the basis of a Model that is developed and refined during the course of the paper.The Research Propositions were tested by a survey of 322 publicly urban water businesses located throughout Australia. The Model was illuminated and enhanced by considering case studies from twelve urban water businesses. The literature demonstrates that reforms to the public sector since the late 1970&#8217;s have created opportunities for corporate entrepreneurship. The literature also reveals that entrepreneurship is a strategic phenomenon. This paper demonstrates that the environment within which corporate entrepreneurship may occur is influenced by the organisation&#8217;s existence within either the public or the private sector and, within the public sector, the environmental and operating features of the entity as either a corporatised GBE, a non-corporatised GBE or other structure.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">public sector management</field><field name="subject">public sector reform</field><field name="subject">corporate entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">government business enterprise</field><field name="subject">corporatisation</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/38</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ultrasound imaging of finger tendons at the bedside in the emergency department: a pilot study to assess whether it is a feasible and useful investigation</field><field name="creator">Hall, Ann Charlotte</field><field name="description">The interplay of structures in the finger that facilitate movement is complex and not yet fully understood. Subtle finger injuries are often missed during the initial assessment in the Emergency Department, because clinical examination of the acutely injured hand can be difficult. The consequences of unrecognized finger injuries can be devastating for the patient. Ultrasound imaging of tendons is a useful investigative tool although little has been published regarding the reliability of finger tendon measurements. The overall objective of this project was to establish if bedside ultrasound imaging of tendons was possible and useful in the setting of acute injury. The project was divided into two studies.In the first study, 65 apparently normal volunteers were scanned to allow the principal investigator to practise and refine the ultrasound technique. The dimensions of the Extensor Digitorum Longus and two flexor tendons combined (Flexor Digitorum Profundus and Flexor Digitorum Superficialis) were measured in both transverse and longitudinal sections. Fifteen of the volunteers had their left middle fingers scanned twice within 48 hours to establish the test to retest reliability of tendon measurement. The established scanning technique was simple to perform and the scans, including both static and real time images, were completed within five minutes. All volunteers were able to tolerate a full scan. Measurement of tendon width showed fair to good reliability (Intra class correlation [ICC] of flexor tendons = 0.66, ICC of extensor tendon = 0.54). However measurement of the depth of all the tendons was unreliable test to retest (ICC &lt; 0.37).In the second study, 30 patients who presented to the Emergency Department at Lismore Base Hospital with hand injuries were scanned for evidence of tendon injury and tendon gliding restriction. The patient&#8217;s ability to tolerate ultrasound examination was investigated. The scan findings were compared with the clinical findings and then to the operation report or to the patient&#8217;s self reported outcome, one month after injury.Patients were willing to undergo ultrasound examination regardless of the extent of their injury. There was a significant difference (p = 0.04) in scan tolerance related to the site of injury with 50% of those with extensor surface injuries having completed scans in comparison to 36% with flexor surface injuries and 9.1% of finger tip injuries. Injury mechanism was not related to scan tolerance.Excluding a partial tendon laceration was technically difficult due to the presence of anisotropy artefact. However, all complete tendon lacerations were successfully identified prior to surgery. The gliding of the tendons was easy to visualize and abnormal gliding was found to be a marker of tendon injury.The overall results show that ultrasound imaging of finger tendons at the bedside in the Emergency Department is a feasible examination to perform. The addition of ultrasound examination, however, did not identify any cases of tendon injury not already suspected on routine clinical examination.Therefore, this pilot study suggests that routine use of ultrasound examination to detect finger tendon injury in the Emergency Department setting will not prove to be a useful investigation. There may be a role for ultrasound as a screening tool as the gliding of normal tendons differed noticeably from the gliding of injured tendons. The presence of normal tendon gliding may be helpful in identifying those patients that are safe to be discharged from the Emergency Department without further evaluation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ultrasound</field><field name="subject">finger</field><field name="subject">tendon</field><field name="subject">emergency</field><field name="subject">injury</field><field name="subject">Medicine and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Radiology</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/88</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Grandparents raising their grandchildren: impact of the transition from a traditional grandparent role to a grandparent-as-parent role</field><field name="creator">Backhouse, Jan</field><field name="description">In many Western societies grandparents take on the role of occasional or short-term care providers of their grandchildren. However, recent years have witnessed a significant increase, both in Australia and overseas, in the number of children being raised by their grandparents due to the inability of the children&#8217;s parents to effectively meet their parenting responsibilities.This study is an interpretive inquiry that seeks to understand the meanings grandparents attach to their experiences of the grandparent-as-parent role, rather than the traditional grandparent role. The study also investigates how assuming the non-traditional grandparent role has influenced the identity of grandparent caregivers. A narrative inquiry approach was employed to &#8216;hear the voices&#8217; of 34 grandparents who were raising their grandchildren in NSW, Australia. In-depth interviews were conducted with each of the participants and their narratives were subsequently analysed through the lens of identity theory.Findings from the study reveal that grandparents experience a significant degree of roleidentity conflict in their grandparent-as-parent role. The loss of their traditional grandparent role, together with the shift in commitment to the grandparent-as-parent role, has resulted in a &#8216;space of difference&#8217; between the &#8216;ideal&#8217; and the &#8216;real&#8217; of being a grandparent. This &#8216;space of difference&#8217; is made up of a series of binary experiences described as myth/reality, visible/invisible, deserving/undeserving, voice/silenced, included/excluded, which appear to have consequentially impacted grandparents&#8217; selfesteem and self-verification processes. The study posits that grandparents lack adequate support, or doulia, resulting in a prevailing belief that their commitment to the grandparentas- parent role is not publicly acknowledged nor afforded the justice it deserves.The study concludes that both policy and practice in NSW have failed to recognise and address the complexity of experience, or the &#8216;space of difference&#8217; occupied by grandparents who are raising their grandchildren, and provides a number of recommendations in response to the grandparent experiences narrated through this research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grandparents-as-parents</field><field name="subject">narrative enquiry</field><field name="subject">identity theory</field><field name="subject">role conflict</field><field name="subject">grandparents raising grandchildren</field><field name="subject">kinship care</field><field name="subject">Family, Life Course, and Society</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/79</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public sector reform agendas and outcomes for trade unions: the case of local government reform in Victoria, 1992-1999</field><field name="creator">Connoley, Robert</field><field name="description">From the early 1980s, Western governments, led mainly by those in the United Kingdom, have pursued public choice ideas in managing their public sectors, often targeting the monopoly position of public sectors in delivering public goods and services and also the influence and position of public sector trade unions. This policy approach also underpinned the reforms to local government in Victoria, Australia that occurred between 1992 and 1999. The Victorian State Government pursued an agenda of reform aimed at reducing costs in local government, reducing the size and scope of local government in delivering public goods and services and also seeking to reduce the perceived high level of influence of trade unions. On the basis of a literature review of the experiences of public sector reform in the United Kingdom during the 1980s, this study sought to test two propositions about public sector reform agendas and trade unions, using the Victorian local government reform as the primary research context. This was an important research gap since trade unions were a major target of the reform agenda and little research information existed as to how the reform agenda impacted on local government trade unions. Although the Victorian State Government did not possess direct legislative power over trade union behaviour, a reform agenda similar to that imposed by the governments in the United Kingdom, could inflict negative outcomes through the consequential changes resulting from competition in the delivery of local council services. The first proposition was that public sector reform agendas underpinned by public choice ideas sought to inculcate competitive practices in the provision of local government services and consequently reduce trade union influence and position in local government. The second proposition was that the level of success achieved by governments on these dual objectives was determined in part by the responses taken by trade unions to the reform agenda and on the extent to which local councils adopted a competitive culture.Five major research questions and a number of sub-questions were developed from the literature to test these two research propositions. In addition, models of effects on trade unions arising from public sector reform and on trade union responses were developed. The models were important for visually showing the areas of impact on trade unions and the level of impact caused by the reform and to identify the options available and responses undertaken by trade unions during this period. An analytical framework was also established and served as a template for organising and recording findings in this study. The analytical framework served to show the main causal links between the reform agenda and outcomes for trade unions. The study adopted features of both positivist and interpretive methodological approaches to address these research questions. A positivist approach was applied in the development of research protocols to ensure researcher independence. In addition, the information collected was matched to the models of union behaviour and to the relevant elements in the analytical framework. The study also adopted features of an interpretive approach in respect of using small samples and in gathering data through interviews with key informants from three case study organisations, one trade union and two local councils.The information collected on the research questions enabled conclusions to be reached on the two research propositions. The findings supported the first proposition and confirmed previous research studies in the United Kingdom that showed how governments are able to target trade unions in indirect ways through the consequences of the promotion of competition in the delivery of local government goods and services. The study identified the negative effects arising for Victorian local government trade unions in areas of access and influence on government policy decision making, membership levels, bargaining outcomes and relations within and between trade unions. The findings gathered in this study also supported the second research proposition. The level of success by the Victorian State Government in achieving local government reform objectives was in part limited by the responses taken by trade unions and also by the extent to which local councils adopted competitive practices. These findings have contributed important insights into local government reform and trade unions, which had not previously been addressed by researchers. The study has also contributed models of union behaviour and an analytical framework for addressing contemporary public policy issues and trade unions. The amalgamation of local councils planned by the Queensland State Government provides a similar research context in which to further test the usefulness of the models of union behaviour and the analytical framework. In addition, the return of the Australian Labor Party to Federal Government, and their aim of dismantling the previous Liberal-National Party&#8217;s WorkChoices industrial relations legislation, provides a context for testing these models and framework under conditions where more direct legislative changes affecting union rights to organise and bargain are pursued.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public sector reform</field><field name="subject">Victorian local government</field><field name="subject">trade unions</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/69</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of instruction in two-digit addition and subtraction using a classroom teaching experiment methodology, design research, and multilevel modeling</field><field name="creator">Tabor, Pamela D</field><field name="description">In his keynote address to the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics research pre-session, Sloane (2006b) challenged mathematics education researchers to &#8216;quantify qualitative insights&#8217;. This quasi-experimental study used blended methods to investigate the development of two-digit addition and subtraction strategies. Concurrent classroom teaching experiments were conducted in two intact first grade classrooms (n = 41) in a mid-Atlantic American public school. From a pragmatic emergent perspective, design research (Gravemeijer &amp; Cobb, 2006) was used to develop local instructional theory. An amplified theoretical framework for early base-ten strategies is explicated. Multilevel modelling for repeated measures was used to evaluate the differences in strategy usage between classes across occasions and the association of particular pedagogical practices with the emergence of incrementing and decrementing by ten (N10) or decomposition (1010) strategies (Beishuizen, Felix, &amp; Beishuizen, 1990).The two matched classes were not different in terms of gender, poverty, race, pre-assessment performance, and special education services. After the first unit of instruction with differentiated pedagogical tools, the collection class was significantly (p = .001) more likely to use 1010 than the linear class. No difference was demonstrated during the post-assessment. Students in both classes were more likely to use N10 during the last structured interview than in the first (p &lt; .0001). Furthermore, there was no difference between the two classes in using any advanced strategy; however, students in both classes were more likely to use an advanced strategy at the conclusion of the study than they were initially (p = .033). The order of emergence of 1010 and N10 was not associated with the ability to develop both strategies, but there was an association (p &lt; .001) between use of an advanced strategy and success on a district-mandated written assessment of two-digit addition and subtraction.Two original instructional sequences of contextually-based investigations are presented. Protocols transcribed from videotaped lessons and dynamic assessment interviews are presented to illuminate specific constructs detected and to illustrate the pedagogical techniques. An amplified framework for early place value constructs is proposed. Recommendations for future studies, curricular changes, and the need of early intervention are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">primary education</field><field name="subject">mathematics education</field><field name="subject">numeracy</field><field name="subject">two-digit addition and subtraction</field><field name="subject">teaching experiment</field><field name="subject">multilevel modelling</field><field name="subject">design research</field><field name="subject">video transcripts</field><field name="subject">dynamic assessment</field><field name="subject">clinical interviews</field><field name="subject">number sense and operation</field><field name="subject">blended methods</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/68</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping the complexity of computer learning: journeying beyond teaching for computer competency to facilitating computer</field><field name="creator">Phelps, Renata</field><field name="description">For future generations to maximise their capability to operate within technologically driven economies, it is critical to foster computer abilities at every level of the schooling process. Teachers are central to this process. Yet, for many teachers, the need to integrate computer use in their teaching is threatening and overwhelming. This thesis argues that, given the rapid rate of technological change, skills-based approaches to computer education inadequately prepare teachers for a career of continued technological change. Effective computer education for teachers requires more than skills training. It involves changes in attitudes, values and beliefs that provide confidence for ongoing learning. Furthermore, it involves learning to adapt to change, to be flexible, intuitive and above all persistent. It requires the fostering of teachers who know how to be self-directed and independent in their computer learning, rather than those dependent on structured routines or guidelines. This thesis is the &#8216;story&#8217; of an action research initiative underpinned by a belief in the importance of approaches to computer education which foster lifelong computer learning. It traces the journey of a reflexive process of change and iterative development in the teaching of an educational information technology (computer) unit to pre-service teacher education students. Over a period of three years (1999-2001) I pursued a central research question, namely: How can I develop my teaching practice to better facilitate the development of capable computer users? The research explores the distinction between a &#8216;competent&#8217; and a &#8216;capable&#8217; computer user and trials a range of teaching and learning approaches that aim to facilitate the development of capable computer users.From this constructivist research and teaching process a multidimensional approach to computer education emerged, founded on metacognition and reflection. This approach is demonstrated to offer many advantages over a skills-focused approach. This thesis maps the complexity of the computer learning and teaching context, arguing that simplistic approaches to teaching will produce narrow and limited learning outcomes. Rather, a holistic approach is proposed, one that moves beyond the development of computer competency toward a longer term vision of facilitating computer capability. It is argued that the role of the computer &#8216;teacher&#8217; is to foster reflective awareness and develop a learning environment that can assist computer learners to become comfortable existing on the &#8216;edge of chaos&#8217;.This research supports previous studies which indicate the important role of computer self efficacy and the influence of factors such as perceived usefulness, anxiety, support and frequency and duration of use. However, the research also documents the unpredictable influence of these factors on individuals&#8217; resultant approach to computers and challenges dichotomous interpretations of such factors. Appropriate attribution is also shown to be a major influence on computer capability, as are factors such as help-seeking, motivation and goal-setting, although again, these influences are non-linear. It is argued that computer capability cannot be &#8216;taught&#8217; but, rather, computer educators should look to creating environments where its emergence can be facilitated. The metacognitive computer learning context developed and explored through this research is one such approach.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information and communication technology</field><field name="subject">ICT</field><field name="subject">IT</field><field name="subject">teacher professional learning</field><field name="subject">teacher education</field><field name="subject">metacognition</field><field name="subject">complexity theory</field><field name="subject">learning theories</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/67</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital dilemmas: the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and interactive multimedia publishing, 1992 &#8211; 2002</field><field name="creator">Martin, Fiona R</field><field name="description">From the 1990s onwards the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) adopted a range of interactive multimedia activities: CD-ROM, web publishing, datacasting and interactive television.

Drawing on neo-Foucauldian governmentality theory and Scott Lash&#8217;s critique of information, the thesis examines how the ABC operates as a technology of government in the transition to an informational society. While it considers the ABC as a localised, specific form of public service broadcasting, many of the findings have importance for analysis within the broader field of state intervention in media markets. It demonstrates that networked interactive multimedia are a communications strategy appropriate to the governance of a globally implicated market-state during a period of informationalisation &#8211; characterised by increased symbolic flows, spatial and temporal compression, decontextualised and disorderly relations of information. Public service media will transition this period, characterised by rapid social change and institutional upheaval, where they can incorporate and exploit the informational relations that threaten to diminish their utility as governmental assemblage. It finds that while ABC executives used technological change to adapt to the enterprise focus of neo-liberal government, the corporation was simultaneously transformed by disorganisational influences pursuing an ethics of internetworking. Contrary to Lash&#8217;s ideal schema of institutional decline, disorganisation &#8211; embodied in the ad hoc, program-maker led push for internet access and publishing &#8211; can become a force for organisational renewal. This is observable in the development of ABC Online, a public access web service. The conclusion drawn from ABC Online&#8217;s emergence is that the era of digitalisation exposes the ABC as a mutable object, a flexible strategy of national communications governance. It is not exclusively tied to a technical system, such as radio or television, or a practice such as broadcasting. Interactive multimedia such as ABC Online may help the ABC to readdress its contradictory political rationale &#8211; the call to represent a coherent national identity in the face of infinite lived diversity &#8211; and play a new role in connecting and engaging its users.This thesis re-examines that role in light of Lash&#8217;s observations about the nature of informational power. It explores at length the response to a new self-governing, performative subject, the user of interactive multimedia technology. The user, unlike the audience, is visible, often vocal and social. She negotiates both the space of a multimedia object and dialogic interactions within that space. Her exemplary expertise may rival that of the ABC&#8217;s program-makers. This analysis indicates that in response to informational phenomena, the ABC has reconceived its space of government, its pedagogy and its production of citizenship in order to remain an effective expression of governmentality. An online ABC may act as a mediatory, contextualising strategy that helps users negotiate the construction and function of difference. It may also be altered by user knowledge. These relations are possible, although preliminary in this research, while the ABC remains wedded to the more disciplinary relations of broadcasting. The implication is that a digitally networked ABC should not be a self-enclosed institution. It is part of an informational network: a multi-sector innovation system. It should not be divorced from its public or the market except in its ethics of exchange. It is a technology that through its technocultural relations socialises, is shaped by and melds with its sometimes unruly user/citizens. It influences, is influenced by and is part of a volatile mediascape. The ABC is organisation and disorganisation, the rigidity of the one generating the other and then being reincorporated, in a cycle of institutional and industrial change.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public service broadcasting</field><field name="subject">national broadcasting</field><field name="subject">new media</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">online media</field><field name="subject">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</field><field name="subject">multimedia</field><field name="subject">governmentality</field><field name="subject">informational society</field><field name="subject">Michael Foucault</field><field name="subject">Scott Lash</field><field name="subject">online journalism</field><field name="subject">cultural policy</field><field name="subject">Arts and Humanities</field><field name="subject">Film and Media Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/66</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sunan chui da : an investigation of the role of percussion in traditional Chinese music</field><field name="creator">Lee, Elsa.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 195-203.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Music China</field><field name="subject">Percussion instruments</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09MUM/09muml477.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:7354517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The play(fulness) of law</field><field name="creator">Rogers, Nicole</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I undertake an investigation into the relationship between play, playfulness and law. Law relies on a certain form of play, rule-bound orderly play; this is demonstrated, for example, in the ceremony of the trial. Furthermore, underpinning every legal system, we find a different form of play: the spontaneous and disruptive performances of revolutionary violence which found every state. Play can be, in fact, an unpredictable force. Play can disrupt or derail the structured performances of law; play can deflect the violence of the state. I am interested in the dramatic possibilities of using subversive play, or playfulness, as a strategy for negotiating violence. This is, in many respects, a postmodernist work. I draw upon and use self-reflective narrative, conduct my investigation by way of case studies, seek to expose the relationships of power behind both text and performance, and deconstruct accepted understandings of terms like law and play. It is also an interdisciplinary work, in which I draw upon the &#8216;interdiscipline&#8217; of performance studies. In integrating performance studies theory with law, and in considering law as yet another cultural performance, I have disregarded the artificial boundaries which positivist legal scholars seek to construct between law and (non)law. Positivists view law as a set of norms and rules; in law, the written text is sacrosanct. I have adopted the approach of performance studies theorists, who view all social and cultural activities as performance and regard culture as a verb rather than as a noun. Law might endure as text, but it is made as performance. My first set of case studies originate in the contemporary war on terror. Terrorism can itself be viewed as a performative phenomenon and form of (dark) play; it is also, clearly, about violence. I undertake a comparative critique of two different performative responses to the war on terror: namely, the terror trials and the theatre of dissent. I consider the interplay between the violence of terrorism and the violence of law in the terror trials. I also look at the extent to which the theatre of dissent &#8216;plays&#8217; with different forms of violence in order to disrupt the authority of the state. The different functions and roles of these two forms of cultural performance become apparent in their engagement with violence and with the state, their portrayal of difference, their exposure to mediatisation, and their relationship with the &#8216;truth&#8217;.There is little playfulness in the play of the terror trials, or in the play of the theatre of dissent. I turn, therefore, to playfulness in law. I consider eruptions of playfulness in the courtroom. I also look at the transformation of law into play through the phenomenon of documentary theatre. I am intrigued by the subversive and playful possibilities in providing the text of law with a different performative force, and in uncoupling law from violence through re-performance as theatre. My final set of case studies originate in the playful performances of environmental protest. We find different forms of play characterising and underpinning the rationale for such performances. Play in its pre-rational guise is embraced as a strategy to capture the media&#8217;s attention and confound violence against nature. Play, in its ideological association with wilderness, appears in a more solemn guise. Using case studies drawn from the war on the environment, I investigate the relative efficacy and symbolic value of different forms of play, the pre-rational play of direct action and the rational play of legal performances, in countering violence against nature.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">violence</field><field name="subject">playfulness</field><field name="subject">play</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">theatre</field><field name="subject">terrorism</field><field name="subject">trials</field><field name="subject">protest</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">Law</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/65</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What drug problem? Cannabis and heroin in an alternative community</field><field name="creator">de Launey, Carol Ann</field><field name="description">Does Nimbin have a drug problem? This tiny village in north-eastern NSW has an international reputation for its alternative community and its street drug market. Ever since the Aquarius Festival thirty years ago Nimbin has fascinated the media, and recurrent headlines about the village's (undefined) 'drug problem' suggested my research topic. My research aim was to investigate the meaning/s of Nimbin's 'drug problem' in the context of Nimbin's 'alternative' culture. Because the topic of illicit drugs is both ethically challenging and highly sensitive, my research design was strongly participant-focused, with an emphasis on confidentiality balanced by a mixed methodology to cross-validate results. My methods included an anonymous household (door-to-door) survey based on a national household survey; an anonymous mailed-back survey of Nimbin and Lismore drug injectors; taped interviews with health and legal professionals, cannabis activists and drug dealers; semi-structured interviews with 'professional' cannabis crop growers; and participant observation over several years. I found the multi-method research design to be particularly effective for investigating illegal drug marketing and use, and the design provided me with multiple perspectives on a complex issue. Superficially, there appeared to be two drug 'problems' in Nimbin &#8212; one was the (largely cannabis) street market, and the other revolved around heroin users, and included complaints about scruffy-looking people hanging around the main street, or overdosing in the public toilet. However, my research suggested that these issues, while immediately comprehensible as 'drug problems', obscured more complex issues. For example, the village's street drug market was intertwined with the local economy and with the alternative community's values and drug use, while close to half of the drug injectors lacked secure housing (which creates problems that are not related to heroin), and all heroin users were blamed for the actions of few. Many factors influence the creation and maintenance of what we might call 'problems', and drugs are frequently blamed for broader social problems. What is Nimbin&#8217;s drug problem? The answer depends, in part, on the drug of interest, but more importantly it depends on your definition of a &#8216;problem&#8217;. Some useful and meaningful perspectives on this important social issue include quantified indicators such as death, injury, arrest rates, the economics of black markets, the demographics of drug use, and estimates of &#8216;social costs&#8217;. Qualitative perspectives include people&#8217;s opinions about drugs, media-generated moral panics, the effects of social marginalisation, and the role of drug cultures. A number of &#8216;drug problems&#8217; arise as a direct result of drug illegality. They include black markets, corruption, drug-related violence, theft, stronger forms of the drug, and more dangerous using practices (with the risk drug overdoses and HIV/AIDS), as well as public nuisance issues. Government policy, judicial sentencing and public opinion are moving towards the social reintegration of illicit drug users, but this is almost invariably counter-balanced by a toughening of legal sanctions against supply of the same drug. Most discussions about illicit drugs fail to consider the long-term implications of harsh penalties for, and elaborate and punitive police operations (such as occurred throughout my Nimbin research) against, small-scale independent growers and dealers. The only way to directly engage with drug markets and all the attendant problems, is to legitimise and regulate the supply of recreational drugs. I discuss several examples of the important role of the drug culture in mitigating problems caused by illegality. One example is the influence of Nimbin's alternative community on the style of the drug market. The village drug scene more closely resembles the many north coast village craft markets, than it does Kings Cross, Cabramatta or New York's Bronx. Buyers are north coast locals, along with national and international tourists (the small village is known to cannabis users world-wide, both through media attention and word-of-mouth). Nimbin offers a 'safe' village market ambience and competitive prices to a mainly cannabis using clientele. I suggest that there are two major underlying influences on the experience of a &#8216;drug problem&#8217;, regardless of the drug or the place. They are: 1. Political influences &#8212; specifically the effects of government policy on black markets, law enforcement practices, and access to services and resources; 2. Cultural influences &#8212; particularly the beneficial effects of norms and functional role models for the safe use of a drug, cultural effects on the drug market, and the role/s of the drug in the day-to-day life of the culture. These influences can operate with, or despite, each other, and can create or ameliorate many &#8216;drug problems&#8217;. In the case of Nimbin&#8217;s alternative culture, government policy has created a number of drug problems and the counter-culture has worked to minimise them. In my research into Nimbin&#8217;s &#8216;drug problem&#8217; I have clarified some issues and raised a number of others. I have examined the notion of a &#8216;drug problem&#8217; from several perspectives using a range of research tools, and discussed some key influences on the problem associated with drug use. Drawing from the Nimbin research and my reading, I suggest legalising the recreational drugs to bring them under the dual controls of supply legislation and social norms. In conclusion, I suggest that we need to be very clear about what &#8216;drug problem&#8217; it is that we are talking about, and indeed, whether the problem is really about drugs at all.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drug culture</field><field name="subject">heroin</field><field name="subject">cannabis</field><field name="subject">illicit drug use</field><field name="subject">Social and Behavioral Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/60</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cooperative education partnerships: an examination of reciprocal relationships between universities and tourism and hospitality industry organisations in providing professional development education for their employees</field><field name="creator">Breen, Helen</field><field name="description">Cooperative educational partnerships in Australia are considered to be innovative ventures where universities join with industry in a working relationship, sharing resources to develop and provide professional development education for the industry employees. The distinguishing feature of a cooperative education partnership is that all partners contribute to the development, design and delivery of academic courses in the workplace.This research assesses the role and key aspects of professionalism developed by professional development education for industry employees. More specifically, the investigation examined the conditions that contribute to building mutually beneficial, reciprocal cooperative education partnerships between a university and its tourism and hospitality partners.A qualitative approach was adopted to analyse and to understand five cooperative education partnerships situated within the School of Tourism and Hospitality Management Southern Cross University, Lismore, Australia. The investigation used the &#8216;Tit-for-Tat&#8217; strategy (Axelrod, 1984; Ridley, 1996; Davies, 1999) based on the old French game of &#8216;Prisoners Dilemma&#8217; (Campbell, 1983; Trivers, 1983) to examine reciprocity.The investigation revealed that providing university-level professional development education through cooperative education partnerships contributed to the development and enhancement of professionalism in the tourism and hospitality organisations involved in the study. Two aspects of professionalism, a renewal of learning, and establishing a positive professional reputation, were found to be important for advancing professionalism in this education arena.A further finding was that when a university, tourism and hospitality businesses and industry associations join together in cooperative education partnerships, they generally respond and adapt to each other in reciprocal ways to ensure the sustainability and success of their partnership. Adjustment, adaptation, responsiveness and synergy were found to be important reciprocal concepts that underpin cooperative dynamics in this investigation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">universities</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">hospitality</field><field name="subject">Higher Education Administration</field><field name="subject">Hospitality Administration and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/51</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emotional intelligence (EQ), customer service and sustainable competitive advantage: a case study to assess the importance of emotional intelligence in enhancing customer service in a Malaysian property development company, bringing about a sustainable competitive advantage</field><field name="creator">Teh, Allen Keat Beng</field><field name="description">The Malaysian property development industry contends with economic challenges arising from increased competition and property glut in the market. The situation is further worsen by the onslaught of world disasters for example tsunamis, earthquakes, bird flu pandemic and terrorist attacks, thus weakening the spending power of property buyers and investors. This exploratory research therefore investigated the importance of Emotional Intelligence (EQ) in enhancing customer service for sustainable competitive advantage. Guided by an analytical framework, it reviewed the key issues in the context of customer service within the Malaysian property development industry, the existing challenges faced by Malaysian property development companies, emotional intelligence (EQ) and training and development.The identified research gaps permitted the crafting of three Research Propositions. The combined outputs from the literature review, analysis of the research data and conclusions provided useful insights on the research problem. The case study methodology, supplemented by two other categories of exploratory research, namely experience surveys and one-on-one interviews, were the research techniques used to test the research propositions.The participants involved in the experience survey and one-on-one interviews included Heads of Department from the case-study company, Frontline employees, existing clients and vendors supplying goods and services to the case-study company. The procedure of data analysis consisted of examining, categorising, tabulating and recombining the evidence to address the research problem and the related research questions.The testing, by this research, yielded useful insights on the research problem.First, in order for Malaysian property developers to gain a sustainable competitive advantage, there is a need for fresh emphasis and commitment towards customer service, placing special focus on the development of employees in the area of emotional intelligence (EQ) through the reinforcement of emotional competencies. Despite efforts to enhance customer service through training programmes, the lack of effectiveness needs to be addressed and new measures should be undertaken.Second, the need for Malaysian property development companies to understand the importance of building a service culture and to begin by formulating and implementing a service strategy and it is here that leadership plays a critical role in ensuring the success of every customer service programme throughout the entire organisation. This suggests that new approaches to creating a service culture are necessary, benchmarking with best practices of service leaders around the world, even from different industries. Third, the need for the customer service training model to be reviewed and revamped. It calls for new emphasis on the development of emotional intelligence (EQ) competencies, to ensure training effectiveness and the achievement of customer service excellence through human capital.Finally, the research findings permitted the construct of a policy framework for securing sustainable competitive advantage. The research yielded useful insights for theory and model building. In respect of enhancing customer service to achieve sustainable competitive advantage in the Malaysian property development market, the research findings suggested a Service Culture Development Model that will ensure that customer service excellence can be maintained and delivered consistently, leading to a sustainable competitive advantage in the marketplace. In respect of enhancing customer service through the development of EQ competencies in every employee and throughout the organisation, the research findings suggested a new Customer Service Training Model, where EQ competencies development programme becomes the pre-requisite foundational programme for all employees, prior to the training of customer service skill-sets. In order to create a service culture throughout the entire organisation, a customer service-oriented organisation will ensure that all employees, including top management personnel, participate in the EQ development programme.Follow-up research to test a model, based on this framework should further contribute to new theory development in emotional intelligence impacting customer service in the Malaysian property development industry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Malaysian property development</field><field name="subject">sustainable competitive advantage</field><field name="subject">customer service</field><field name="subject">service culture</field><field name="subject">emotional intelligence</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">emotional competencies</field><field name="subject">service strategy</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurial and Small Business Operations</field><field name="subject">Organizational Behavior and Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/43</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of a critical realist perspective in education</field><field name="creator">Shipway, Bradley</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the implications of a critical realist perspective for the field of education. Areas of consonance and divergence between two traditions of critical realism which have previously not referenced each other are outlined. It is argued that both theological critical realism and "Bhaskarian" critical realism are consonant in terms of their base tenets, and support the concept of a postfoundational, dialectical, stratified and alethic model of truth.The implications of this model and the potential of other critical realist doctrines for education are then examined. It is argued that the combination of critical realism's epistemological relativism and ontological realism allows it to steer a course between the extremes of other dominant positions, which are ultimately susceptible to either the foundationalism of positivism, or the regression of idealism.It is suggested that critical realism is uniquely positioned to provide an antidote to the problems besetting contemporary educational research - especially in instances where modern and postmodern influences are involved in a recalcitrant, self-sustaining conflict. The postfoundationalist doctrines of critical realism enable it to appropriate deconstructionist research methods, but deploy them from within a realist framework. The implications of a critical realist perspective also go beyond educational research, indicating a conception of education as an emancipatory enterprise. By virtue of its evolutionary, stratified model of human rationality, critical realism raises significant challenges to dominant views of pedagogy and praxis in education. Given its concern with absenting constraints upon human freedom, it is claimed that critical realism reveals the real task of education as facilitating the emergent rationality of students towards emancipation. In light of this emancipatory mission, the possible contribution of critical realism to the field of education is too significant to ignore.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">critical realism</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">theological critical realism</field><field name="subject">dialectical critical realism</field><field name="subject">educational research</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/40</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disappearing dividends: the case of Thai listed firms</field><field name="creator">Ronapat, Malinee</field><field name="description">The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is an important source of funds for firms and provides opportunities for investors. However, the economic boom of 1990-1996, the Asian Economic Crisis and the recession of 1997-2002 have affected the performance of firms listed at SET. The dividend policies of listed firms have also been influenced by these fluctuations in the business cycle.This study investigates the phenomenon of disappearing dividends in the developing capital market of Thailand. It adopts a similar methodology to Fama and French (2001) by classifying listed firms in line with changes in their dividend polices over the period 1990 to 2002. More specifically, the study explores the characteristics of firms which pay dividends, non-payers, former payers and firms which have never paid dividends. These characteristics include profitability, investment opportunities and firm size. The analysis uses firm characteristics for predicting the dividend policies of listed firms. Changes in firm characteristics and the propensity to pay dividends are identified in this process.The analysis suggests that firms which pay dividends tend to be large and highly profitable, although they possess low investment opportunities. The study also suggests that the characteristics of firms which paid dividends changed slightly before the crisis of 1997 and changed markedly during the crisis. However, after the crisis (1998-2002) the characteristics of firms are similar to those observed before the crisis. This result is attributed to the fact that some firms have resumed paying dividends after briefly ceasing this payment during the crisis. More importantly, when firm characteristics are held constant, the propensity to pay dividends of listed firms declined slightly before the crisis and declined strongly after the crisis. Consequently, the majority of new firms and many mature firms do not pay dividends.The findings of this study are consistent with the results of Fama and French (2001), particularly with regard to the characteristics of firms and changes in the propensity to pay dividends. However, this study extends the knowledge on the phenomenon of disappearing dividends by focussing on a developing economy, Thailand. Finally, this study suggests that investors should consider the characteristics of firms, changes in these characteristics and the propensity to pay dividends when identifying opportunities for investment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dividends</field><field name="subject">capital market</field><field name="subject">investment</field><field name="subject">disappearing dividends</field><field name="subject">equity/stock market</field><field name="subject">emerging markets</field><field name="subject">propensity</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">stock exchange of Thailand</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Finance and Financial Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/37</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Decision making: being a study to develop a decision-making style to amalgamate best management practice with traditional Thai society and culture</field><field name="creator">Kittisarn, Akkapong</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the development of the decision-making style at Thailand&#8217;s Siam City Cement Public Company Limited (SCCC). The research reviewed the literature, including parent and immediate disciplines. The parent discipline was divided into disciplines 1, 2 and 3. Discipline 1 covered the concept of decision-making and its process. It also assessed types of decisions and summarised the model of decision-making. Discipline 2 looked at organisational structure, decision-making and the locus of decision-making. Finally, discipline 3 focused on group decision-making, group consideration in decision-making and enhancing the group decision-making process. In the immediate discipline, the key elements that influence Thai&#8217;s decision-making styles were discussed. This encompassed Thai societal and cultural characteristics, Hierarchy, organisational characteristics and decision-making. Moreover, research gaps were also explored and the study then proposed four research propositions. The propositions included directing SCCC to develop an appropriate decision-making style based on the group decision-making strategy. The analysis undertaken was qualitative and employed a case study methodology. The data was collected in SCCC&#8217;s Bangkok office between May and September 2002. Data collection was carried out using the Triangulation method. This method employs multiple sources of evidence, including personal interviews, direct and participant observations, documentation and obtaining archival records. The findings confirmed that group decisionmaking should be adopted to enhance the effectiveness of decision-making and efficiency within the firm. Recommendations were also provided for improving practices at the individual, department and organisational level.

The global community must now find ways to reduce greenhouse emissions, particularly from energy generation. Wind energy provides one of the potential solutions to generate renewable energy without creating harmful greenhouse gases. Wind energy is the fastest growing energy generation industry globally (&#8216;Operating wind power capacity' 2006a). This rapid growth is being driven by increasing global energy demand, commitment from governments globally to international agreements including the Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC 1997) to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, as well as individual country commitments to mandatory renewable energy targets. Australia, whilst being a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, has so far failed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. In Australia, wind energy development to date has been driven primarily by the development of the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET) under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. This requires a commitment to 2% of total electricity generation (9,500GW) to be derived from renewable energy sources by the year 2010 (Warwryk, undated). It is now understood, that the current federal obligation to renewable energy is now oversubscribed, and consequently the likelihood of further wind energy projects being developed is highly limited (Brazzale 2005). External to the government commitment to renewable energy, the development of wind energy projects requires a range of inputs including, but not limited to; an understanding of the wind resource, security of land, access to suitable electricity transmission grid, a market for the electricity, access to suitable technology and a level of community support. Whilst the literature related to project management and risk management is extensive, the literature related to the risks associated with wind energy development in Australia is limited. This research then seeks to fill a void that asks the question; How can project managers minimise the risk associated with wind energy developments in Australia? To investigate this research problem, comparative case study analysis was adopted as a methodology utilising a structured interview process of project managers responsible for the development of 8 Australian wind energy projects. This research shows that the greatest risk to Australian projects is the lack of security associated with the current federal legislation and the consequent loss of market value of the power from wind energy projects. A number of additional primary and secondary risks are identified by the interview participants, and the research is able to draw out three common themes of risk management strategies. These three themes were categorised as conservatism, due diligence and proactivism. This study contributes to the research associated with project management, risk management and wind energy development. This insight into the Australian wind energy industry provides policy makers, educators and stakeholders with information to assist in improving the political, economic and social environment for further wind energy development, in order to mitigate against further greenhouse gas emission and combat global warming.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wind energy</field><field name="subject">risk management</field><field name="subject">global warming</field><field name="subject">Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Natural Resources and Conservation</field><field name="subject">Natural Resources Management and Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/23</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The contribution of business/management education, to small enterprise solvency</field><field name="creator">Ellis, Peter</field><field name="description">The aim of the research thesis was to identify whether or not the delivery of management education at base level, made a significant contribution to small enterprise solvency. Research by Williams (1986) indicated that over 60% of insolvent small enterprise (SE) owners gave one reason for insolvency as: &#8216;a lack of business/management experience or skill&#8217;. This implies that a significant percentage of SE insolvencies were avoidable, had the SE owner/managers acquired further business skill, knowledge or support. Literature suggests that increased business/management competencies may enable management blind spots within the internal activity structure of some enterprises, to be brought into focus and so controlled (Williams, 1984). This thesis undertakes research, to identify the contribution of various management education programs to SE solvency. The methodology used to test this contribution to business management knowledge, comprised surveys of management education facilitators and program participants, by education institutions from Government and private Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) and Government and private non-RTOs. The objective was to determine, through the use of quantitative surveys, if a significant difference could be established between educational facilities offered and small enterprise owner/manager requirements, with the intention to make this an initial exploratory research. The thesis examined perceptions of SE owner/managers participating in management education programs and whether there is a contribution to the solvency of businesses from an educational framework that gives SE owners who lack crucial business/management skills, direction towards specific information, knowledge and abilities. The intention was to bridge research gaps concerning levels of SE solvency and skill-education available using four major types of business educational organisations. The study included interviews with SE owner/managers participating in business programs to identify their perception of the contribution by courses to the solvency of their enterprises. The research examined whether there was a significant difference in certain clusters and competencies between researched management programs, to establish if completing any program affected positively, levels of SE solvency. Since the research focus was on the impacts of management education on SE solvency, another outcome was to profile the participants who reported positive and negative perceptions of the impact of SE management education courses on SE solvency. These results are documented in full in Appendix &#8216;C&#8217;.  Positive perceptions The group of participants, that generally saw courses as having positive affects on SE solvency, had the following characteristics.  Predominantly male with education levels above high school level up to VET registered certificate, aged between 26-47 years, wishing to build their solvency and management skills, and wanting to focus on assistance from mentors/consultants on goals and business plans.  Negative perceptions Course participants who perceived negative attitudes to the impact of courses in SE solvency had characteristics below. Predominantly female with primary school or trade qualifications, bur not VET certified, up to 25 years old or between the ages of 48 and 55 years, and not interested in building business or management skills. The courses they attended did not focus on goal setting and the participants had little interest in working with mentors or consultants. Conclusion The body of knowledge relating to SE solvency was extended as a result of this study, through working directly with management course participants. This research concludes by advancing the theory that education of business owner/managers is not solely to be focussed on management competencies. A complete business education should include character development and business activity planning, as well as business/management competencies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">business management education solvency</field><field name="subject">education solvency</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurial and Small Business Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/20</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A farewell to meat: rendering ambivalence and transgression</field><field name="creator">Delaney, Cornelius</field><field name="description">This exegesis speaks to the body of work constructed over three years between February 2004 and April 2007, assembled and exhibited at the Lismore Regional Gallery in May 2007 under the title A Farewell To Meat: Rendering Ambivalence and Transgression. Written concurrently with the production of the paintings, this writing maps the literature surveyed and documents the studio research undertaken.This research consisted of collecting imagery from a wide range of sites and allowing it to trigger abductive pictorial responses. Erupting from this collecting process, social texts such as TV and radio news, cultural texts such as cinema and literature, and the subtext formed by my own dreams and nightmares were conflated to become a kind of mythology that informs the paintings and artist books in the exhibition. My studio research on one level, became a kind of phenomenological investigation that probed and responded to a media saturated consumer culture, whilst on another level, it seeks to facilitate the injection of an element of cognitive dissonance back into this culture.The resultant creative output utilises the efficacy of the image and the subversive power of metaphor to engage with several interconnected themes. These range from the dialectic of truth and illusion in the painted space, to power relations, marginalisation and the possibility of finding holes in that maze without exits we call &#8216;capitalism&#8217;. An ostensibly atavistic utilisation of figuration and oil paint is intended as a lucid rebuttal of 20th Century/modernist notions of minimalism and the so-called &#8216;end of painting&#8217;. The relationship within the paintings between the medium and the message (the paint and the illusion) seeks to operate like the drapery found in paintings from the Baroque era that antinomically both reveals and conceals the forms beneath it. This scopic contradiction serves as an anamorphosistic mirror which, in my own work, highlights the subterfuge and legerdemain currently operating behind the veil constituted by technology and contemporary mass culture.The goofy, cartoon-like nature of the paintings and the aleatory strategies deployed in their construction, bear witness to the profundity of play in contrast to the burdensome yoke of labour. The artist books articulate more fully the innovative nature of the research and complement the paintings in a way that adds the dynamic of a digital dimension to the more traditional methods of oil painting on canvas.As a crassly instrumental reason insists on tightening its grip on human affairs, everywhere emphasising efficiency over playfulness, and as coercive structures of order continue to reduce my ontic options to an ever-diminishing range of superlatively insipid and uninteresting purchasing &#8216;choices&#8217;, the capacity for play, for ridiculousness, for absurdity, noise and laziness, for me, became symbolically central.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Contemporary Art</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/11</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strange</field><field name="creator">Prussian, Denny</field><field name="description">Strange is a work of biographical fiction, memoir and critical interpretation divided into three parts: Strange Past, Strange Present and Strange Extrapolations. Strange Past introduces the author&#8217;s ancestors and explores the ways in which they negotiated cultural and location change as new settlers and, later, as mixed-race identities within the dangerously unstable colonial-racial environment of the 19C Swan-River colony. Although the names belonged to real people and the text is based on facts drawn from public records and the author&#8217;s oral family history, the actions and dialogue in Strange Past are fictional. In Strange Present the author introduces himself as memoir subject and, through his perspective as a descendant of the central Strange Past protagonists, the theme of mixed-race cultural negotiation continues within a late Twentieth-Century environment. The memoir also relies on fiction to tell the fundamentally factual stories. Strange Past and Strange Present form the body text. Strange Extrapolations is a critical interpretation of the body text structured around a research focus on cultural, textual and discursive/linguistic hybridity. Informed and supported by post-colonial, post-structural and post-modern discourse on identity and belonging within racial multiplicities, Strange Extrapolations attempts to illuminate the instability of static cultures, ideologies or notions of identity wherever hybridity exists. Indeed, Strange Extrapolations infers that hybridity exists everywhere in an infinite multitude of incarnations and thus remains as a permanently destabilising influence upon every human status quo.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English Language and Literature</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/2</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A research model for the scientific investigation of homoeopathy</field><field name="creator">Baker, Don G</field><field name="description">Homoeopathy is a controversial form of medicine that is governed by the premise that highly diluted substances that can a defined set of symptoms in a healthy person can cure a similar set of symptoms in a non-healthy person. The use of highly diluted homoeopathic substances that may no longer be expected to contain any trace of the original substance is contrary to accepted pharmacological theory. In addition to serial dilution, homoeopathic &#8220;potentisation&#8221; of substances also includes violent agitation of the substance at each dilution step, a process known as &#8220;succussion&#8221;. The role of this process is not understood. The fact that the mechanism of action of homoeopathic substances is unknown adds to the controversial nature of this therapy.A review of the literature demonstrated that a more rigorous approach to the research of homoeopathy was needed in order to investigate whether homoeopathy could be investigated within a scientifically appropriate context. It was initially proposed that, through the successful replication of an existing trial, a series of clinical trials based on this replication could be conducted to test fundamental questions of homoeopathy. For pragmatic reasons, this initial approach was abandoned. A novel protocol that was subsequently designed to scientifically evaluate the effects of homoeopathy, in particular, the homoeopathic treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, was subsequently developed.A description of homoeopathy, its development, its placement within the scientific paradigm and its role in the treatment of various clinical conditions is reviewed in Chapter 1. From this literature review, hypotheses were generated to test the effect of the homoeopathic treatment of osteoarthritis. Chapter 2 describes the selection process and proposed replication of a prior clinical trial with a successful outcome upon which to base a further series of clinical trials to test fundamental questions in homoeopathy. The selected study was a randomised, double-blind clinical trial designed to compare the effects of a complex homoeopathic preparation with the effects of paracetamol in the treatment of osteoarthritic knee pain. The study was prematurely terminated when another study presented evidence that the analgesic effect of paracetamol was no better than placebo. The uncertainty that paracetamol was no better than placebo raised doubts as to the validity of any outcome had the trial proceeded. The proposal to develop a series of clinical trials replicating the protocol of this study was postponed as a consequence.Chapter 3 describes the subsequent formation of a &#8216;think tank&#8217; consisting of epidemiologists, biostatisticians, clinical researchers in complementary medicine and homoeopaths and the subsequent development of a rigorous research protocol for the investigation of homoeopathy within the scientific paradigm. This homoeopathic research model and is described in detail.Chapter 4 describes a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with five arms designed to evaluate both the research model and the homoeopathic treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip and knee.Chapter 5 details the results of this clinical trial. No significant difference was demonstrated between individualised homoeopathic treatment, generic complex homoeopathic treatments or placebo. Furthermore, no positive effect on treatments was demonstrated by the inclusion of a full homoeopathic consultation.Chapter 6 provides a discussion of the clinical trial. Possible reasons for the discrepancy between the hypothesised outcomes and the results of the clinical trial are explored and directions for future research are suggested.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">homoeopathy - research</field><field name="subject">homoeopathic substances</field><field name="subject">homoeopathic remedies</field><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/54</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Total quality management as the basis for organizational transformation of Indian Railways: a study in action research</field><field name="creator">Kumar, Madhu Ranjan</field><field name="description">The basic objective of this research was to assess the suitability of Total Quality Management (TQM) via the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9000/2000 quality accreditation system route for bringing about organisational transformation in the Indian Railways and to develop an India specific model for taking an ISO certified organization towards TQM.The first part of the research aimed at getting the &#8216;as is&#8217; and &#8216;should be&#8217; status of Indian Railways from an organisational change point of view. Based on the work carried out by Khandwalla (1995), a series of open-ended and close-ended questions were asked to the senior members of Indian Railways. Analysis of their responses was undertaken. It indicated that the way they thought Indian Railways should change was in line with the TQM model of change.The culture-TQM fit was studied as a part of this research. &#8216;Hierarchy&#8217; (or power distance) and its related concept &#8216;collectivism&#8217; were identified as the two cultural constructs which affect the successful implementation of TQM. The second part of the research aimed at measuring the hierarchical orientation among the employees of Indian Railways. This was measured on three dimensions of &#8216;dependency proneness&#8217;, &#8216;personalised relationship&#8217; and &#8216;status consciousness&#8217; based on the work done by Sinha (1995). It was found that among the three dimensions, &#8216;status consciousness&#8217; and &#8216;dependency proneness&#8217; were more deeply  entrenched cultural traits among Indian Railway employees as compared to &#8216;personalised relationship&#8217;. On the two dimensions of &#8216;status consciousness&#8217; and &#8216;dependency proneness&#8217;, the class 1 officers of Indian Railways were less hierarchy conscious than the class 2 officers who, in turn, were less hierarchy conscious than the supervisors. The tendency for &#8216;personalised relationship&#8217; did not vary significantly either across the class 1 officer, class 2 officer and supervisor categories or across different age groups. Further, employees less than 30 years old, from 31 years to 50 years old and more than 50 years old, demonstrated similar level of &#8216;status consciousness&#8217; and &#8216;dependency proneness&#8217;. This shows that at least in the Indian Railways, even among the younger generation, notwithstanding 15 years of liberalisation, hierarchical orientation continues to be a powerful cultural trait.The third part of the research aimed at understanding the impact of ISO 9000 implementation in the Indian Railway units. It was found that, contrary to the literature, there was no resistance to implementation of  ISO based change in the Indian Railways. This research argues that because of their strong sense of identity with their work group, the employees of Indian Railways are more amenable to an internal leader initiated change. Hence there was no resistance to change.The fourth part of the research was an action research project aimed at ISO 9000:2000 certification of a warehousing unit in the Indian Railways. This was carried out to investigate the way organisational learning occurred during ISO certification. Three action cycles were conducted over a period of two months. Seven months later, one additional cycle was completed. Special care was taken to see that the conclusions arrived after one cycle were validated from other sources. It was found that departmentalism and lack of team spirit are major problems in Indian Railways. Both are ascribed to the caste system in India. It is hypothesised that since an Indian Railway employee remains in a department throughout his/her career, the department becomes his/her &#8216;professional caste&#8217;. The research then identifies an Indianised version of leadership in the context of organisational change. It hypothesises that hierarchical teacher-student (guru-shishya) relationship with the leader invokes personal bases of power which promotes change in India. The teacher-student (gurushishya) relationship with the leader is conceptually similar to &#8216;intellectual stimulation&#8217; factor of transformational leadership. The &#8216;personalised relationship&#8217; with a more equitable slant can be elevated to the status of &#8216;individualised consideration&#8217; factor of transformational leadership and the Nurturant Task (NT) leadership model of India is conceptually similar to the contingent reward factor of transformational leadership.In the context of TQM, this research hypothesises that there is a sequential relationship among the critical success factors (CSFs) of TQM. For this, one should begin by framing process-based quality procedures and quality objectives. Process based quality procedures and quality objectives lead to development of team orientation in the context of TQM implementation. Similarly, a multi-tier Corrective and Preventive  Action (CPA) reinforced with a reward and recognition system, positively intervenes in the transition of an ISO certified organization towards TQM.The learning arrived at in different parts of the research was finally integrated into a model for transforming an ISO certified unit towards TQM. The model shows that propagation of customer satisfaction as a value and not just as a measurement- as in a customer satisfaction index &#8211; is key for replacing some of the dysfunctional traditional Indian values which do not fit in a liberalised economy. More specifically, the compulsion of implementing a &#8216;Corrective / Preventive Action&#8217; makes a person come out of his/her traditional moorings and thus begins his/her socialisation outside his/her &#8216;professional  caste&#8217;. The reinforcing effect of successive improvement inculcates a feeling of team spirit among members of different functional groups. Successive CPAs supported by a suitable reward system and an Indianised version of leadership mentioned earlier create a spiral vortex which continually pulls the organization towards achieving TQM.Finally, this research establishes a link between the soft system methodology and an India specific cultural dimension called &#8216;context sensitivity&#8217;. The researcher argues that it is because of context sensitivity of Indians that no resistance to change was found during ISO implementation in Indian Railways. This also explains why post liberalisation Indians have been able to make a mark in the world.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TQM</field><field name="subject">Indian culture</field><field name="subject">ISO9000</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">Indian railways</field><field name="subject">bureaucracy</field><field name="subject">organisational learning</field><field name="subject">Nurturant Task leadership</field><field name="subject">organisational transformation</field><field name="subject">systems theory</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">International Business</field><field name="subject">Organizational Behavior and Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/28</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship of morality, ethics and justice to quality of worklife</field><field name="creator">Kriel, Pieter Joubert</field><field name="description">One of the most exciting recent developments in the social sciences has been the rapid formulation and acceptance of evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary psychology (EP) theory informs us that the human mind has certainly evolved and innate mechanisms have been shaped by our ancient social history. Consequently, specifically-evolved mental mechanisms exist that assist the human mind in dealing with complex social phenomena, such as cooperation. Evolutionary psychology theorists posit that for human beings to maximise the benefits of cooperation there need to be efficient ways for individuals to determine whether other members of the social group are operating equitably. Central to successful human cooperation, therefore, we find, amongst others, crucial concepts such as fairness, trust, autonomy, reciprocity, democracy and social recognition.Because the associated mental mechanisms have evolved over millennia they are largely hardwired into the human brain, are relatively slow to evolve, and have not been able to keep pace with the vast and rapid social change brought about through modernity and industrialism. We are left struggling, therefore, with psychological stressors that exist because of the resultant mismatches.This research study considers moral ethics within the workplace as an important component of quality of worklife (QWL), and suggests a new view be taken through the lenses provided by evolutionary psychology theory. This is done specifically with respect to the ethics of a social environment (the business community) that is often quite alienating to our socially evolved minds. This study was conducted with reference to business ethics specifically and it highlights the incongruent landscape lying between that and personal moral ethics. Through the application of social critical theory, it challenges the orthodoxy concerning the relationships between personal liberty, justice and the neo-liberal market economy. It also illuminates the reasons why it is important for business ethics and personal ethics to be brought closer together, and it suggests redefining QWL as a way of bringing about this paradigmatic shift.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quality of worklife</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">morality</field><field name="subject">justice</field><field name="subject">evolutionary pyschology</field><field name="subject">social critical theory</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/29</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Walking two worlds: transformational journals of nurse healers, a hermeneutic phenomenological investigation.</field><field name="creator">Hemsley, Martin</field><field name="description">This research investigated the transformative and extraordinary experiences of nurse healers. The broad aim of the research was to promote the role of the healer in nursing by providing data on the experiences specific to nurse healers&#8217; evolution as healers. The research was theoretically informed by van Manen (1990, 1984) and utilised hermeneutic phenomenology. Van Manen&#8217;s emphasis on writing as the key element of phenomenology in lived experience research was employed to bring forth a sense of lived immediacy and aesthetic colour essential to phenomenological understanding. The thesis was also theoretically aligned with the conceptual model of nursing as a caring-healing profession, developed by Jean Watson (1999, 1990a, 1988, 1985a). In particular, this research drew on Watson&#8217;s explicit connection of nursing with healing and nursing practice with transformational, transpersonal and esoteric insights. There were eleven nurse (nine women and two men) participants in the study. All participants identified strongly as healers. Selection was based on how long, and important to the individual was their commitment to being a healer. The data collection method used was semi structured interview with a predominant focus on storytelling. The overarching theme of &#8216;Walking Two Worlds&#8217; was identified, and within that five essential themes were uncovered: (1) Belonging &amp; Connecting; (2) Opening to Spirit; (3) Summoning; (4) Wounding &amp; Healing Journey; and (5) Living as a Healer. Implications for nursing discussed include the need for the profession to provide support to nurse healers as they encounter challenging experiences and to allow for ontological flexibility regarding the esoteric aspects of human/spiritual experience revealed by this research. Further the need to extend the understanding invoked by healing beyond the obvious and opening vistas into experience which have been previously repudiated by domineering, narrow and spirit-denying powers in our society is also discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">healers</field><field name="subject">healing</field><field name="subject">holism</field><field name="subject">Watson's theory</field><field name="subject">phenomenology</field><field name="subject">hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/22</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The emergence of simple business models on the World Wide Web</field><field name="creator">Featherstone, Michael</field><field name="description">This research project began with the objective of obtaining a deeper understanding of the conduct of business on the Internet. Research regarding the overall performance of business on the Web has been limited due to several constraining factors. Firstly, the shear size, volume, and perceived complexity of business on the Web made it an imposing target for research. Secondly, the interdisciplinary nature of the field had an initial dampening effect on research activity. Kuhn (1962) describes this phenomenon as the insufficiency of methodological directives. He writes (p. 3) &#8216;Instructed to examine electrical or chemical phenomena, the man who is ignorant of these fields but who knows what it is to be scientific may legitimately reach any one of a number of incompatible conclusions. Among those legitimate possibilities, the particular conclusions he does arrive at are probably determined by his prior experience in the other fields&#8217;. Thirdly, academic interest in Web businesses was somewhat diminished by the bursting of the dot com bubble during 2000-2001 as evidenced by the fact that many academic programs in electronic commerce have been discontinued or significantly reduced (Featherstone, Ellis &amp; Borstorff 2004). Lastly, methodological issues arose which limited the application of previously available sampling methods. The impact of this meant that drawing representative samples of websites in order to examine business behaviour became a more complex endeavour. As a result, many fundamental questions regarding business on the Web have remained unanswered. For example, there has been no clear answer to the question of what new business models, if any, are evolving within the Web environment. What is the role of entrepreneurship employing the Web? What are the key elements or mechanisms driving business expansion in the Web? Some have suggested that Web use necessitates greater business cooperation than may be necessary in the non-virtual world. Is there evidence that this is so? This thesis addresses these questions. It accomplishes this by reducing the function of business on the Internet to its simplest element, the domain name, and by employing innovative methodologies to explore the business environment of the Web. Using Complexity and Network Theories as a contextual framework , and based upon a review of existing literature, this thesis develops a series of propositions regarding both the conduct and attributes of Web business, and proceeds to present evidence of confirmation or refutation of these propositions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">e-commerce</field><field name="subject">e-business</field><field name="subject">business models</field><field name="subject">domain names</field><field name="subject">complexity theory</field><field name="subject">network theory</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="subject">E-Commerce</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurial and Small Business Operations</field><field name="subject">Technology and Innovation</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/21</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The policies and procedures for governance and administration that non-government schools in Queensland could use to achieve and maintain accreditation under the Education (Accreditation of Non-State Schools) Act 2001</field><field name="creator">Austen, Steven Roy</field><field name="description">Non-government schools in Queensland must be accredited by the Non-State Schools Accreditation Board established by the Queensland Government under the Education(Accreditation of Non-State Schools) Act 2001 in order to operate the school.In 2005, there were 457 non-government schools registered in Queensland with the Non-State Schools Accreditation Board (Non-State Schools Accreditation Board 2005). The enrolment of 207,859 students constituted approximately 30 per cent of student enrolments in the State. Government funding to non-government schools is substantial  (general recurrent funding of $303 million was provided by the Queensland government in 2002) (Non-State Schools Accreditation Board 2005).The accreditation criteria set out in the Act are: the school&#8217;s administration and governance arrangements; the school&#8217;s financial viability; the school&#8217;s educational program and student welfare processes; the school&#8217;s resources; and the school&#8217;s improvement processes. The Education (Accreditation of Non-State Schools) Regulation 2001 provides further details on the requirements of the accreditation for all criteria, except for governance and administration criterion. This is the major gap addressed by this research.The methodology for doing so was:&#8226; a theoretical framework for effective corporate governance developed from the relevant literature&#8226; case studies of six non-government schools with a range of ownership/governance models to identify their current governance policies and practices and to compare them with the theoretical framework to assess their effectiveness&#8226; a suite of policies and procedures based on the theoretical framework and &#8220;standout&#8221; practice from the six case study schools that would provide an effective corporate governance practice for non-government schools.The potential clients of this research are:&#8226; The Office of Non-State Education&#8226; Independent Schools Queensland (&#8220;ISQ&#8221;)&#8226; Auspicing denomination or other ownership group of schools, their governing bodies and the auditors of non-government schools; including, but not only, the case study schools&#8226; Newly accredited schools wishing to start well.

I share in this understanding in this thesis. Mind you I share with trepidation because the options are very existential to the prevailing discourse. However a doctoral thesis will add to the body of knowledge not simply to confirm existing theoretical discourse or to leave this discourse un-challenged. Therefore this thesis is about the critical mass of cultural variables pertaining to teaching of Australian Indigenous peoples and the conduct of meaningful research. Its primary intent is to offer an alternative to the inappropriate methodologies that currently apply in the generic areas of pedagogy and research (in their broadest sense). In my opinion at present both these areas are pathologically dominated by Western thought. The idea of change and alternative paradigms is addressed in the introduction and this thesis is not intended to achieve anything more than a hearing of these options. This is why the discourse of this knowledge terrain in this thesis is so diverse and so demanding of the reader. The core notion of this discourse is the Japanangka Teaching and Research Paradigm.The Japanangka Teaching and Research Paradigm has as its core the articulation of eight dimensions or sub-paradigms. These are the quality of life dimensions: Cultural, Spiritual, Secular, and the other five: Intellectual, Political, Practical, Personal and Public dimensions. These eight constitute the sum of human experience relevant to the daily lives of Aborigines and as such are key categories to the unravelling of the seemingly imponderable mystery of &#8220;learning journey paths&#8221; so critical to the success of our students in formal Western education activities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bilingual, Multilingual, and Multicultural Education</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Social and Philosophical Foundations of Education</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/14</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Concurrent training in endurance athletes: the acute effects on muscle recovery capacity, physiological, hormonal and gene expression responses post-exercise</field><field name="creator">Deakin, Glen Bede</field><field name="description">The research presented in this thesis examined the issue of the compatibility of strength and endurance training within one training regime, termed concurrent training, in recreational cyclists.

Previous research conducted in the United States has provided inconsistency in the results of investigating accounting data, cash flow and accrual accounting data in predicting future cash flows. No published research has studied cash flow prediction in Thailand. The current study investigates the ability of accrual and cash flows accounting data to predict future cash flows of Thai listed companies. Three regression models are constructed namely earnings, cash flows, accrual components and cash flows models. In addition, cash flow ratios are investigated to predict future cash flows by using a stepwise regression. Data used in this study is collected from the financial statements of non-financial companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand from 1994 to 2002. Cash flow data are selected directly from the cash flow statements. The empirical results show that past earnings, cash flows, cash flow and accrual component of earnings can be used to predict future cash flows of Thai listed companies and cash flows have better predictive power than past earnings. Additionally, the cash flow model and the cash flow and accrual components of earnings model have better predictive power than the earnings model. The findings of testing the models in an out-of-sample period suggest that the cash flow model is a better predictor of future cash flows than the other models. Furthermore, additional year lags of accounting data can improve the predictive power of the model. However, the results indicate that cash flow ratios are not a good predictor of future cash flows. In addition, this study finds that the Asian economic crisis had an impact on the predictive power of accounting data.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cash flow prediction</field><field name="subject">cash flow</field><field name="subject">accrual</field><field name="subject">earnings</field><field name="subject">Accounting</field><field name="subject">Finance and Financial Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/17</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Small and medium business sponsorship of regional sport tourism events</field><field name="creator">Lamont, Matthew James</field><field name="description">Increasingly, communities in regional areas are turning to sports events of a small scale to bring new money into their local economy, provide employment, and provide intangible benefits such as increased community pride. Sports events held on an irregular basis can attract visitors from outside a host community, thus resulting in an increase in business during slow periods and possibly promote the host region as a tourist destination after an event has been staged.In many instances, sponsorship has proven to be the financial lifeblood of sport tourism events held in regional areas, and often provides a majority of the revenue necessary to sustain the successful staging of such events. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) frequently provide the sponsorship necessary to stage such events, owing to the fact that large businesses are sparse in regional areas.The academic community has paid little attention to the sponsorship nexus between SMEs and regional sport tourism events, which this study aimed to address. Grounded in the interpretivist social sciences paradigm, this qualitative study examined five case studies through interviewing five SME owner/managers and five managers of regional sport tourism events. Areas examined included perceptions of sponsorship, reasons why SMEs provided sponsorship to regional sport tourism events, sponsorship leveraging, evaluation of sponsorship effectiveness, and how sponsorships were initiated between SMEs and regional sport tourism events.The results of this research found that the event managers and SME sponsors shared differing perceptions of what constitutes &#8216;sponsorship&#8217;. Volunteer event managers tended to view sponsorship in a somewhat philanthropic manner, while professional event managers were well aware of the importance of reciprocating a return on investment to their sponsors. Sponsorships in this context were initiated either through formal request or networks of personal contacts between SMEs and event organising committees. The sponsorships studied were found to be highly informal in nature and bound by gentlemen&#8217;s agreements, as opposed to legally binding contracts.The primary reasons driving SMEs to sponsor such events were related to supporting their local community and to be seen as socially responsible. Engaging in sponsorship to achieve bottom-line objectives were secondary to community involvement, which confirmed findings from similar studies conducted previously.The results also indicated that sponsorship leveraging and evaluation of sponsorship effectiveness did occur, albeit with varying degrees of success. Both sponsors and event managers tended to exhibit low levels of proficiency in being able to carry out effective sponsorship leveraging and evaluations, and as such leveraging and evaluation techniques employed in these sponsorships tended to be unsophisticated and inexpensive to execute. Only one of the five events studied provided any written post-event feedback to their sponsors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sponsorship</field><field name="subject">sport tourism</field><field name="subject">SME</field><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">events</field><field name="subject">Hospitality Administration and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/85</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applications of quality management in pathology laboratories</field><field name="creator">Burnett, Leslie</field><field name="description">Objective: To assess the feasibility of applying Quality Management philosophies and techniques to pathology laboratories. Design: Series of case studies. Setting: Two tertiary referral pathology laboratories in Australian University teaching hospitals. Intervention: Application of Continuous Quality Improvement techniques to complex laboratory processes; Implementation of formal Quality Systems into laboratories; Introduction of a new Laboratory Information System. Measurement: Measurement of changes in key performance indicators. Results: Statistically significant improvements in a variety of key performance indicators, reduction in frequency of incidents, and improvement in surrogate clinical outcomes were achieved using Quality Management approaches in pathology laboratories. Comparison of environments associated with introduction of a new Laboratory Information System identified the presence of a formal Quality System as a key factor associated with superior laboratory performance. Conclusion: Quality Management can be applied successfully to a variety of pathology laboratory environments, and can result in significant improvements in product and service quality. A key success factor in implementing Quality Management may be the introduction of a formal Quality System.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quality management</field><field name="subject">pathology</field><field name="subject">laboratory medicine</field><field name="subject">TQM</field><field name="subject">CQI</field><field name="subject">Medical Pathology</field><field name="subject">Organizational Behavior and Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/58</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge asset management: the strategic management and knowledge management nexus</field><field name="creator">James, Paul</field><field name="description">This research sought to establish the nexus between the two management disciplines of strategic management and knowledge management. Through a study of the life cycle of knowledge assets within the Australian Public Sector, this nexus has been established. Over the last three decades, there has been a growing interest in the nascent discipline of knowledge management (Wiig 1997). However, discussion regarding knowledge, knowledge workers and knowledge management started much earlier when Chester Barnard&#8217;s management classic The Functions of the Executive (1938) included suggestions made on how to manage knowledge workers. The 1960s saw management authors and researchers such as Peter Drucker (1993; 1994; 1995; 1997a; 1997b), Machlup (1962), and Michael Polanyi (1967) discussing topics such as knowledge work, knowledge workers, and tacit and explicit knowledge. During much the same period, strategic management was also being researched and discussed, with Alfred D. Chandler being among the first scholars to study strategic management. His book Strategy and Structure (1962) described the development of organisations, and showed that the practice of strategic management predated its study as a management discipline. Chandler was followed by other researchers including Igor Ansoff (1965) and Learned, Christensen, Andrews and Guth (1965), Henry Mintzberg (1979; 1985; 1990; 1996a; 1996b; 1999), and Michael E. Porter (1980; 1985). Research continues in both disciplines; however, research on the interface between these two important disciplines is rare, particularly in Australia.The Australian Public Sector was selected as the target industry for this research, and case study as the research strategy. The research strategy combined a variety of methods including interviews, questionnaires and surveys. The approach taken with data analysis was to employ aspects of the approach used in grounded theory. In addition, action research was used as a meta-methodology, in that periods of review and reflection were undertaken that generated improvements to the research methodology. This research has found that there is a marked interdependence between strategic management and the management of knowledge assets. The strategic management process requires skills and capabilities (knowledge assets) for its execution. Moreover, the resultant strategies require the exploitation of knowledge assets to ensure effective implementation. The life cycle of knowledge assets starts and ends when their need or otherwise is identified directly or indirectly by strategic plans. Knowledge assets are acquired, deployed, utilised and maintained until they are no longer needed. They are then disposed of by outsourcing or atrophy when people are redeployed or retrained. This research has focused on the disciplines of strategic management and knowledge management; however, its contribution lies largely in the area of capability management. Corporate strategy theorists, from the RBV (Resource Based View) and KBV (Knowledge Based View) schools, see organisations as a body of knowledge (Spender 1996). From the perspective of knowledge assets, used as the theme of this research, an organisation is a body of capabilities, and to achieve corporate objectives, the capabilities must match the strategies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">knowledge management</field><field name="subject">strategic management</field><field name="subject">knowledge assets</field><field name="subject">resource based view</field><field name="subject">knowledge based view</field><field name="subject">view of the firm</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/25</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrating environmental science and management: the role of system dynamics modelling</field><field name="creator">den Exter, Kristin Anita</field><field name="description">Institutional and epistemological differences between science and management present a challenge to the implementation of sustainable environmental management. Environmental problems are complex and require at least multidisciplinary, but most effectively transdisciplinary approaches for learning, understanding, decision-making and problem solving. This means building bridges between institutional and epistemological differences. The role of system dynamics modelling in integrating environmental science and management is examined in this thesis. An action research methodology is adopted where, over cycles of case studies, the practical application of system dynamics modelling is evaluated. The role of system dynamics modelling in the management of coastal sand dunes, tourism, threatened species management and water management is explored in the case studies. It has been found that system dynamics modelling is a potentially powerful tool for integrating environmental science and management, principally assisting communication between scientists and management stakeholders. System dynamics group model-building, in particular, has the potential to facilitate stakeholder learning and assist stakeholders to think holistically about the complex systems they are trying to manage. It was also found that engaging stakeholders in system dynamics group model-building process is difficult. A model of factors influencing the adoption of system dynamics group model-building has been developed from this research. The model can be applied to assess the suitability of potential case studies and identify potential weaknesses that need to be addressed if the approach is to succeed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental science</field><field name="subject">environmental management</field><field name="subject">system dynamics</field><field name="subject">group model building</field><field name="subject">Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/18</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Just renting': the experiences of sole mother non-home owners living in northern NSW</field><field name="creator">Holdsworth, Louise</field><field name="description">The goal of owning one&#8217;s home, as opposed to &#8216;just renting&#8217;, is deeply ingrained in Australian culture. Indeed, home ownership in Australia is seen as &#8216;natural&#8217; and has been adopted by the majority as the tenure of choice. People have accepted assumptions that have shaped housing discourse which normalises home ownership as hegemonic. In this thesis I argue that the prevailing attitude is that home ownership equates with social and personal attributes such as success, belongingness and stability, giving the home owner greater status, power and choice compared to renters. In addition, despite the various pressures faced by many home owners, home ownership can also facilitate an increased sense of community because it enables long term and secure housing. This in turn contributes to the notion of &#8216;home&#8217; and sense of identity which comes through allowing people to put down deep roots and to express personal tastes.Property ownership, as the key determinant of class in Australia, separates the &#8216;haves&#8217; from the &#8216;have nots&#8217;. However, property prices have risen beyond the means of many low income households resulting in a housing affordability crisis. This crisis has excluded some groups from achieving the sought after goal of home ownership and has left them vulnerable to the vagaries of the private rental market. Others have entered into the housing market and face financial hardship due to massive debt. Consequently, this situation has served to challenge the widely held assumption that Australia is an egalitarian society. As well, property has largely taken on the instrumental purpose of an investment opportunity rather than a place that provides the basic needs of shelter, security and a sense of belonging and wellbeing. Thus the very nature of the meaning of &#8216;home&#8217; has altered in light of this situation with housing increasingly seen as a commodity.Low income, non-home owning sole mother headed families constitute a social group that is particularly vulnerable to, and disadvantaged by, their housing situation. This qualitative study draws on a critical feminist approach and utilises in-depth interviews to explore the housing experiences of thirty-two sole mother renters living in Northern NSW. Critical feminist research endeavours to present the views &#8211; the &#8216;voices&#8217; - of those participating in the research. In so doing, the study fills an important gap in current housing research and facilitates a greater awareness of what it means to rent on a low income in contemporary Australia. This approach is markedly different to many utilised in housing related research which often results in the particular concerns of vulnerable social groups being indistinguishable from others that are faring well within the neo-liberal, &#8216;free market&#8217; approach to housing.By also examining contemporary housing policy, such as the push towards rent assistance at the expense of social housing, along with the promotion of home ownership for those who can afford it, underlying assumptions and hidden power imbalances are made apparent. The study has found that for many of the women such policies work directly against their perceived interests as well as social and personal aspirations. A key finding is that this group is excluded from a socially desirable resource and are rendered invisible, while simultaneously being subjected to high levels of surveillance within an institutionalised culture of watching and noticing. It is argued that the challenges faced by this group of women need to be acknowledged. Policy needs to be introduced that recognises that the main function of housing should be to provide secure and stable homes for all, which after all is both a basic need and a right.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/13</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blitz: discursive bombardments in 'the war on terror'</field><field name="creator">Brown, Jennifer M</field><field name="description">This is a composite thesis realised in a sound installation titled Blitz: Discursive bombardments in &#8216;the war on terror&#8217; with a supporting exegesis. The exegesis offers a context for the project in sound art theory and practice, focussing specifically on the history of experimental &#8216;electrovocal&#8217; expressive forms. It provides an account of the artist&#8217;s perspectives on the topic itself: contemporary political discourse on themes of security and danger. The exegesis also defines the scope of the project and documents the creative process undergone to realise its outcome: an installation apparatus capable of folding visitors into a heightened sense of the zeitgeist of early 21st century Australia. The genealogy of the project is described in terms of pivotal decisions and insights, technologies and techniques used, and aesthetic and ethical concerns. The nexus of voice &#8211; its material and metaphorical resonances in public discourse &#8211; and technologies for recording, manipulating and circulating sound are central to the development of this apparatus. The core body of sounds used in the installation are the voices of politicians, media presenters, members of the public and &#8216;experts&#8217; and are presented in the form of short sound bites. These were sampled from many hours of recordings of news and current affairs material captured from Australian public broadcasters (radio and television, the ABC and SBS) over the pre-election months of 2004. The voices extol and debate diverse &#8216;angles&#8217; on the so-called &#8216;war on terror&#8217; and its physical enactments and outcomes in the war on Iraq. Other sounds offset the voices to enhance a sense of surreal ambience and introduce meanings through metaphor; children&#8217;s voices; rhythmically dripping taps; footsteps; ticking clocks; the drone of planes overhead. Various sound processing techniques are applied to samples and a sonic montage iscreated through random juxtapositions of sounds played synchronously from an assemblage of iPods. The figure of the labyrinth is central to the work on many levels, materially and metaphorically. It is used to structure movement through the installation space, a dimly lit &#8216;black box&#8217; studio of ten by eight metres. Against the traditional practice of silently &#8216;walking the labyrinth&#8217; as metaphor for a &#8216;journey within&#8217;, the Blitz labyrinth invites walkers to fold themselves into a dynamic field of allusions and aural messages and thereby to warp and shift the emerging play of meanings. The walk wends in and out of proximity to seven iPods set in small portable speakers and dispersed around the floor of the installation space. The &#8216;pods&#8217; broadcast playlists of sounds bites that play randomly in &#8216;shuffle&#8217; mode &#8211; against one another and against silences &#8211; to convey a sense of immersion in the discursive blitz of messages about terrorism and war from the media. The labyrinth is drawn out across the floor in dashed lines &#8211; made from small reflective rectangles that light up as visitors move around the space with torches &#8211; and is designed to suggest the feel of a road or a landing ground at night. The meandering trajectory of walking bodies around the curves of the labyrinth creates a choreography of audition, of moving and listening strategically to a barrage of sound from ever shifting perspectives. It invites walkers to listen for possibilities that may lie between and beyond the dominant narratives of western political leaders, to locate the gaps and silences. Beyond the pervasive noise of discourse normalised by politicians and the media, what is it that we might otherwise wish to hear and to speak?</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">voice</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">sound art</field><field name="subject">sound installation</field><field name="subject">terrorism</field><field name="subject">2004</field><field name="subject">Arts and Humanities</field><field name="subject">Contemporary Art</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/12</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary theory: a 'good' explanatory framework for research into technological innovation</field><field name="creator">Myers, Stephen Keir</field><field name="description">This study attempts to answer the question; does evolutionary theory provide a &#8216;good&#8217; explanatory framework for examining the phenomenon of technological innovation? In doing so, the study critically examines mainstream marketing&#8217;s in-place explanatory frameworks, offers an explanation of &#8216;evolution&#8217; based on new insights from a broad range of (sub)disciplines, and makes the practical proposition that this explanation is a &#8216;good&#8217; analogous representation of the technological innovation process. As an alternative to the &#8216;scientific empiricist&#8217; approach that dominates much of marketing&#8217;s research into technological innovation, the study develops a research methodology that is based within a postmodern philosophy, adopts an epistemology of transcendental realism, bases the research design on abduction and textual explanation, and brings together a research method based on the criteria of interesting, plausibility and acceptability. Familiarisation with mainstream marketing&#8217;s explanatory frameworks for research into technological innovation identified Diffusion theory, New Product Development theory and Network theory as dominant. It is concluded that these frameworks are based on problematic theoretical foundations, a situation considered as largely due to a pre-occupation with assumptions that are atomistic, reductionistic, deterministic, gradualistic and mechanistic in nature. It is argued, that in concert with the &#8216;socialised&#8217; dominance of mathematical form over conceptual substance, mainstream marketing&#8217;s research into technological innovation is locked into a narrow range of &#8216;preordained axiomatics&#8217;. The explanation of &#8216;evolution&#8217; offered within the study is based on a why, what, how, when and where format. The resultant explanation represents a significant departure from the (neo)Darwinian biological perspective that tends to dominate evolutionary explanations of socio-economic behaviour, in that the focus is on the principles (and associated conceptualizations) of &#8216;variation&#8217;, &#8216;selection&#8217; and &#8216;preservation&#8217; within the broader context of open and dissipative systems. The offered explanation presents a number of theoretical ideas, and in particular, that evolution can only occur in a &#8216;multidimensional space of possibilities&#8217;, denotes a process of &#8216;adaptive emergence&#8217;, and is essentially concerned with &#8216;on-going resilience through adaptability&#8217;. The practical proposition is made that the offered explanation of &#8216;evolution&#8217; can be used in an &#8216;as if&#8217; manner, that is, the principles of &#8216;variation&#8217;, &#8216;selection&#8217;, and &#8216;preservation&#8217; (and the meanings ascribed to them through conceptualization) are analogically transferable to the technological innovation research area. The proposition is supported through reference to theoretical and empirical research, highlighting the similarity with respect to the generative mechanisms, structures and contingent conditions underpinning both &#8216;evolution&#8217; and &#8216;technological innovation&#8217;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="subject">Management Sciences and Quantitative Methods</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/10</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phytochemistry and arthropod bioactivity of Australian Lamiaceae</field><field name="creator">Rasikari, Heidi</field><field name="description">Crude foliar extracts of sixty species from six subfamilies of Australian Lamiaceae were screened by whole organism contact toxicity on the polyphagous mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). In addition, cytotoxicity assessments against insect cell lines from Spodoptera frugiperda J.E.Smith (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) and Drosophila melanogaster Meigen (Diptera: Drosophilidae) were also made. The findings indicated that the Spodoptera cell line was more susceptible to extracts than the Drosophila cell line and no direct correlation was observed between the two screening methods. However, several interesting relationships were identified. Extracts from sub-families Ajugoideae, Scutellarioideae, Chloanthoideae, Viticoideae and Nepetoideae showed acaricidal activity, whilst only those from Ajugoideae and Nepetoideae displayed potent cytotoxic effects. A range of activities was observed for the 25 species of Plectranthus, 14 of which showed moderate to high contact toxicity against T. urticae. Overall, least promising bioactivity was observed for extracts from the plant subfamily Prostantheroideae, which showed little contact toxicity or cytotoxicity for the 18 extracts studied.  Greatest cytotoxicity was observed from a methanol extract of leaf material of Glossocarya calcicola Domin. Bioassay guided fractionation led to the discovery of three novel clerodane diterpenes, which were not present in the stems or at all in the closely related species G. hemiderma.  Compound 1 was characterised as (rel)-10&#226;H-trans-12&#238;-(2-methylbut-2(E)-enoyl)-1&#226;-(isobutanoyl)-6&#225;,13&#238;-dihydroxyclerodan-4(20),8(18)-dien-7,15-dione-15,16-oxide, to which the trivial name calcicolin-A was assigned. The other two compounds had the same skeletal structure and C-12 substituent but in compound 2 (calcicolin-B), the C-1 esterifying group became 2-methylbut-2(E)-enoic acid and in 3 (calcicolin-C) it became 2-methylbutanoic acid. Although insect antifeeding activity was not observed for G. calcicola, cytotoxicity against insect and human carcinoma cell lines was detected.  Greatest acaricidal activity was observed for Plectranthus diversus S.T.Blake when topically applied (LC50 = 0.25% (w/v)). The major compound present in the extract of P. diversus was identified as the known compound 7&#225;,18-dihydroxy-isopimara-8(14),15-diene. These findings were of chemotaxonomic significance as this is the first known occurrence of a pimarane diterpene in Plectranthus, a genus characterised by abietane diterpenes. A number of abietanes were isolated and identified in this study, though none of which were novel. Promising cytotoxicity was observed from P. fasciculatus P.I.Forst., which was attributed to coleon U, a known abietane diterpene with cytotoxic activity.  Other species of Plectranthus showed potential acaricidal activity as a crude extract in particular P. graveolens R.Br. (LC50 = 0.76% (w/v)). Bioassay guided fractionation did reveal some interesting behavioural effects on mites but in general the fractions were less toxic than the whole extract. The hexane-soluble components of the methanol extract were extremely effective against mites and while the mode of action was not fully understood, it is possible that a smothering effect could be the cause. A potted plant trial was also carried out for this species to determine the effects of crude extract. At time = 112 h post treatment, a concentration response in mite mortality was observed. The control and 0.5% (w/v) treatment were not significantly different to one another but had significantly larger numbers of mites than the 1.0 and 1.5% (w/v) treatment. These results showed that the crude methanol extract of Plectranthus graveolens showed acaricidal efficacy against Tetranychus urticae in a leaf disc and a potted plant trial at concentrations of 1% (w/v) or above with no phytotoxic effects.  The repellency and antifeeding effects of some plant extracts were evaluated against Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) in a choice and no-choice bioassay. The most outstanding results were observed for Ajuga australis L. against both second and third instar larvae. The active constituents were present as minor compounds, thus detailed spectroscopic analysis was not adequately performed. However, the compounds were believed to be known clerodane diterpenes that have been previously isolated from this and other species of Ajuga.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="subject">Plant Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/9</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hedonistic pricing models and the valuation of intangible assets</field><field name="creator">Cohen, Michael Brian</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the use of hedonic pricing models to value intangible assets that are owned by firms.

The disturbance that occurred over 36 years previously varied from unlogged (controls), through single-tree selection (light), moderate selection and repeated single-tree selection to intensive (heavy) logging. Multivariate and univariate approaches were used to investigate changes in various plant groups, including all vascular plants, regenerating species (trees and understorey species &gt; 1.3 m in height and &lt; 10 cm diameter at 1.3 m above the ground level (dbh)), juvenile trees (regenerating species capable of attaining at least 10 cm dbh), and trees &#161;&#221; 10 cm dbh. In addition, dynamic parameters (recruitment, growth and mortality) were estimated using hierarchical multilevel modelling and parameter estimates used to simulate behaviour of the subtropical rainforest tree species in unlogged and logged stands, both within and beyond the range of available data.Chronological post-disturbance responses and changes in species abundance and richness as well as stand structure for trees &#161;&#221; 10 cm dbh were investigated using 20 PSP in a bid to better understand rainforest post-disturbance regeneration. The results portrayed minor and gradual ecological changes in the undisturbed controls analogous with natural forest dynamics where the changes were not significant. In logged sites, initial gradual changes were followed with more rapid and significant changes.In both unlogged and logged stands, the changes proceeded through three clearly identifiable stages. The first two stages lasted between 5 and 15 years each. In the initial stage, the number of individuals decreased in species with high frequency mainly in the shade tolerant species, with little or no change in species richness. In the second stage, species abundance and richness changed due to localised species turnover, replacement and losses with very little recruitment, and the numbers of both speciesand individuals declined to minima. In the third stage, due to recruitment beyond the 10 cm dbh, the net loss of species and trees &#161;&#221; 10 cm dbh were halted and reversed, and species diversity and abundance began to return to pre-disturbance levels.Species abundance and diversity for both shade tolerant and intolerant species in less intensively logged sites (single-tree selection logging) have recovered to levels comparable with that observed in the controls, but more intensively logged sites have not recovered to similar levels. Increased logging intensity was associated with increased and decreased densities in the shade intolerant and &#168;Ctolerant species respectively. It was evident that stand structure in logged sites had yet to recover to levels comparable with that of unlogged controls. It appears the restoration of floristic diversity to levels similar to that of intact primary forest takes considerably less time than structural recovery. Changes in regeneration patterns in a subtropical rainforest in north-east  New South Wales were investigated for a 13-year period during the 3rd and 4th decades following repeated single-tree selection logging. Multivariate and univariate analyses results showed that there were no significant differences in floristic assemblages within and between censuses; however, two contrasting trends of changes in plant groups were detected. In trees &#161;&#221; 10 cm dbh, the stem density and species richness increased in shade tolerant group, and while stem density increased in the shade intolerant group, species richness decreased during the study period. Amongst smaller sized species including trees (&lt; 10 cm dbh), a general decrease in species richness was observed along with significant changes in stem densities (P = 0.03) with the number of individuals in the shade tolerant species increasing, while that of both shade intolerant and vine species decreased. Excluding the vines and understorey species from the broader regenerating species group, revealed a decrease in species richness in juvenile canopy tree, and a significant change in densities (P = 0.004) with the number of individuals in shade tolerant increasing, while that of shade intolerant trees decreased. A comparison between the canopy trees &#161;&#221; 10 cm dbh and juvenile canopy trees group showed that these groups were tending towards similar floristic assemblages. These results suggest gradual replacement of shade intolerant by shade tolerant species as stands were tending toward later stages of recovery within the regeneration. The results also show that the inclusion of regenerating species in long-term studies is both complementary to the larger plant component and more revealing of both trends and changes.Species-specific estimates of shade tolerance and size structure at maturity derived from observations on 23 plots were used to intuitively group 277 vascular plant species into 3 main groups including full floristic (all together), shade tolerant and intolerant groups. The shade tolerant and intolerant groups were further grouped into smaller plants groups depending on the development stage and maximum size at maturity. These groups included regenerating species, juvenile trees, and trees &#161;&#221; 10 cm dbh. Multivariate analyses of these nominated groups revealed that floristic assemblages were significantly associated with environmental gradients based on simple site characteristics.At the landscape (larger) scale, the floristic assemblages were significantly different between low (200-400), mid (400-700) and high altitude (over 700 meters above sea level). In addition, abundance of shade tolerant species including Doryphora sassafras Endl, Orites excelsa R.Br and Caldcluvia paniculosa (F.Muell) Hoogland was positively correlated with the altitudinal gradient. At the smaller (local) scale, intensively logged sites where large gaps were created had recovered their species richness, but effects of past logging were evident in trees &#161;&#221; 10 cm dbh, especially trees greater than 50 cm dbh where species abundance in shade tolerant decreased significantly. Less intensively logged sites at mid altitude where a few stems were removed had recovered their species richness in respect to trees &#161;&#221; 10 cm dbh, but the small gaps created may have healed quickly for appreciable regeneration response to occur, as juvenile trees component was significantly different to that of the (unlogged) controls.The abundance of shade intolerant and juvenile shade tolerant tree species increased in concert with levels of disturbance and abundance of shade intolerant species such as Duboisia myoporoides R.Br, Acacia melanoxylon R.Br, Rubus moorei F.Muell and R. hilli F.Muell was positively correlated with the disturbance gradient. Increase in number of individuals of certain tree species was positively correlated with both disturbance intensity and topography (mid slope through lower slope to creek/gully), but negatively correlated with aspect (NE - NW). We concluded that logged sites are yet to recover their pre-logging stand structure and rainforest tree species were found in sites where favourable recruitment and growth conditions were the encountered. These results show that logged sites had not yet regenerated to the pre-logging stand structure. They also show that habitat characteristics including history of disturbance and topography can influence the floristic assemblages in the sub-tropical rainforests at both the small (local) and large (geographic) scales. This supports the environmental control model that states &#161;&#176;species are found at sites where they encounter favourable living conditions&#161;&#177;. Site characteristics as surrogate for some of these favourable living conditions were identified as useful potential variables to investigate the rainforest dynamic parameters (growth, recruitment and mortality) in both logged and unlogged stands.A quantitative model was developed using over 3 decades of data to describe and simulate the dynamics including recruitment, growth and mortality in unlogged stands and others subjected to different silvicultural regimes in uneven-aged mixed-species subtropical rainforests of north-eastern New South Wales. Hierarchical multilevel regression analyses including Poisson, Binomial and multinomial logit regression were used to estimate the rainforest dynamic parameters based on the assumption that trees perform differently in space and time, thus there are variations at both the plot and tree by measurement levels.Variations at the tree level required the botanical identity of trees to species level, and then the species-specific size at maturity and shade tolerance were used to classify species into 5 groups, each consisting of species with similar ecological characteristics. These groups were labelled as emergent and shade tolerant main canopy, shade tolerant mid canopy, shade tolerant understoreys, moderate shade tolerant and persistent, and shade intolerant pioneer tree species. Significant variables at the plot level including site characteristics such as topography (elevation, slope and aspect), and past disturbance were used as explanatory variables in species group models. The final model is as a classical matrix management-oriented model with an ecological touch and maximum size-dependent parameters of ingrowth and outgrowth. The model provides a tool to simulate stand performance after logging and to assess silvicultural prescriptions before they are applied in these types of forests.The simulations indicate that full recovery following a logging intensity where 47% of the overstorey basal area is removed with a checkerboard of logged and unlogged patches (group selection) on a 120-year cycle could enable sustainable timber production without compromising the ecological integrity in these forests. Following single-tree selection (33%), recovery takes about 150 years, and more intensive harvesting practices where 50-78% overstorey basal area is removed may take 180-220 years to recover. Pre-harvest climber cutting coupled with poisoning of non-timber species followed by intensive logging of merchantable trees would allow logging on a 300-year cycle. Shorter logging cycles may lead to changes in the forest structure and floristic composition where the overall species density is low with higher density of shade intolerant species.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">modelling dyamics</field><field name="subject">sustainable management</field><field name="subject">rainforests</field><field name="subject">species abundance</field><field name="subject">distubance intensity</field><field name="subject">logging</field><field name="subject">Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Natural Resources Management and Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/27</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Best practice features and practices guiding community service organisation governance</field><field name="creator">Jones, Christopher Randall</field><field name="description">The review of the literature and the results gained from this research suggest an important link between the effectiveness of a board, including its corporate governance practices, and organisational effectiveness. This link attests to the importance of a greater focus upon the governance approach used by organisations. There is extensive literature about corporate governance in the business sector and there is emerging research into corporate governance in the Third Sector. However there is very little literature about the community service component on the Third Sector in Australia and none in relation to community service organisations that are incorporated under the Tasmanian Associations Incorporation Act 1964. This thesis aims to discover what is defined as best practice in the area of corporate governance for Tasmanian community service organisations and if selected organisations have adopted that best practice. For this purpose a research problem and three research sub-problems are identified. The research adopts a case study approach as the main research methodology using interviews, document reviews and a short self assessment questionnaire as data collection tools. The researcher approached six incorporated community service organisations funded by the Tasmanian Department of Health and Human Services and they agreed to participate in the research. Following data collection and data analysis the following major findings emerge. Firstly, that case organisations have adopted a range of governance practices. There are significant gaps in some organisations and there is room for improvement in all of the case organisations. Secondly, that some case organisation boards are approaching corporate governance by managing compliance to a minimum standard although others are offering strategic leadership with a commitment to quality and best practice. Thirdly, the research identifies a number of factors that impact upon corporate governance in case organisations. Those factors include the role of the Chief Executive Officer; the quest for competitive advantage; implementation of governance maintenance strategies and the impact of religion for religious-based organisations. Finally, the research also identifies three factors that were not determinative upon case organisations. They are the size of the organisation, the governance model being used, and the influence of the regulator (the Business Affairs Office) and the funding provider (the Department of Health and Human Services). Consequently it is concluded that the principle based approach to corporate governance can be extended to Tasmania. Furthermore the implication of this research for community sector organisations is that they need to implement governance maintenance practices including board training, board performance review and governance review. There is also a call to both the Business Affairs Office and the Department of Health and Human Services to be more proactive in requiring community service organisations to adopt additional corporate governance practices. Hence, based on the literature review and the analysis of the research data, a list of &#8220;Best practice features and practices guiding community service organisation governance&#8221; has been developed. This list can be used by organisations to provide direction for their approach to corporate governance. Finally, the conclusions provide a solid foundation for further study. This will be useful in order to obtain a broader understanding of the issues involved.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">best practice</field><field name="subject">case study</field><field name="subject">community sector organisations</field><field name="subject">corporate governance</field><field name="subject">Third Sector</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Health and Medical Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/26</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information system success: evaluation of a carbon accounting and sequestration system</field><field name="creator">Smart, William J</field><field name="description">The primary aim of the research conducted for this thesis was to develop a predictive model of information systems success for a publicly-available, web-based application that provides information to users on both the value of carbon credits that result from sequestration of carbon in a forest as well as potential earnings from supply of saleable timber. The application, also developed as part of this research, is called the CO2 Calculator. In addition attitudes of respondents to climate change and carbon sequestration were also gauged to ascertain their knowledge of key environmental issues relevant to the system.The model used as the foundation for the research is the DeLone and McLean (1992, 2002, 2003) model of information systems success. This model was adapted to measure information systems success for the CO2 Calculator which is a publicly available, web-based application rather than a proprietary, task-specific, organizationally focused application as measured in the prior research.Data was collected via a survey dispatched by email to users who accessed the CO2 Calculator. The survey instrument used builds on the existing work of Torkzadeh and Doll (1988, 1999), Seddon and Kiew (1994) and Torkzadeh et al. (2005). All of these researchers used variations of the End User Survey (EUS) to collect data on end users&#8217; perceptions of the success of various applications, all of which were internal, organisationally-focussed, task specific, proprietary systems. This meant the survey items used for the current research were adapted to measure users&#8217; attitudes to a publicly-available, web-based application that had no task-specific roles in an organisation.Analysis of the data proceeded in two distinct phases. The first phase was the examination and presentation of descriptive information about the demographic characteristics of the sample and the users&#8217; attitudes to climate change, carbon sequestration and the overall success of the CO2 Calculator. The descriptive data indicated the respondents are a  technologically literate group who have concerns related to environmental management and the use of land for sustainable practices. It also showed that the users were extremely satisfied with the CO2 Calculator.In the second phase Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was used to examine the constructs underlying the data and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to examine the relationships among the constructs. Both the EFA and SEM resulted in structures and relationships that differed from the hypothesised outcomes and revealed a set of constructs and relationships that were clearly associated with the success of a publicly-available, web based application with different theoretical associations than those found by previous researchers examining organisationally-focussed, proprietary applications.Regression analyses were also conducted to check the relationships among constructs that were omitted from the final structural model, but were on the hypothesised model. Support for their inclusion in further studies was found as the analysis identified that the scales used to measure these constructs were significant predictors of the outcome variables although not when networked with those constructs that were on the final measurement model.Notwithstanding the limitations of the research, it has resulted in the identification of a predictive model of information success for web-based, publicly available, nonorganisationally focused systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Natural Resource Economics</field><field name="subject">Natural Resources Management and Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/84</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forces shaping the trends and patterns of China&#8217;s outbound international tourist flows</field><field name="creator">Tse, Sze Ming</field><field name="description">This study concerns itself with outbound tourist flows from China. It is informed by the interpretive social sciences paradigm, and the research methodology is qualitative and inductive in nature. The study uses secondary data analysis, case study, interview/questionnaire and participant observation to answer the research question &#8220;How are the trends and patterns of China&#8217;s outbound international tourist flows being shaped?&#8221;Secondary-data analysis is used to understand the historical, socio-economic and political context in which China&#8217;s outbound tourism has developed. Case study is used to identify the similarities and differences in policy and international tourist flow patterns in Japan, Taiwan and Korea, and provide a benchmark for studying China&#8217;s outbound tourism.A total of 13 academics and industry practitioners and 22 senior China National Tourism Administration officials were interviewed either in person or via questionnaire, to examine the roles played by the Chinese government in outbound tourism. Information about China&#8217;s outbound tourism and macro environment was collected from six different forums and seminars.Seven different forces in the macro-environment were found to be at play in China&#8217;s outbound tourism, namely competitive, demographic, economic, technological, cultural, natural and political. The study develops the theory that it is the interplay of these forces that shapes the development of outbound tourism. Among the seven forces, political force, or state control, is the strongest at the moment. The thesis has it that the dialectic interaction between the market economy and state control determines the socio-economic framework shaping the trends and patterns of outbound international tourist flows in China.The Chinese government is not ambiguous about the fact that it has a role to play in outbound tourism. That role is not just related to quality of living, a level playing field or economic development, but also national dignity, diplomacy, and international relations. To the Chinese government, stability is of such paramount importance that the country&#8217;s collective interests are emphasised over the interests of the individual, which are associated with social instability and disorder. Therefore, outbound travel by individuals will be allowed to flourish as long as it continues to serve the wider national interest of the country and it does not undermine national stability.How can these findings be of use to destinations? When approaching China as a potential source market, destinations need to take a more holistic approach in order to understand the underlying drivers of its outbound tourism.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/82</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Listening to refugee bodies: The naturopathic encounter as a cross-cultural meeting place</field><field name="creator">Singer, Judy</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the meanings of naturopathy through the experiences of twelve women with refugee backgrounds involved in naturopathic treatment at the Victorian Foundation for Survivors of Torture (Foundation House), a refugee torture and trauma rehabilitation service in Melbourne, Australia. The findings of this research show that the naturopathic encounter provided a transformative and meaningful meeting place for healing, a place in which the women felt at ease and in place.At Foundation House naturopathy has been practised alongside counselling since 1989, two years after the organisation&#8217;s inception. The women I interviewed for this project came from diverse sociocultural backgrounds and a wide range of countries including Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Afghanistan, Somalia, Burma and Serbia.The thesis brings together two contemporary fields of practice: Western models of refugee health care and traditional medicine. It argues for the place of non-biomedical approaches in refugee health care in a Western setting. The thesis takes an interdisciplinary approach to theorise the naturopathic encounter. The distinction between holistic and reductionist perspectives on health, illness and the body is underpinned by the theoretical work of medical anthropologists Nancy Scheper-Hughes and Margaret Lock and that of medical sociologist Aaron Antonovsky. A cultural studies perspective, influenced by the work of embodiment scholar Elspeth Probyn is employed to theorise these women&#8217;s experiences of the naturopathic encounter.This qualitative study is based on in-depth interviews and draws on grounded theory as an approach to data analysis. Descriptions of respite, renewal, and healing in the naturopathic encounter are cited as the most observable themes emerging from the women&#8217;s stories. These themes represent a health-oriented, as opposed to a disease-focused, perspective. Importantly, a health-orientated approach is congruent with the core tenets of naturopathic philosophy. Listening to the body is a crucial therapeutic tool in the naturopathic encounter, where primacy is given to supporting and strengthening health-creating strategies. I argue that this orientation disrupts the existing dominant biomedical approach to refugee health care. I draw on the work of Probyn to theorise the movement from the naturopathic encounter (NE) to the naturopathic meeting place (NMP). Central to this transposition is Probyn&#8217;s articulation of the body&#8217;s awareness of being in and out of place. This awareness lends itself to an understanding of the connectedness between past and present in the bridge-making that these particular refugee women have engaged in across cultures in the NMP.The thesis addresses an important but often neglected focus in refugee research: the resilience and agency of refugees. This positive aspect of refugee recovery is revealed in the research by theorising the women&#8217;s stories through Probyn&#8217;s embodiment analysis and cognisance of the &#8216;everyday&#8217; as a productive and creative process. The research interrupts the ubiquitous image of the &#8216;disempowered refugee victim&#8217;. It highlights the practical wisdom and agency of these particular women that is often overshadowed in the complex resettlement process. It makes a call for further health-orientated research to broaden and deepen our understanding of the refugee experience.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">naturopathy</field><field name="subject">refugee women</field><field name="subject">western herbal medicine</field><field name="subject">traditional medicine</field><field name="subject">refugee health care</field><field name="subject">qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Antonovsky</field><field name="subject">Probyn</field><field name="subject">Habitus</field><field name="subject">medical anthropology</field><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/81</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The human face of organisational change</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Camille Ruth Ann</field><field name="description">This current study investigated a possible extension to existing transformational leadership models used during organisational change programs. Researching the literature provided some preliminary evidence there was a need to include a potential extension to transformational leadership models. The original models of transformational leadership involved looking at the staff members from an organisational perspective, whereas the potential extension, concerns the human aspects of organisational change. The potential new extension consists of four components: communication, team building, stress and coping and inter-group conflict. This possible extension to the transformational leadership models appeared to be an exciting addition as it addresses important human resource issues experienced during organisational change. The present study sought to further investigate whether these four components indeed were warranted and whether its components actually contributed to successful organisational change. The research methodology was exploratory, qualitative and based on a grounded theory approach (Glaser &amp; Strauss 1967). Using an embedded case study method, in-depth convergent interviews were undertaken in four hospitals undergoing considerable organisational change. Twenty-six managers, executives and staff were interviewed. It was found that the change managers themselves were enthusiastic about implementing change but were unable to offer effective support for staff. Staff and managers said that communication within the hospitals during the period of change was poor. Similarly there was a paucity of accurate information being disseminated. Managers and staff also revealed that they had experienced considerable stress during the period of change and they needed help in order to cope effectively. Varying levels of inter-group conflict were reported in all the hospitals studied and managers reported that changes were not being implemented appropriately. However, efforts at team building were non-existent in two of the hospitals studied. These findings provide strong support for managers and leaders to pay increased attention to communication, team building, dealing with conflict and managing stress during times of increased change. This study suggests that a potential extension of the four components could be added to, and thereby strengthen, the transformational leadership models of organisational change.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transformational leadership</field><field name="subject">organisational change</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">team building</field><field name="subject">stress and coping</field><field name="subject">inter-group conflict</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Human Resources Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/24</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Unsaid&#8217; voices of middle-level women nurses&#8217; experience of Western Australian public hospitals: an integrated feminist postmodern ethnography</field><field name="creator">Pannowitz, Helen K</field><field name="description">The context for this research was the socio-political, culturally constructed, lived experience of eight women nurses who held middle-level positions in two Western Australian public hospitals. Glass and Davis&#8217; (1998) integrated feminist postmodern model for nursing research framed the design for the ethnographic investigation.The researcher used an innovative self-developed trifocality method: realist; critical feminist; and feminist postmodern to critique ethnographic data against the research aim and objectives and reflexively engaged with the women nurses to reveal unacknowledged individual and collective insights. Participant observation, critical conversation, and reflective field/journaling were used as triangulated data collection methods. The methodology revealed the local, particular, historical, taken-for-granted and traditionally gender-biased subjugated voices of individual women nurses as legitimate sites for the production of knowledge and insights.The trifocal data analysis revealed multiple intersecting layers of meanings and insights. The participants unacknowledged &#8216;unsaid&#8217; experiences were viewed as exemplar &#8216;states of being&#8217;, or subjectivity positions, of their multiple and temporal realities. Inherent within the subjectivity positions was their personal, professional and corporate efforts, assumed as self-managing strategies and implicit knowledge, to enact work roles.Deeper critique, applying feminist poststructuralism (Lather 1991b) and postmodern notions of power/knowledge networks of relationships (Foucault 1980b) revealed three competing socio-political culturally constructed discourses. Firstly, the participants&#8217; were embedded within an empowering &#8216;Discourse of Values Attributed to Nursing/Between a Rock and a Hard Place&#8217;. Secondly, they were influenced by, and resistant to the patriarchally dominant &#8216;Discourse of Bureaucratic Managerialism Discourse/Absence of Care&#8217;.  thirdly, they functioned within the influence of the disempowering &#8216;Discourse Medical Science/Working the Margins&#8217;.This research contributes to the knowledge base of scholarly work that exists about nurses, women nurses specifically, concerning the meaning of the experiences of practicing in the confluence of corporate and professional responsibilities. At the personal participant level the insights contribute to emancipatory consciousness-raising. The insights also positively contribute to the recommendations made in The Report of the Western Australian Study of Nursing and Midwifery (Pinch &amp; Della 2001). The insights may evoke wider awareness of the disempowering influence of managerialism upon professional practice and inter-professional relationships. Finally, the unique trifocal data analysis method contributes to the body of nursing and social science research knowledge.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">post moderism</field><field name="subject">ethnograohy</field><field name="subject">corporate management</field><field name="subject">public hospital</field><field name="subject">emancipatory qualitative methodology</field><field name="subject">professional clinical specialist</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/64</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting the achievement of success in e-tailing in China&#8217;s retail industry: a case study of the Shanghai Brilliance Group</field><field name="creator">Xuan, Weibing</field><field name="description">The rapid growth of the internet and e-commerce provide new opportunities for China&#8217;s retailers, and a new battle for China&#8217;s retail industry has begun. The purpose of this research is to explore the barriers and factors for achieving successful e-tailing in China&#8217;s retail industry. Some past studies have investigated the success of e-commerce in the western context. This study aims to partially fill the gap created by the lack of research into e-commerce in the Asian context, by investigating successful e-tailing in China&#8217;s retail industry, and is based on a case study of the Shanghai Brilliance Group. Therefore, the research question is &#8216;How can successful e-tailing in China&#8217;s retail industry be achieved?&#8217; Accordingly, three research issues are addressed:Research issue 1: How is e-tailing being used in the Shanghai Brilliance Group?Research issue 2: What are the barriers to the implementation of e-tailing in theShanghai Brilliance Group?Research issue 3: What are the factors for achieving successful e-tailing in theShanghai Brilliance Group?To investigate the research question and the three research issues, the following approaches were applied. Firstly, three parent disciplines were reviewed, namely, ecommerce, retail in China, and e-tailing success factors, in order to generate the research gap and a theoretical model. A theoretical model was developed, which included six factors and their variables. These six factors are: senior management factors, organisational factors, e-commerce strategies, external factors, consumer factors, and ecommerce system measurements. Secondly, the primary data for this research were collected from interviews (16 in-depth interviews and 3 focus group interviews) and a survey questionnaire (200 valid questionnaires).The findings for the first research issue showed that e-commerce is poorly implemented in the Shanghai Brilliance Group and its subsidiaries, but that e-commerce in the supermarket subsidiaries is more advanced than in the department stores. Only one department store is offering online shopping to their customers, while both supermarket subsidiaries offer online shopping. The rest of the department stores only use websites for advertising and promotion, or for limited customer service, such as award point checking. Moreover, only the Oriental Shopping Centre and Lian Hua Supermarket have specific teams or an out-sourced company controlling their e-commerce project. This shows that e-commerce is not being taken seriously in the Shanghai Brilliance Group to date.In relation to the second research issue, a total of nineteen barriers were identified from the interview data. Those barriers can be divided into two categories, namely, external barriers and internal barriers. Most of those barriers are consistent with those mentioned in the literature. However, some new barriers emerged from the data analysis process, including the mission of the organisation, and high profit objectives.The findings in relation to research issue 3 identified other important factors of e-tailing, besides those barriers answered in research issue 2. Most of the success factors reviewed in the literature were confirmed by the collected data and in addition, some new variables were explored. Overall, six groups of factors and 64 variables were addressed in this research as success factors for e-tailing. This included 57 out of the 59 variables which were previously mentioned in the literature and seven emergent variables.This research has made a contribution to both the theory and practice of e-tailing.Through qualitative analysis, this research not only identifies the important factors of e-tailing, but also generates a comprehensive model to guide the implementation of e-tailing by China&#8217;s retailers, especially the Shanghai Brilliance Group. Furthermore, this is the first study to investigate successful e-tailing in China&#8217;s retail industry. Accordingly, the proposed framework of this study provides a foundation for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">e-tailing</field><field name="subject">China retail industry</field><field name="subject">success factors</field><field name="subject">case study</field><field name="subject">E-Commerce</field><field name="subject">International Business</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/49</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The contribution of internship in developing industry-relevant management competencies in tourism and hospitality graduates</field><field name="creator">Walo, Maree Ann</field><field name="description">Industry practitioners and educators both agree that tourism and hospitality management curricula need to reflect recent and future industry needs and developments, to ensure graduates are equipped with appropriate and industry-relevant skills. Furthermore, the combination of theory with practice is viewed as an essential component of a student&#8217;s tourism and hospitality management education. In the past, limited attempts have been made to provide empirical support to claims that a practical internship experience develops management competence in tourism and hospitality management students. In addition, Australian research into the management competencies employers in tourism and hospitality industries expect of recent graduates is minimal. Given the proliferation of tourism and hospitality-related courses over the past decade and the relative importance attributed to internship in developing students&#8217; management competencies, such evaluations are considered important.Thus, this study focused on three main research objectives which were; to identify the management competencies that managers of organisations within tourism and hospitality industries expect of recent tourism and hospitality graduates; to determine whether students&#8217; management competencies are developed during the internship component of Southern Cross University&#8217;s Bachelor of Business in Tourism degree; and to determine whether the management competencies of Southern Cross University&#8217;s Bachelor of Business in Tourism students meet the expectations of selected managers of organisations in four tourism and hospitality sectors. The study utilised the 24 management competencies and eight roles of Quinn, Thompson, Faerman and McGrath&#8217;s (1990) Competing Values Framework (CVF) to test two research hypotheses. The first hypothesis proposed that students&#8217; pre-internship mean scores will be significantly lower than their post-internship mean scores with respect to the 24 management competencies and eight managerial roles associated with Quinn et al.&#8217;s (1990) Competing Values Framework. The second hypothesis proposed that students&#8217; post-internship mean scores will not be significantly lower than the selected managers&#8217; mean scores with respect to the 24 management competencies and eight managerial roles associated with Quinn et al.&#8217;s (1990) Competing Values Framework. A specific survey instrument, the Self Assessment of Managerial Skills (DiPadova, 1990), was used to survey managers within four sectors of Australian tourism and hospitality industries and Bachelor of Business in Tourism internship students from Southern Cross University in Lismore, Australia. Students were surveyed before and after internship.The study found that students&#8217; perceptions of their level of managerial competence had significantly increased after the completion of their internship placement in six of the 24 management competencies and three of the eight managerial roles, thus partially supporting the first research hypothesis. Further, it was found that pre-internship, students perceived these six competencies were their weakest competency areas, with one exception - Presenting Information by Writing Effectively. This suggests that internship has complemented competencies developed during their coursework. The study also found that after completing internship, students&#8217; perceptions of their managerial competence were reasonably congruent with the expectations of this sample of managers, thus supporting the second research hypothesis. In this study students&#8217; post-internship competencies were found to be reasonably aligned with Quinn, Faerman and Dixit&#8217;s (1987) research which examined the relationship between management competencies and hierarchical levels in an organisation. Empirical data collected from the students and the managers, identified students&#8217; management profiles preand post-internship and the management profile that managers expect of recent graduates.  These profiles resembled Quinn&#8217;s (1991) description of a Master Manager. These findings suggest that internship has assisted students in moving closer to the competence required of a Master Manager.The study concludes that the internship component of a student&#8217;s tourism and hospitality education can hold real educational benefits in preparing them for future management roles. Also, as entry level graduates, this cohort of students has the ability to demonstrate competence over a range of transferable generic management competencies and should be effectively equipped to undertake a range of managerial opportunities that may be presented to them. The study demonstrates the importance of conducting empirically based evaluation to provide support to the debate on the true educational value of internship and highlights the need for further research in this area. It also demonstrates the application of the eight management roles and 24 management competencies of the CVF (Quinn et al., 1990) to tourism and hospitality industries.With the recent proliferation of tourism and hospitality management programs, tertiary education providers are now being held more accountable for the courses they offer. Curricula must reflect the changing needs of industry. Research in collaboration with tourism and hospitality industries must continue to ensure that courses offered are not only relevant but are also producing graduates with skills and knowledge they will need as future managers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">management competencies</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">hospitality</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Hospitality Administration and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/48</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growth of eucalyptus pellita in mixed species and monoculture plantations</field><field name="creator">Bristow, Mila</field><field name="description">Eucalyptus pellita is a commercially important plantation hardwood species for the humid tropics of north Queensland. This species is favoured by both small-scale growers for use in mixed species woodlots targeting low-volume high-value sawn timber, and also by industrial forest companies growing monocultures for integrated pulp &#8211; sawn timber regimes. This study investigated whether mixed-species designs can increase the growth of this tropical eucalypt when compared to monocultures.A replacement series experiment with monocultures of Eucalyptus pellita (E) and Acacia peregrina (A) and mixtures in various proportions (75E:25A, 50E:50A, 25E:75A) was used to examine questions about growth and productivity. The trial was located on the Atherton Tablelands of north Queensland, Australia. High mortality in the establishment phase due to repeated damage by tropical cyclones altered the trial design. Effects of experimental designs on tree growth were estimated using a linear mixed effects model with restricted maximum likelihood analysis (REML). Volume growth of individual eucalypt trees were positively affected by the presence of acacia trees at age five years and this effect generally increased with time up to age 10 years. However, the stand volume and basal area increased with increasing proportions of E. pellita, due to its larger individual tree size. Conventional analysis did not offer convincing support for mixed-species designs. Preliminary individual-based modelling using a modified Hegyi competition index offered a solution and an equation that indicates acacias have positive ecological interactions (facilitation or competitive reduction), and definitely do not cause competition like E. pellita. These results suggest that significantly increased growth rates could be achieved with mixed-species designs over E. pellita monocultures. This statistical methodology could enable a better 4 understanding of species interactions in similarly altered experiments, or undesigned mixed-species plantations.The effects of trees on soils are highly variable and highly site and species specific. That trees can change soil chemistry over time is well established. The soil chemical properties under the eucalypt: acacia experiment were compared to several potential baseline data sources: the reference description of this soil type; those measured at 7 months after planting; and with those of soils under two adjacent vegetation types (forest and pasture) when the experiment was aged 9 years. At 9 years after planting soil total nitrogen increased with increasing proportion of acacias in the treatment. The mean total N under the acacia monoculture was significantly higher (P = 0.041) than that of either the eucalypt monoculture, or the surrounding pasture. The proportion of acacia in the treatment was positively linearly correlated with soil total N (r2 = 0.46; P = 0.018). Soils under the eucalypt monocultures were more similar to those under pasture for a range of soil chemical properties, compared with soils under treatments containing acacias. Results from this site show that the two species alter the soil chemistry in different ways. It is possible that the increased total N under the acacias could be facilitating the growth of the E. pellita, however without n-fixation analysis or tissue sampling it is not possible to confirm that the eucalypt is using the N. Similar cause and effect (or &#8216;supply and use&#8217;) questions also remain for soil pH and available phosphorus changes with increasing acacia in treatment. This study also demonstrates the difficulty in monitoring changes in soil properties over long cycles of forest plantations.The photosynthetic response to light was assessed in the stratified canopy of the mixed species field trial of the eucalypt: acacia experiment, and among commonly planted taxa of E. pellita in glasshouse pot trials. In the field trial photosynthetic capacity of fully5 expanded sun and shade leaves of both species was measured. E. pellita has a wide natural distribution with considerable variation in morphology and growth within the species, with several provenances commonly planted in north Queensland. Photosynthetic capacity and leaf nutrient content of three of these taxa (two from northern occurrences and one from southern occurrences of E. pellita) were measured on two occasions in glasshouse pot trials. A non rectangular hyperbolic function was used to describe the light response curves, and analysis of variance was used to determine differences in the biologically relevant curve parameters between treatments. In the field trial sun and shade leaves of E. pellita produced similar light saturated photosynthetic rates, and experienced little competition for light from the acacia crowns. In contrast there was significant variation in the photosynthetic response between acacia sun and shade leaves. In the glasshouse trials, differences in leaf and petiole morphology were observed, which were coupled with differences in leaf nutrient content and highly significant variation in light saturated photosynthetic rate between the three taxa. This study characterised the light response of E. pellita and suggests that differences in physiological responses to resource availability should be expected among taxa within this species, which may be important for forest productivity models which endeavour to predict tree growth and resource use.An empirical model of growth of E. pellita from a designed monocultures vs. mixedspecies experiment has been used to explore system behaviour rather than predict production of this species from specific forests. This approach has allowed examination of the effect of plantation design on competition, soil nutrient pool change with time and physiological responses to light; leading to a greater understanding of why mixtures can lead to greater productivity than monocultures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eucalyptus pellita</field><field name="subject">monoculture plantations</field><field name="subject">timber</field><field name="subject">Forest Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/75</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical study into factors influencing the use of value-based management tools</field><field name="creator">Sakunasingha, Benjalux</field><field name="description">For management to perform its functions of planning, organizing, leading and controlling effectively, a control process has to be in place. This control process  should incorporate a target or standard measures and compares performance with the standard, evaluates results and takes any necessary corrective action. Hence, the introduction of the control process, including the measurement and evaluation of performance, has been recognized as a significant progression to ensure organizations achieve their objectives and goals.There are a number of performance measurement tools for management to select but one that stands out as possibly the preferred method is Value-based management (VBM). Value-based management, a relatively new concept, offers management a better way to measure performance in today&#8217;s business environment. The application of VBM links business strategy, finance, performance measurement and management processes all together to create value. VBM tells how the value of an organization is maximized, while developing corporate value is the best long-term measure to show how good the present management is doing its job. Therefore, VBM indicates the current situation as well as future prospects of an organization. Further, VBM helps managers and employees to obtain a sharper focus of the corporate vision and objectives based on one leading measurement indicator &#8211; that is to enhance corporate value. Unlike many performance measurement tools that may focus on many objectives, which may cause the lack of single focus for accountability for shareholder value, VBM provides a clearer objective focusing on the financial objectives across the organization. More importantly, VBM includes the cost of all capital required, while many performance measurement tools still provide incomplete information about cost.The purpose of this research is to study what organization factors influence the choice of performance measurement tools, such as VBM selected by management. This research also studies the manner in which the selection and the use of VBM might affect the performance of organizations in Thailand. A number of studies were made in the past dealing with the effectiveness of VBM.These studies analyzed how VBM assisted management in their administration and measurement of organizational activities. These researches add significantly to the body of knowledge and advance the concept of VBM. However, most researchers ignored an important aspect and that is, what factors influence the management to select and utilize VBM tools in their organization. This research attempts to address this knowledge gap, and answer the following questions: &#8226; What are the organization factors that could influence the selection and the use of VBM tools to measure organization performance? Then importantly,&#8226; Do the selection and the use of VBM tools improve organization performance?To examine and to properly evaluate the above questions, this research study identifies four key objectives. First, factors that influence management in selecting value based management tools to measure performance and set standards are to be identified. Second, identify the relationship between organization performance, the use of VBM and certain organization factors such as organization size, market share position and product life cycle stages. Third, study the impact of VBM on organization performance in the Thai environment. Fourth, provide information on how VBM is selected and used in the electrical and electronic industry in Thailand.The following three hypotheses were proposed to study the behaviour of variables:Hypothesis 1: Organization factors are not the determining factors for selecting and using VBM tools for performance measurement.Hypothesis 2: VBM tool selected and used by an organization do not influence its organization performance.Hypothesis 3: The relationship between organization factors and organization performance are not mediated by the VBM tools selected and used by an organization to measure organization performance.To test the hypotheses empirically, a mailed-survey questionnaire was used to collect data. A stratified sampling technique on a population of 462 Head of Finance/Accounting Departments of the Electrical and Electronics Industry of Thailand was employed. The above hypotheses were tested using several analytical techniques including regression model, correlation coefficient and factor analysis.The result of this research indicates that none of the chosen organization factors studied directly influences the selection and the use of VBM tools. In addition, the findings indicated a significant relationship between independent variables, which are organization size and market share position. But these two factors do not establish significantly relationship with the VBM or an organization performance. Further, although the product life cycle stage was not a factor that influenced the selection and the use of VBM tools, it showed a significant negative relationship with organization performance. This was regardless of whether or not the organization selected and used VBM tools. This indicates that the selection and the use of VBM tools are less preferable when the product of an organization is at the early stages such as emerging and growth stages. On the other hand, VBM tools are more preferred by an organization when its product reaches maturity. Finally, these research findings demonstrate that the selection and the use of VBM tools are significantly related to an improvement in organization performance. In other words, the performance of an organization improved with the use of the VBM tool.It is believed that this research is a first attempt to delineate factors that influence management to select and utilize VBM tools in their organizations. One nation, Thailand and one Industry, the electrical and electronic industry were used as the laboratory to test the hypotheses. It is hoped that future research will replicate this study in other industries and countries that would help to confirm the results of this study. Such studies will not only substantiate this research but also offer new insights into understanding the factors influencing the selection and the use of VBM tools. Different organizational factors, different performance measurement tools, and/or different methodologies in conducting the research showed further contribute to knowledge in this area. The research opportunities are considerable, especially in relation to cross-country comparisons based on performance measurements, using VBM tools and it is this type of research that will improve our understanding of the subject and lead to adoption of these measures in organizations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">financial performance</field><field name="subject">performance measurement</field><field name="subject">organization performance</field><field name="subject">value creation</field><field name="subject">value based management</field><field name="subject">VBM</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Management Sciences and Quantitative Methods</field><field name="subject">Organizational Behavior and Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/39</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The philanthropic contract: building social  capital through corporate social investment</field><field name="creator">Cooke, David</field><field name="description">This study investigates the relationship between profit-making corporations and the not-for-profit sector within Australia. The broad field of corporate social responsibility, or CSR, is discussed, narrowing to the activity of corporate philanthropy and corporate social investment. The latter is defined as being philanthropy with strategic intent, in order to build capacity within the recipient organisation which in most cases will produce beneficial outcomes for the donor as well (Tracey, 2003). The title of this study has used the term &#8216;philanthropic contract&#8217; (Broadbent, 2001; Kouzmin, 2007) to describe the relationship between commercial organisations and charitable ones and the unwritten societal expectation, that the corporate sector will support the work of members of the not-for-profit sector. This study also uses the term &#8216;social capital&#8217; (Putnam, 1995) to describe one of the principle areas of benefit for companies who participate.The aspect of the relationship between the two sectors that formed the focus of this study is defined as being the interaction between the two that involves financial contributions and those of goods and services as well as expertise, information and influence flowing from profit-making companies to not-for-profit organisations.The direction of the research is to advance toward an understanding of why corporations engage in this practice and toward a conclusion as to whether corporate social investing is a mutually beneficial exchange. Finally, the study highlights examples of engagement processes, and advice from those participating. The inclusion of these in the study is designed to provide valuable learning for other corporations, and not-for-profit organisations, contemplating entering into their own philanthropic partnerships.Through ten qualitative interviews this inquiry investigated the attitudes toward this relationship of various stakeholders including the management of not-for-profit organisations, representatives of relevant associations and social commentators. It became apparent that the previously well-publicised opposition to publicly listed companies supporting the not-for-profit sector, proffered by organisations such as the Australian Shareholders&#8217; Association, had largely evaporated.Case studies involving five profit-making corporations, operating within Australia, were then undertaken and the views of their senior management sought as regards their motivations, aims, and outcomes. Overwhelmingly their experiences were positive for the corporation, the organisations they were funding, and the members of the community that the recipients were in turn supporting.Corporate benefits reported included increased ability to attract quality staff, enhanced ability to retain staff, significant development for staff that actively participated, improved corporate culture and the building of social capital leading to enhanced reputation which supported the corporations licence to operate, future objectives and long term sustainability.It is hoped that these insights along with the advice offered up by those individuals and organisations that participated in the study will benefit others and promote greater participation in corporate philanthropy and social investment within Australia. vii</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corporate social responsibility</field><field name="subject">corporate social investment</field><field name="subject">corporate philanthropy</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/72</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of paralegalism in Australia, the United States of America and England and Wales</field><field name="creator">Cowley, Jill Irene</field><field name="description">This thesis entitled, A Comparative Study of Paralegalism in Australia, the United States of America and England and Wales, examines the role that paralegals play in the delivery of legal services and the educational opportunities that are available to support that role in Australia as compared to England (and Wales) and the United States of America (US). As in other parts of the common law world it is accepted in Australia that not all work which is of a legal nature is performed by qualified legal practitioners. This is despite a rigid demarcation between qualified lawyers and other legal workers. The structure and regulation of the legal profession have an impact in determining the nature of paralegalism in Australia. The legal profession&#8217;s monopoly in Australia is, however, confined to the right of appearance in a court of law and to the preparation of certain documents for reward, which leaves a vast field of legal tasks open to performance by other workers, including paralegals. The legal profession is facing many challenges in the twenty first century, including the need to deliver better and cheaper legal services. Paralegals, as part of the legal service industry, are affected by the same tensions but are well placed to contribute to a more &#8220;streamlined&#8221; practice and to assist in providing greater access to justice for many disadvantaged Australians.This thesis explores the difficulties for Australian paralegals given that there is little formal recognition of, or status accorded to, the paraprofession. Indeed, the word paralegal is not easily understood nor widely used and this translates into uncertainties as to qualifications, market position and function to provide a definition and to determine the parameters of the profession. Paralegals work in a variety of legal environments which include, but are not limited to, working in private legal practices where they are supervised by lawyers.Further, in order to achieve recognition and to make a meaningful contribution to legal service delivery, paralegals require specialist education. This thesis examines the educational opportunities which are available to paralegals in Australia and makes recommendations as to future accreditation based on appropriate qualifications and experience.In order to gain further insight, comparisons are made between the role that paralegals play in the delivery of legal services in two other common law jurisdictions and Australia. Paralegals play a significant role in the delivery of legal services in the US, where many states constitute bigger jurisdictions than the whole of the Australia. American paralegalism has a twenty year &#8220;head start&#8221; on that of Australia and it is reasonable to anticipate that their challenges will mirror ours in the future. England, on the other hand, has a legal system very close to our own and the examination of paralegals in both England and Wales has revealed both similarities and differences to our Australian experience, both of which inform the research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">paralegal</field><field name="subject">paralegals &#8211; Australia</field><field name="subject">paralegals - United States</field><field name="subject">paralegals - England and Wales</field><field name="subject">legal executives</field><field name="subject">legal assistants</field><field name="subject">access to justice</field><field name="subject">Law</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/53</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Grey matters: does Bacopa monnieri improve memory performance in older persons</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Annette Kay</field><field name="description">Background This thesis investigated the efficacy and safety of Bacopa monnieri in improving memory in healthy Australians over the age of 55-years. A review of the literature showed that memory impairment and dementia are increasingly prevalent in the current demographic climate of an ageing population. As well as the pathological cognitive loss of neurodegenerative disease, many older persons are experiencing memory loss as part of the physiological process of ageing.  Bacopa monnieri is a herbal medicine used since antiquity in the traditional Ayurvedic medical system of India for its cognitive enhancing effects. A number of pre-clinical and clinical studies support this traditional usage. Laboratory studies have demonstrated antioxidant and cholinergic actions in the brain as well as improved memory and cognitive performance in animal models.  Human trials of Bacopa have also demonstrated improved memory performance. Some of these trials are limited by methodological flaws such as lack of blinding, small sample sizes, or use of outcome measurements which are not well validated. However, a small number of well designed human trials provide evidence for efficacy in cognitive and memory performance improvement. The current study was employed to extend on previous findings by assessing the efficacy and safety of Bacopa in the aged population specifically, as it is in this population that memory impairment becomes apparent.  Aims 1. To assess the efficacy of Bacopa monnieri in improving memory in healthy Australians over the age of 55-years. 2. To assess whether the use of Bacopa is associated with side-effects  Design A 12-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical trial.  Participants Participants were self selected from the general population. They were aged 55-years or over at the commencement of the trial. Participants were without dementia, depression or other serious health conditions and did not use psychotropic medications.  Intervention Participants were randomised to one of two treatment conditions, either a tableted extract of Bacopa monnieri called Bacomind&#8482; (300mg/day, standardised to contain at least 40% bacosides), or an identical placebo.  Participants attended three clinical evaluations: the first an initial screening session, the second a baseline evaluation of neuropsychological function and subjective memory performance at the commencement of the trial and the third, an end-of-trial outcome evaluation at 12-weeks, during which neuropsychological function and subjective memory performance were again assessed along with side-effects and study compliance.  Primary Outcome Measures Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (CFT), Memory Complaint Questionnaire (MAC-Q), and Trail Making Test (TMT)  Results From 136 people who elected to participate, 103 people met study entry criteria and 98 of these commenced the trial. Of these, 81 participants completed the trial and provided evaluable data for the end point analysis. Bacopa monnieri versus placebo significantly improved verbal learning as well as delayed recall as measured by the AVLT (p&lt;.05). Though improvements were noted in the CFT, MAC-Q and TMT, there were no significant differences between placebo and active groups found for these tests. The Bacopa group reported a higher incidence of gastro-intestinal (GIT) side-effects than the placebo group, these predominantly being increased stool frequency, abdominal cramps and nausea. No other significant adverse effects were found.  Conclusions A clinical trial was carried out to assess the effects of 12-weeks administration of Bacopa monnieri (300mg/day) on memory performance in people over the age of 55-years. Primary outcome measures were well validated neuropsychological tests that objectively measured verbal and visual memory and a memory complaint questionnaire that measured subjective memory complaints.  The results demonstrated that Bacopa significantly improved memory acquisition and retention in older Australians. This concurs with findings from previous human and animal studies, as well as supports traditional Ayurvedic claims and uses. The beneficial effects on memory observed may be due to previously demonstrated antioxidant and cholinergic effects of the herb on the central nervous system.  The use of Bacopa was associated with GIT side-effects, particularly increased bowel movements, nausea and abdominal cramping, findings infrequently reported previously. Possible explanations for these side-effects include GIT irritation by the saponin constituents of the herb, or cholinergic stimulation of autonomic and motor responses in the GIT, or a combination of both of these factors. The side-effects observed in the current study provide supportive evidence that Bacopa may increase cholinergic activity in humans.  A worthwhile future extension of the current study would be to assess whether the finding of Bacopa&#8217;s efficacy for improving memory performance is replicable in populations with either mild cognitive impairment or early dementia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bacopa monnieri</field><field name="subject">Brahmi</field><field name="subject">Bacopa</field><field name="subject">memory improvement</field><field name="subject">memory performance</field><field name="subject">cognitive improvement</field><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="subject">Natural Products Chemistry and Pharmacognosy</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/59</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of evolutionary history and population structure for the analysis of quantitative trait loci in the ancient conifer Araucaria cunninghamii</field><field name="creator">Scott, Leon J</field><field name="description">Araucaria cunninghamii is an ancient tropical conifer with substantial value as a forestry species in Australia and Papua New Guinea, and has been subject to a genetic improvement program for more than 50 years. This study was undertaken to demonstrate the utility of quantitative genetic analysis in describing the genetic architecture of commercial traits in A. cunninghamii. Linkage maps were prepared using the pseudotestcross strategy in what was believed to be a wide interprovenance cross using microsatellites and AFLP. A very low rate of marker polymorphism and limited differentiation between the parental provenances was identified, resulting in low mapping efficiency. The population genetic structure of A. cunninghamii was assessed to establish the underlying causes for the limited differentiation and low marker heterozygosity and assess the implications for future analysis of quantitative traits.  Despite the limited mapping efficiency, genetic maps were generated for both parents. The maternal map for individual H15 contained 14 linkage groups comprising of 51 AFLP and one microsatellite. The map covered 1290 cM, representing 89% of the estimated genome size. The paternal map for individual Gil24 was 633 cM, consisting of eight linkage groups.  Genetic architecture of quantitative traits was examined with putative QTL identified for height, DBH and stem straightness; one was highly significant (p&lt;0.01), three significant (0.01&lt;p&lt;0.05) and 13 suggestive (p&lt;0.10). Significant QTL each accounted for 7-11% of the phenotypic variance with a high allele substitution effect (0.63-0.81). These QTL were likely to be associated with genes of moderate effect. The suggestive QTL each accounted for 3-6% of the phenotypic variance with an allele substitution effect of 0.40-0.63. Three genomic regions contributed to the expression of multiple traits at multiple ages. Stable QTL had decreasing phenotypic effects with increasing age.  The population genetic survey characterised low levels of allelic diversity across the geographic range. Three broad regions were characterised; Papua New Guinea, Cape York and northern Queensland to NSW. There was limited differentiation between provenances within these regions, and high diversity within provenances. Limited genetic differentiation between provenances seems to be the result of genetic stability due to long overlapping generations, limited founder effects and a very low mutation rate. The latter may also contribute the low heterozygosity. Limited marker polymorphism and limited differentiation between provenances within broad regions are common features in A. cunninghamii. Therefore careful parental selection and alternative experimental approaches will be required before undertaking further analysis of quantitative traits.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Araucaria</field><field name="subject">hoop pine</field><field name="subject">forestry</field><field name="subject">tree breeding</field><field name="subject">evolution</field><field name="subject">population genetics</field><field name="subject">conifer</field><field name="subject">linkage map</field><field name="subject">genetic mapping</field><field name="subject">Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</field><field name="subject">Plant Breeding and Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/52</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How and why credibility-based company logos are effective in marketing communication in persuading customers to take action: a multiple case study toward a better understanding of creativity in branding</field><field name="creator">Haig, William</field><field name="description">This thesis continues to explore guidelines for logo designers to more effectively plan and create company logos. Also, how the current low trust in company Web Sites can be improved with the company logo. Credibility-based logo design is introduced as the underlying principle for both logo design and Web Site improvement. As such, this thesis explores the application of source credibility studies in communication persuasion to the planning and creative development of company logos. Credibility-based logo design theory is developed in a multiple case study which includes applying credibility-based logo design to improve the effectiveness of company Web Sites. The study has two stages. The inductive stage of this case study develops the credibility-based logo design theory, including actual development of company logos based on this theory. The deductive stage tests credibility-based logo design using the Internet and Web analytics for data collection. The research accomplishes two purposes: 1.     To validate credibility-based logo design theory for marketing communication persuasion effectiveness. 2.     To validate that credibility-based logo design will increase the effectiveness of company Web Sites by giving the visitor trust and confidence in the company to take desired action toward a purchase decision. The case study results support the hypothesis that credibility-based logo design theory can be applied to creating more effective company logo design. And, company Web Sites with a credibility-based logo design are twice to four times more effective compared to Web Sites with a non-credible logo. &#8216;More effective&#8217; means more clickthrough action on the Web Site navigation bar to achieve various company goals, most often a purchase decision. In summary, there are two major contributions: 1.      Advancing the knowledge of company logo design through effective logo planning and design creativity based on source-credibility principles. 2.      Advancing the knowledge of Web Site effectiveness through a company credibility-based logo design. A third contribution is in advancing the knowledge for using the Internet to conduct &#8216;live action&#8217; research and data collection. This has further implications for testing Internet advertising and other visual on-line and off-line marketing elements. The results of this study are important for logo designers, company managers, and Web Site designers. As an epilogue, this thesis extends the credibility basis for creating logos to creating all marketing communication to achieve a total brand personality as credible for a given company. This is termed Brand Credibility with implications for a better measurement of brand equity. This thesis builds on the important logo design work by Pamela Henderson, Joseph Cote and Jim Hutton; and the important branding work of David Aaker, Kevin Lane Keller, Jennifer Aaker, and Tulin Erdem.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Advertising and Promotion Management</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/6</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of shifts in strategic orthodoxy on international enterprise performance</field><field name="creator">Lim, Kwee Nan</field><field name="description">This deductive-hypothetico research addressed a literature void on the research problem: Impact of Shifts in Strategic Othodoxy on International Enterprise Performance. This study hypothesised: H11: Strategic orientation correlates with superior international performance; H12: Global strategy contributes to superior performance internationally; and, H13: Skills in strategy execution lead to superiior performance internationally. Three hundred and nine variables in three hypotheses were tested with data collected from a 'small,' but highly relevant sample. Ninety-two variables were positively correlated while 217 were negative. Due to the large number of variables for each hypothesis, no hypothesis was fully supported or rejected. Eleven models for superior international performance have been scientifically developed from data analyses. Models are designed to aid robust international franchising stategy development by strategists at varying continuum of international expertise. Significant serendipitous findings include: nullification of conventional wisdom that the larger the sample size, the higher the reliability the research findings; lateral instead of dedicated strategies can be more effective, in this instance, marketing strategy had no positive correlation with dependent marketing variables but correlated positively with financial variables; and, cost of Australian international franchising operations was determined. A cross sectional research in 2007 will degrade with passage of time. Environmental dynamics will affect its relevance. This study concerns Australian international franchisors, hence generalizability outside this dimension may not be appropriate. Contribution of this research to knowledge is significant: outcomes filled a literature void in relation to the research problem; findings of positively correlated variables help franchising strategists develop strategies that achieve superior performance, whereas negatively correlated variables help avoid costly mistakes; and, the research refuted previous postulations that fundamentals of western management were flawed. Culminating from this research, a window of opportunities has been created for further research in various areas such as varying types or research; methodologies; sectoral and geographical variations; and changes in research scope and width.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">international franchising</field><field name="subject">unorthodox orientation</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">International Business</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/4</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcultural teachers: experiences of academics teaching tourism and hospitality in multicultural and transnational contexts</field><field name="creator">Witsel, Mieke</field><field name="description">The rapid growth in internationalisation of education has led to the point where Australia has become a world leader in transnational education. Simultaneously, the provision of hospitality and tourism management education has developed rapidly from its inception in 1974 with numbers of international students rising steadily. Although robust research into the international student experience has been conducted, the impact of these changes upon tertiary academics has received little attention from researchers.  Within this context, this research project aims to develop a better understanding of academics&#8217; experiences of teaching tourism and hospitality in transcultural settings. More specifically, the study seeks to discover the impacts of working in a multicultural, multinational and multilingual environment on the tourism and hospitality academic (Objective One), and to explore the concept of competence in multicultural and transnational teaching (Objective Two). This thesis is presented in five stages. The first stage considers the formative background to the research, and explores literature and concepts surrounding transcultural contexts of higher education. The current state of internationalisation of tourism and hospitality higher education in Australia is outlined, and gaps in the research field are highlighted. This section observes a need for transcultural competence in teaching. Stage Two addresses methodological considerations and explores the use of interpretive phenomenological methodology for gaining a greater understanding of the lived experiences of academics teaching in transcultural contexts. The practice and philosophies surrounding phenomenology, interviewing, and transcribing talk are critically examined. This stage also proposes the use of mind mapping as a tool for qualitative research analysis. Employing the interpretive methodologies outlined in the previous stage, Stage Three considers Objective One by addressing the research question &#8216;What are the concerns and constraints experienced by academics teaching in transnational and multicultural contexts?&#8217; In keeping with a phenomenological approach which encourages testing initial intuitions by subjecting them to critical evaluation, this section incorporates a peer-reviewed paper written by the researcher. Findings showed that academics experienced concerns and constraints relating to their sense of self, the intercultural other (the students) and the temporal and education environment in which they are situated. Stage Three also addresses the second research question, &#8216;What influences the positive experiences of academics teaching in transnational and multicultural contexts?&#8217; Findings showed that travel and journeying (both physical and metaphorical) were highly significant, beneficial, and contributed greatly to emotional well-being as they allowed the academics to experience joy in transcultural teaching. Stage Four addresses the second research objective and incorporates two research questions. The question &#8216;How are academics&#8217; intercultural competences in multicultural education formed?&#8217; involved the theoretical delineation of the specific research area through an in-depth systematic literature review in order to develop a holistic explanatory model. The model considers epistemology and ontology of teaching practice, and contains four quadrants: self-knowledge, values, knowledge and skills. The final research question, &#8216;How do successful international tourism and hospitality educators embody and integrate competence in their teaching within multicultural and transnational classrooms?&#8217; entailed close phenomenological analysis of the narrated experiences of four academics who had not only derived much enjoyment from their transcultural teaching, but had been publicly recognised by peers and by their universities as being successful teachers. The narrated experiences, approaches and opinions of these academics are analysed and organised according to the model and are explored under the headings Epistemology &#8211; which includes &#8216;cultural knowledge&#8217; and &#8216;skills&#8217;; and Ontology, which covers &#8216;values&#8217; and &#8216;self&#8217;.  Stage Five considers the implications and significance of this research for higher education. The thesis contributes not only to research into teaching and internationalisation of education, but also makes original contributions to qualitative research methodology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">internationalisation</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">intercultural communication</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">competence</field><field name="subject">tourism education</field><field name="subject">hospitality education</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Hospitality Administration and Management</field><field name="subject">International and Intercultural Communication</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/80</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards improvement in aviation safety in Thai Airways International Public Company Limited: a model</field><field name="creator">Suthichoti, Supachoke</field><field name="description">Thai Airways International Public Company Limited (THAI) is a very large organization compared to Thai standards. It generates huge incomes to a number of families, directly and indirectly. Like many airlines, the main concern with THAI and the regulatory authorities is safety because THAI is in a mass transportation business. THAI have had two accidents within a span of some six years, killing a total of 214 people. The accidents affected THAI in four key areas, namely political, economical, social and technological. This phenomenon prompted the study of aviation safety in THAI. The question that requires an answer is: &#8220;How should THAI build its protocols to enhance aviation safety?&#8221; This then became the research question. The objective of the study is to build a model suitable for THAI to enhance aviation safety, thus answering the question. Through a review of the literature within the parent disciplines, the product, process, and customers of flying activities were identified. The four processes, the MP, the HRD, the PM and the RS are recognized through rigorous search of the literature. The developments of the required seven elements of skills needed for pilot performance measurement were made.A review of study within the immediate discipline concerning Aviation Safety in THAI was carried out and the current status in THAI was defined. All of these led to the identification of research question, research objective, and research propositions. The research propositions were:&#8226; Research Proposition 1: that the management practice (MP) process receives inputs from the reporting system (RS) process. Outputs from the management practice (MP) process form inputs for the human resource development (HRD) process.&#8226; Research Proposition 2: that the human resource development (HRD) process receives inputs from the management practice (MP) process. Outputs from the human resource development (HRD) process form inputs for the performance measurement (PM) process.&#8226; Research Proposition 3: that the performance measurement (PM) process receives inputs from the human resource development (HRD) process. Outputs from the human resource development (HRD) process form inputs for the reporting system (RS) process.&#8226; Research Proposition 4: that the reporting system (RS) process receives inputs from the performance measurement (PM) process. Outputs from the reporting system (RS) process form inputs for the management practice (MP) process. &#8226; Research Proposition 5: that the individual process components identified in Research Propositions 1, 2, 3 and 4, can be consolidated into an overall, comprehensive Continual Improvement (CI) loop.Once the research propositions were established, the research design was conceived. Due to the fact that THAI is a unique airline influenced by its history of inception and by particular sets of cultures, an embedded, single case-study research method was used. Many techniques within the case-study method were employed starting from a secondary data search, direct observations, focus group interviews, elite interviews, pilot study, participant observations and in-depth interviews. Issues such as validity, reliability, sensitivity, generalizability and ethics were referred to. Issues on data processing, coding, editing, and interpreting were made and discussed.As a result of the various methods of study and the fieldwork previously mentioned, findings were derived. These were then edited, categorized, coded, tabulated and interpreted into meaningful information. Findings from the study and fieldwork supported all the propositions derived from secondary data search and literature review. Consequently the gap identified in the literature was now filled and the principal model was drawn. A slight modification was introduced in keeping with the interpretation of the findings. A recommendation was made that THAI implement policy measures and professional practices derived from the implication of the study to minimize risks in flight operations system and thus maximize safety.Based on the findings of this research, it is recommended that future studies be conducted employing a deductive, quantitative, statistical method to evaluate the model and test its theoretical implications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thai Airways</field><field name="subject">aviation safety</field><field name="subject">pilot performance management</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/41</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leading innovation and entrepreneurship: an action research study in the Australian red meat industry</field><field name="creator">Pitt, Christine Anne</field><field name="description">The dynamic and often hostile competitive landscape of the twenty-first century has created significant threats to existing patterns of successful competition. A review of the extant literature and research about innovation and entrepreneurship identifies their importance to ensuring corporate vitality and wealth generation in today&#8217;s global economy. For over one hundred andfifty years the foundation of Australia&#8217;s prosperity has been from resource based industries such as agriculture and mining. Changes in the world economy clearly require a much broader range of globally competitive industries to sustain Australia&#8217;s strong economic position. It is proposed that the older more traditional industries must also undergo rapid transformation if they are to maintain their competitive advantage. This thesis describes an action research study conducted over four years (2002-2006) in the Australian red meat industry. The study aimed to extend the body of knowledge on innovation and entrepreneurship in the industry. It also sought to explore options for improving practice through interventions which would accelerate the development of firm innovation capabilities and a culture of innovation more broadly across the industry.The thesis articulates a comprehensive contextual framework of the sector&#8217;s innovation and entrepreneurship system and an associated model of firm innovation and entrepreneurial capability. In addition, a new methodology for mapping the effectiveness of an innovation system is developed based on the emerging concept of system failures. By applying this methodology, a new SI-Intervention Framework is developed and a suite of intervention projects is tested for acceptance and potential impact with industry participants.It is proposed that the thesis offers a contribution to knowledge through convergence of the related fields of innovation and entrepreneurship into a single conceptual framework. In addition, the development of new theoretical and analytical models and methodologies build on and extend the work of previous researchers. Evidence of improved practice is demonstrated in relation to incorporation of the new framework and methodologies into the industry&#8217;s future innovation strategy, building internal capability in the innovation intervention agency, and acceptance by industry participants of the new approach.It is acknowledged that the models and concepts articulated in this thesis are at an early stage of development and that there is a significant amount of further research required. Similarly, as the study is focused on a single case, no attempt is made to offer broad generalisations. The value of the study will ultimately be determined by the specifics of future research contexts and can only be evaluated to the extent that it seems accurate, appropriate and authentic from the reader&#8217;s own perspective.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">innovation</field><field name="subject">entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">innovations systems</field><field name="subject">innovation system failures</field><field name="subject">firm innovation</field><field name="subject">capability</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">food industry</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/36</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Boys' self-esteem: the effect of co-educational schooling</field><field name="creator">Bell, Kevin Phillip</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the changes in self-esteem of adolescent boys going through the school transition from a single-sex to a co-educational environment. The study combined an initial quantitative study followed by an in-depth qualitative study. The quantitative study used the Coopersmith self esteem instrument to measure the self-esteem of boys in Years 7 and 8 in the last year of the all boys' school. The same instrument was used twelve months later on the same students in Years 8 and 9 after the school had undergone the transition to co-education. Analysis of the data indicated that the boys' overall self-esteem had dropped significantly. The second part of the study was a qualitative study to investigate more fully the effect of the transition on the boys at the school. This part of the study was based on data collected from interviews with twenty seven boys and nine staff, as well as various informal interviews and observations made by the author over the period 1998 to 2004. The qualitative study used the principles of grounded theory (Glasser &amp; Strauss, 1967) to draw out the factors and related phenomena to crystallize why the boys' self-esteem may have been adversely affected. Through this process, three key factors emerged; Everybody's Looking at Me (reflecting social self-esteem), Girls Hold You Back a Step and Academic Stuff (both reflecting academic self-esteem). The qualitative study pointed to why the boys may have felt less favourably about themselves in the co-educational environment. These findings are discussed in detail in relation to the extant literature.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">self esteem</field><field name="subject">adolescent boys</field><field name="subject">co-education</field><field name="subject">single sex school</field><field name="subject">boy's education</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/55</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Midwife to Gaia, birthing global consciousness: a reflective topical autobiography</field><field name="creator">Myers, Estelle</field><field name="description">This Reflective Topical Autobiography (RTA) aimed to reflect on and recount my own actual life stories and the life lessons learned, in order to identify patterns, trends and insights from my life and to offer these insights to others. My objectives were to promote personal empowerment as a tool for fulfilling individual potential, and to heal and be healed, by taking personal responsibility and making choices that enhance the individual and thus the collective consciousness.The research questions I posed to myself to assist in reflecting on and recounting my life stories were: What are the key stories of my life? What life lessons have I learned from my experiences? What are the patterns, trends and insights from my life? How can I offer these insights to other people? The RTA activities included writing personal stories, reflecting on my life patterns, trends and insights, and using photographs and a DVD production, to illustrate the main ideas and events.The research process allowed me to move from being reactive to reflective and to answer the research questions. Some of my life lessons learned from my experiences are that: one person can make a difference; lack of money is not lack of personal power; and nothing is impossible. My life patterns and trends include having a high-energy lifestyle, living without fear, learning to deal with disappointments, keeping life records, taking responsibility for action, and creating a morphic field. This RTA also offers insights to other people, with whom they resonate.It became apparent to me, in the process of documenting my personal journey in this RTA, that by suspending judgement and keeping an open mind and open heart, I am able to attune to what I call &#8216;Divine Intelligence&#8217;. It is a deep cellular knowing, that we are all connected. In 32 years of my own development, I have witnessed quantum leaps in the disciplines of science, spirit, ancient wisdom and health, which are acknowledged in the academies of the world. There is a new way of seeing and thinking, which is about a future based on these holistic principles of interconnectedness. It is the contention of this RTA that thoughts and intentions are the tools for personal and global change.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="subject">Medicine and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/78</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complex adaptive systems and organisational understanding in the Royal Australian Air Force</field><field name="creator">Brown, Callum Soutar</field><field name="description">The dissertation contends that an instrument developed through using a model of complex adaptive systems as a generative metaphor will assist members of an organisation to better understand their organisation.  Using an action research methodology, six Air Force Management Services Teams were exposed to six overlapping attributes of complex adaptive systems through focus group workshops with an aim to determine whether they, as experienced management consulting practitioners, saw value to themselves and their Air Force clients of using aspects of complex adaptive systems for organisational understanding.  The overlapping attributes of complex adaptive systems were distilled from the literature reviewed.  Whereas the focus group workshop participants found the attributes valuable in understanding the dynamics of organisational behaviour, they found the new way of thinking challenging on a number of different perspectives.  Some aspects of the Air Force organisation, like its high levels of organisational experience, will make the introduction to and use of complex adaptive systems thinking simpler, while other aspects of the Air Force organisation, like its sensitivity to complex adaptive systems terminology, will make the introduction and use of complex adaptive systems more challenging.  Notwithstanding the challenges, both the complex adaptive systems model, and the use of action research were found to be useful ways of introducing organisations to complex adaptive systems thinking.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CAS</field><field name="subject">complexity</field><field name="subject">metaphor</field><field name="subject">organisation</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Organizational Behavior and Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/16</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reproduction and recruitment of scleractinian corals on equatorial reefs in Mombasa, Kenya</field><field name="creator">Mangubhai, Sangeeta</field><field name="description">This study examined patterns of coral reproduction and recruitment on lagoonal reefs adjacent to Mombasa in Kenya, at latitude 4&#186;S. Very little detailed research has been done on the reproductive patterns of scleractinian corals on equatorial reefs, where it has been suggested that seasonality and spawning synchrony may break down due to the weak environmental cues that are thought to govern the onset and timing of reproduction. Gametogenic data were collected for three faviid (Echinopora gemmacea, Platygyra daedalea and Leptoria phrygia) and three Acropora species (A. tenuis, A. valida and Acropora sp.1) in the Mombasa Marine National Park and Reserve between April 2003 &#8211; May 2005. A further 20 species of Acropora were identified (9 species represented range extensions) and marked to examine intra- and inter-specific spawning synchrony within this genus. In comparison to other regions, the overall pattern of coral reproduction in Kenya was found to be asynchronous, with spawning occurring over 9 months of the year from August &#8211; April, with some level of &#8216;temporal reproductive isolation&#8217; occurring between species in relation to the main lunar month and lunar quarter when spawning occurred. Proximate cues governing the timing of reproduction could not be clearly discerned in Kenya with spawning occurring during both rising and maximum temperatures, during both neap and spring tides and across all lunar phases. Acropora species spawned over a 7-month period between October &#8211; April and faviid species over a 5-month period from December - April. The timing of reproduction in Acropora varied both within and among species, with the main release of gametes occurring from January &#8211; March when sea surface temperatures were at their summer maximum. Individual species released gametes over 2-5 months. The greatest overlap in spawning Acropora species occurred in February, which coincided with the spawning months of P. daedalea and E. gemmacea and suggests that some degree of multispecific spawning is a characteristic of Kenyan reefs. Within the main spawning period individual Acropora species had their main spawning in different lunar months. Acropora species released gametes in all lunar quarters, with the highest number of colonies and species spawning in the 3rd lunar quarter (i.e. in the 7 nights after full moon). Spawning in the faviids was more synchronised than Acropora species with the majority of faviid corals spawning in the 3rd lunar quarter. Single annual cycles of gametogenesis were recorded in E. gemmacea, A. tenuis, L.phrygia, most colonies of A. valida and Acropora sp.1, and in 84% of P. daedalea colonies. Biannual cycles of gametogenesis were recorded in 16% of P.daedalea colonies, which included two morphotypes identified in the Mombasa lagoon through morphometric and genetic studies. The presence of different oocyte sizes in L.phrygia during gametogenesis suggested that in some colonies there were two slightly overlapping oogenic cycles, which terminated in spawning within 1-2 months of each other. Overlapping oogenic cycles have not previously been recorded in hermaphroditic broadcast spawning corals in the tropics. The findings from Kenya support the hypothesis of protracted breeding seasons and a breakdown of spawning synchrony nearer the equator. It is hypothesised that the high fecundities recorded in faviid and Acropora species in Kenya compared to other regions, may allow reef corals to stagger their reproduction over 2-5 months, without incurring a significant reduction in fertilisation rates. Spat from the Family Pocilloporidae dominated settlement tiles in the Marine National Park and Reserve comprising 93.7% of spat, which contrasts with other tropical reefs where Acroporidae spat dominate. Patterns of settlement of Acroporidae spat generally coincided with the timing and extended spawning season in Acropora species in Kenya. The density and relative composition of coral recruits and juvenile corals on natural substrata recorded during this study were similar to those recorded before the 1997-98 bleaching event. There is no evidence to suggest that Kenya&#8217;s reefs have undergone a phase-shift in community structure, and reef recovery is occurring post-bleaching with mean percent hard coral cover currently at 25%. The slow rate of recovery of Kenya&#8217;s reefs is likely to reflect the scale of the mortality, source and availability of coral larvae as well as post-settlement processes operating at individual sites. In the medium-term, the recovery of Kenya&#8217;s reefs appears to be more strongly dependent on larvae from local reefs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coral</field><field name="subject">coral reproduction</field><field name="subject">coral spawning</field><field name="subject">equatorial reefs</field><field name="subject">Western Indian Ocean</field><field name="subject">gametogenesis</field><field name="subject">Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/1</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial management and profitability of small and medium enterprises</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Kieu Minh</field><field name="description">After a decade of reforming policy, building and developing the multi-sector market economy, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam have developed strongly and contributed to creating employment, increasing GDP, and raising the nation&#8217;s volume of exports. However, SMEs have found difficulties on the way to development due to lack of management experience and financial resources, and due to uncertainty within the business environment. As a result, SMEs often faced obstacles during their operations. This thesis examines the relationship between financial management and profitability of SMEs to determine whether financial management practices and financial characteristics impact on SME profitability. Objectives of the thesis are (1) to investigate and describe features of financial management practices and financial characteristics of SMEs in Vietnam, (2) to develop and test a model of SME profitability, and (3) to contribute knowledge of the relationships between financial management and characteristics to improve SME profitability by using tools of efficient financial management. In terms of structure, the thesis has six chapters. The thesis begins by defining the research problem and questions, and providing a justification for the research study. Chapter one also reviews the research background, and presents definitions of terms, significance and scope of the study. Chapter two examines the economic background, business structure and the development of SMEs in Vietnam. This chapter also reviews previous research related to financial management for SMEs in Vietnam to identify gaps between financial management for SMEs in Vietnam and financial management for SMEs worldwide. Chapter three reviews financial management including financial management practices, financial characteristics and profitability of SMEs around the world, especially in the developed economies such as the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and Canada. This review emphasizes profitability and the impact of financial management practices and financial characteristics on SME profitability. Objectives of this chapter are to review previous research related to the areas of financial management practices, financial characteristics, and profitability of SMEs and to build a model of the impact of financial management practices and financial characteristics on SME profitability. Chapter four discusses aspects of the research methodology including research design, data collection and data analysis methods, and hypothesis testing to support the model. Objectives of this chapter are: (1) to justify the research methodology of this study, (2) to explain research methodology used in the study, and (3) to demonstrate how research design, and data collection and analysis can be utilized in this study to answer the research questions outlined in the chapter 1. Data analysis and findings are presented in chapter five. This chapter presents descriptive findings of financial management practices, financial characteristics and SME profitability and findings of the research study related to testing the model of SME profitability. Objectives of this chapter are (1) to systematically present the descriptive findings of the research study, (2) to interpret significance of these findings based on data analysis, (3) to present the results of testing the model of SME profitability, and (4) to explain how the model, developed from a literature review, was supported by data analysis. Finally, the thesis ends with chapter six where conclusions are summarized and applications of the research findings are indicated for the financial management practitioners. The thesis provides descriptive findings of financial management practices and financial characteristics and demonstrates the simultaneous impact of financial management practices and financial characteristics on SME profitability. In addition, the research study provides a model of SME profitability, in which profitability was found to be related to financial management practices and financial characteristics. With the exception of debt ratios, all other variables including current ratio, total asset turnover, working capital management and short-term planning practices, fixed asset management and long-term planning practices, and financial and accounting information systems were found to be significantly related to SME profitability. With the findings as presented above, this research study provides many implications for financial management practices and contributes to knowledge of financial management of SMEs. The model of SME profitability can be used as guidance for actions to improve the profitability of SMEs in Vietnam.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SMEs</field><field name="subject">financial characteristics</field><field name="subject">financial management practices</field><field name="subject">profitability</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurial and Small Business Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/32</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The professionalisation of aromatherapy: a case study of the professionalisation of complementary and alternative medicine in the Australian health care system</field><field name="creator">Sheen, Janelle Gwen</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to examine aromatherapy practice in relation to its claim of being or becoming a profession. This process of professionalisation is explored within the current context where the status of complementary and alternative medicines within the Australian health care system, like aromatherapy practice, is currently influenced by medical dominance and broader social and political scrutiny. This investigation of aromatherapy practice may provide a model for the general professionalisation, or development, of complementary and alternative medicine in Australian health care today. Critical theory was employed as the primary methodology of this study. As critical theory has no defined method for data collection, grounded theory data collection and analysis methods were used to obtain current and relevant data from two of the most prominent users of aromatherapy practice in health care, aromatherapists and nurses.The study found that while aromatherapy is often referred to as a profession, it fails to meet the criteria for being considered a profession in the &#8216;true&#8217; sense. The data also revealed felt dissatisfactions experienced by aromatherapists&#8217; to be due to the lack of recognition of the practice and a perceived double bind regarding the need to establish an appropriate knowledge base via scientific research and maintaining the &#8216;essence&#8217; of aromatherapy practice. Considering the professionalisation process and the requirements of the system (health care and Government) a number of potential pathways for the development of aromatherapy practice were explored. The findings and discussion have relevance to other complementary and alternative modalities endeavouring to professionalise and or increase their status within the Australian health care system. In addition the study considers the related public felt dissatisfaction and revealed false consciousness relating to a broader social change and the integration of holistic and biomedical practices in health care.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/3</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing an integrated e-learning culture: a model grounded in the Australian Army experience</field><field name="creator">Newton, Diane</field><field name="description">Understanding the influences on e-learning effectiveness in workplaces is a necessary, but contentious task. The transfer of knowledge about e-learning from higher education to workplace situations has resulted in discursive tensions between expectations and practice. Measurement of the aspects of e-learning effectiveness is often discussed in the literature in terms of discrete economic, pedagogical and technological criteria. Few studies have investigated e-learning use in terms of the complexity of factors in a workplace environment and there is a scarcity of relevant substantive models of e-learning effectiveness factors in workplace contexts. This study aimed to improve understanding of the factors influencing e-learning effectiveness, particularly in large, dispersed workplaces and to develop a model based on the understanding of these factors. This study represents the first external research into the Australian Army&#8217;s e-learning projects. The Army was selected as a large, dispersed workplace organisation with ten years experience in designing and using multimedia rich CD-ROM learning materials. The Army had undertaken trialing and evaluation of its e-learning courses prior to providing substantial infrastructure for implementation in training centres. These evaluations indicated e-learning effectiveness in terms of training efficiencies and learning outcomes that at least matched traditional face-to-face classroom instruction. That is, that e-learning fitted with the training requirements. The study was aimed at the understanding of how the Army&#8217;s workplace environment was influencing the effectiveness of e-learning courses from multiple perspectives.Using an inductive Grounded Theory approach provided an established analytical method for developing a substantive model. While the field-based research was limited to a single organisation, it included multiple sites across Australia and a cross-section of e-learning activities and respondents throughout the organisational hierarchy. The main data source was 101 open-ended interviews conducted with respondents at Army bases or by phone. Where interviewing was not possible due to Army operational concerns, questionnaires were used (129 responses). Other data sources included Army documents and the researcher&#8217;s observations and participation in e-learning classes.While the Army&#8217;s internal evaluation processes had justified the adoption of e-learning courses, it was evident in the study that the interaction of factors within the Army&#8217;s culture was influencing perceptions and experiences of e-learning effectiveness. An Integrated E-learning Culture Model (IECM) based on the analysis of stakeholder perspectives in the Army is presented. The IECM is based on the four factors that emerged as influencing e-learning effectiveness, which were organisational priorities, the learning environment, the instructor&#8217;s role and learners&#8217; needs. The main concern for respondents was to manage tensions associated with these four factors by integrating e-learning into the organisational culture. That is, e-learning effectiveness was discussed in terms of a process of alignment of the e-learning culture with the organisational culture.Comparison of the IECM with some empirical studies of e-learning use in other large, dispersed workplaces indicates its relevance outside the Army context. An E-learning Comparative Alignment Framework (ECAF) for using the IECM in other research was developed in this study. Further comparison of the ECAF with alignment theories from related research disciplines suggests areas for further theoretical research. This thesis proposes that by adopting the perspective that e-learning environments are not value-free, it is possible to identify and align the competing priorities and discourses that influence how e-learning effectiveness is constructed and experienced in an organisation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research</field><field name="subject">Instructional Media Design</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/62</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Snakes in the grass: visual research into myth themes as a means of understanding and interpreting current environmental issues, and as a vehicle for generating art works in response to those issues : an exegesis of the serpent archetype in Mesopotamian/biblical and aboriginal Australian belief systems</field><field name="creator">Rhys, Gillian Lenin</field><field name="description">Snakes in the grass is a visual research endeavour that utilises an arts and science disciplinary interface, to develop a method for generating a series of contemporary allegorical artworks that engage a study of Serpent symbolism and mythology. On the side of Trinity Catholic College beside St. Carthage&#8217;s Cathedral in Lismore stands a life-sized sculpture of the Virgin Mary standing on a Serpent. Inside the school can be found a smaller version of the same sculpture, where priests and students light candles and incense, and place them around the statue. This thesis researches and questions the iconography of the &#8216;cursed Serpent&#8217; as a primary signifier in the European Biblical tradition in Australia, as it stands alongside the iconography of the existing Indigenous cultures of this land, cultures that have a tradition of Serpent veneration. The intention is to identify correlations between differing cultural and social attitudes that are embedded in religious traditions, and different attitudes to the use of natural resources. Material collected through studying the history of Biblical traditions is superimposed, in a form of cultural montage, on to images of technical procedures of research undertaken by scientists researching an innovative water remediation process on Mt Carrington in northern NSW. The scientific research was focused at a disabled gold mine, where acid mine drainage contamination was severe, and represents a small yet significant example of environmental issues being faced all over the world. This research used salt water neutralised bauxite, or red mud, a waste product from aluminium mining to remediate water and soil affected by gold and silver mining. The creative process developed into a contemporary allegorical narrative that operates as a personification and an enactment of a subjective re-reading of issues surrounding Serpent symbolism and the environment. The resulting artworks include paintings, photographs and an earthwork sculpture on the mine site at Mt Carrington. These works are generated to research, focus attention on, and stimulate discussion about cultural and environmental changes and challenges in Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arts and Humanities</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/63</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New information and communication technologies and community radio stations</field><field name="creator">Coates, Wendy Lee</field><field name="description">This is an investigation of the diffusion of new information and communication technologies (ICTs), particularly the Internet, by community broadcasting organisations. In order to understand ICT diffusion processes in community radio stations, this study focuses on a particular project which saw a large scale diffusion of Internet technologies across Australian community radio stations at the beginning of 1998. The Community Access Network (CAN) project was an initiative of the Australian government, and saw funding for the provision of an Internet ready computer to every licensed community radio station in Australia. In approaching this subject, this research employed social constructivist assumptions, expecting that ICT use, and in particular the CAN workstations, would vary from station to station, reflecting the cultural and organisational conditions in each environment. As such the study aimed to understand the ways in which ICT technologies have been used and understood by community ralo station management and their participants. Since community radio stations are organisations, this study employed Everett Rogers' framework for understanding diffusion of innovation processes within organisations, acknowledging that organisational variables act on innovation behaviour in a manner over and above that of the aggregate of individual members of the organisation. This approach provided scope for the investigation and comparison of organisational factors, as well as meaning making on the part of individual participants. The research was based on data collected from two case studies, chosen on the basis of their divergent social, cultural and organisational environments; 4EB in Brisbane, a metropolitan, ethnic community radio station; and 2NCR-FM in Lismore, a regional, generalist community radio station. Ethnographic methods of observation and interviews were employed to collect qualitative data, providing insider accounts of community broadcaster's use, experience, and understanding of the new technologies in their day-to-day broadcast practices. By looking at two different community radio stations, this research acknowledges points of similarity and difference across these organisational situations, identifying factors that contribute to variation in technology take-up in particular station programming emphasis, perception of need, organisational resources, role of innovation champions, training, ICT policy and broadcaster variables. Evidence drawn from these case studies, and the specific ICT investigated, contributes to a general understanding of factors in the diffusion of ICT technologies across the community broadcast sector, providing a frame of reference for anticipating subsequent innovation diffusion. In particular, there are implications for future diffusion projects which plan to deploy new technologies across the community radio sector. It also contextualises community broadcasting and ICT use within the field of new technology uptake by broadcast sectors in general.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community radio</field><field name="subject">community broadcasting</field><field name="subject">community media</field><field name="subject">information and communication technologies</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">diffusion of innovations</field><field name="subject">Communication Technology and New Media</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/57</field></doc><doc><field name="title">De-gendering the electronic soundscape: women, power and technology in contemporary music</field><field name="creator">Brown, Jennifer M</field><field name="description">In this project, I focus on women's relationships with technology in the context of contemporary music culture. In choosing this focus, I intend to elucidate the interplay between social constructs of gender, power and technology as they enacted in a particular arena of artistic and economic activity. The nature of this interplay is informed by prevailing regimes of truth which have emerged through historical processes and which surface in diverse social contexts, of which this is but one. My intention here is to identify such regimes and to situate women's discourses within them. In this undertaking, I draw on a body of theory which lies at the conjunction of contemporary feminist critique and the later work of Michel Foucault on power and the 'technologies of the self' to explore a model of power which promises cogent strategies in the feminist project of reworking notions of gender and social agency.  The inquiry enlists the perspectives of women students in a university school of contemporary music through a guided interview process. The technologies referred to include musical instruments both of traditional and twentieth century design, as well as a range of sophisticated systems of equipment used for recording and amplifying, for composing and arranging music.  Through analysis of the interview data and through readings from social science and musicology, I identify a dominant discourse, or regime of truth, which privileges men and marginalizes women in the realm of techno-musical activity. Alongside this prevailing regime are women's discourses which both comply with and dissent from its assumptions. In examining these discourses, I seek insights into the processes by which women collude in their own exclusion from a male-colonized terrain, but also exercise power to insist on entry. The alignment of technology and masculinity in contemporary music creates serious training and employment disadvantages for women in many facets of the industry. I contend that this anomaly demands attention in the interests of socio-economic justice, in the interests of the industry itself through full utilization of human resources and market potential, and in the interests of women's desires to expand their creative options and employment opportunities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">popular music</field><field name="subject">voice</field><field name="subject">feminist research</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">audio engineering</field><field name="subject">Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies</field><field name="subject">Music</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/74</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing and testing a model of cooperative interorganisational relationships (IORs) in product innovation in an Australian manufacturing context: a multi-stakeholder perspective</field><field name="creator">von der Heidt, Tania</field><field name="description">As fast-growth economies, such as China and India are dominating export markets, innovation in the manufacturing industries of slower, developed  economies, such as Australia is a survival issue. Particularly small- and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SMMEs) with limited internal innovation resources and capabilities are suffering. Corresponding with this development, academic interest in analysing the relationship between innovative performance of small firms and their recourse to external resources, especially through interorganisational relationships (IORs) has been growing over the last ten to fifteen years. To date the emerging literature has given limited attention to the systematic empirical assessment of the relationship and innovation inputs and outputs of cooperative product innovation. Furthermore, most of the literature focuses on cooperative innovation IORs with customer stakeholders, ignoring the potential role played by other external stakeholder groups, such as suppliers, industry partners and research/advisory organisations. To this end, this thesis investigated the following research question: What are the relationships between IOR- and innovation-oriented antecedents and consequences of cooperative product innovation and how effective for overall firm performance is product innovation cooperation with multiple stakeholders? A six-factor multi-stakeholder model of cooperative IORs in product innovation for Australian manufacturers was developed from a strategy-structure-performance-based model of marketing channel relationship structure. It synthesised and built upon prior models of cooperative product innovation and incorporated concepts and measures drawn from the IOR and product innovation literatures. The central, structure-based construct (measurement model) developed was stakeholder involvement in product innovation (SIPI). Two factors were used to predict SIPI: Stakeholder orientation (SO) and Product innovation orientation (PIO). A further two factors represented outcomes of SIPI: Relationship quality (RQ) and Product innovation performance (PIP). A sixth factor - Overall firm performance (OFP) - was also measured to assess the broader implications of the model. Two objective, single-item variables were also included in the model &#8211; relative Product innovation spending (associated with PIO) and Sales growth (associated with OFP).To address the multi-stakeholder perspective, four external stakeholder groups most likely to be involved in a manufacturer&#8217;s product innovation (customers, suppliers, industry partners (competitors) and research/advisory organisations) were assessed. Eight hypotheses positing associations between the six constructs were developed. As strategic data was required, the research method for primary data collection was a survey of CEOs/General Managers of Australian machinery and equipment manufacturers, predominately SMMEs. A questionnaire was designed to measure their opinions about the firm&#8217;s relationships with each of the four stakeholder groups in product innovation as well as their views on the firm&#8217;s product innovation orientation and performance. Following extensive pre-testing of the questionnaire, it was distributed by mail and online to the senior managers. Data obtained from 120 respondents was used in the research.Using a two-step structural equation modelling (SEM): confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach, examinations of parameter estimates, fit and residuals were used to test the individual constructs for validity. Composite reliability and average variance extracted were used to test for construct reliability. An overall (multi-stakeholder) structural model, as well as four single-stakeholder models, of key relationship- and innovation-oriented antecedents and consequences of cooperative product innovation were then tested using SEM AMOS software. Meaningful modifications of the hypothesised model were undertaken to improve model fit. The four modified single-stakeholder models and the overall (multistakeholder) model were found to provide a satisfactory fit. Statistically significant standard coefficients for each of the latent constructs provided evidence of the importance of each element as an input or outcome of cooperative innovation. The results indicated that, as posited, a firm&#8217;s Product innovation orientation (PIO) was positively associated with its Stakeholder orientation (SO). SO, in turn, was a valid antecedent of cooperative product innovation (SIPI). The hypothesised direct path from SIPI to RQ was, however, not supported. Instead, SIPI was found to partially mediate the SO-RQ association, further strengthening that positive link. Surprisingly, PIO did not appear to significantly influence cooperative innovation SIPI. Instead, PIO was found to be a strong and direct antecedent of market- and technical-oriented PIP, whereby the cooperative innovation construct SIPI did not materially impact Product innovation performance PIP. Product innovation spending directly influenced technical-oriented PIP only. RQ was a valid predictor of Sales growth, but not of Overall firm performance OFP. While market-oriented PIP was found to lead to stronger assessments of OFP, increased technical-oriented PIP negatively impacted on OFP. Consequently, seven of the eight hypotheses relating to the research model were accepted in part or full, and one hypothesis was rejected.Overall, qualified support was found for the central proposition: Higher (sales) growth manufacturers tend to pay more attention to their relationships with the top firms in each of four stakeholders groups (customers, suppliers, industry partners and advisory/research firms), involve these firms more in product innovation activities and perceive their relationships to be of higher &#8216;quality&#8217;. Firms with sound overall firm performance (return on investment, net profit, market share and overall business performance) tend to be more product innovation focused (in terms of strategy and spending) and achieve product innovations, which are successful both technologically and market-wise. However, stakeholder involvement in product innovation is not as good a predictor of product innovation outcomes as is the firm&#8217;s product innovation orientation (strategy).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/70</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metallisation and interconnection of polycrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells on glass superstrates</field><field name="creator">Walsh, Timothy M, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Thin-film photovoltaics seem set to become a large part of future photovoltaic production worldwide, due to the fact that thin-film photovoltaic modules have the potential to be manufactured for a significantly lower cost per peak Watt of photovoltaic electricity produced than traditional wafer-based photovoltaic modules. Of particular interest are polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-film photovoltaic devices on foreign supporting superstrates such as glass, because they combine the best features of wafer-based modules (long-term stability, vast manufacturing experience) with the best features of thin-film modules (lower materials cost, and monolithic construction techniques). Since polycrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells on glass superstrates are a relatively recent development in photovoltaics, there remains much scope for the investigation and implementation of novel metallisation and interconnection schemes. This thesis is concerned with the invention and development of metallisation and interconnection schemes for this new photovoltaic material, poly-Si on glass. In this thesis, several new metallisation and interconnection schemes for poly-Si solar cells on glass superstrates were invented and investigated: - The sequential metallisation and interconnection scheme, which is based on cells with interdigitated n-type and p-type contacts, and subsequent inter-connection of individual cells. - The metal-free interconnection scheme, which relies on laser-doping of regions of the silicon film to interconnect adjacent cells, and does not require metal contacts. - The spanning-gap interconnection scheme, which involves laser-scribing of the silicon film, and overdoping one sidewall of each laser scribe, then connecting adjacent cells by filling the laser scribe with metal. - The wrap-over interconnection scheme, which employs laser scribing and insulating and conductive laser-scribe sidewalls, and a metal layer which interconnects adjacent cells. Also investigated was the specific contact resistance of each type of metal-semiconductor contact used in the various interconnection schemes. The various interconnection schemes were developed to different levels of completion. The sequential metallisation and interconnection scheme yielded fully functioning mini-modules with good efficiencies. The wrap-over interconnection scheme made it to the proof of concept stage, while the other two schemes did not reach completion due to various technical difficulties and time constraints.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Active equity fund management: Benchmarking and trading behaviour</field><field name="creator">Lee, Adrian David, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates key issues concerning how active equity fund managers add value: measuring alpha (Chapter 3), generating alpha (Chapters 4, 5 and 6) and transaction cost minimisation (Chapter 7). Chapter 3 proposes important methodological adjustments to the widely adopted benchmarking methodology of Daniel, Grinblatt, Titman and Wermers (1997). Applying this modified benchmark to a sample of active funds and simulated passive portfolios that mimic fund manager style characteristics, statistically lower tracking error is documented, compared with using the standard methodology. These findings suggest that improved specifications of characteristic benchmarks represent better methods in accurately quantifying fund manager skill. Chapter 4 examines a portfolio strategy which selects stocks using the undisclosed monthly holdings of Australian active funds. When considering a large range of strategies incorporating portfolio holdings information, the top performing strategies are robust to data-snooping and are economically and statistically significant when incorporating transaction costs. Accounting for look-ahead bias in the formation of a strategy, statistically significant alpha of at least 6.88 percent per year is found when following the best performing strategy holding 20 stocks or more in the previous month. Chapter 5 examines the relation of active equity fund managers location proximity to a stock??s corporate headquarter using portfolio holdings data. Contrary to much international research, this study reveals evidence inconsistent with a location advantage for Melbourne and Sydney-based funds. Chapter 6 examines retail investor trading on the Australian Stock Exchange. The performance of retail investors is highly heterogeneous: discount (non-discount) retail brokerage investors lose -0.59 (-0.05) percent intraday and experience negative (positive) returns over the subsequent year. These findings are inconsistent with retail investors exerting price pressure or providing liquidity to institutions. Chapter 7 examines whether equity fund managers use multiple brokers in a trade package in order to lower their price impact and brokerage costs. Using the daily trades of funds, multiple broker trades are not found to have lower costs compared to a single broker, even when controlling for the informativeness of the trade package and potential endogeneity. These findings suggest that fund managers do not lower their costs when using multiple brokers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Individual Investors</field><field name="subject">Funds management</field><field name="subject">Trading costs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cover me: animal defences, armour and the amulet</field><field name="creator">Shepherd, Kamila, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cover Me: Animal Defences, Armour and the Amulet is a research project undertaken through studio investigations in the field of contemporary jewellery and object design. This interrogation is presented as a body of wearable and non-wearable objects exhibited at Kudos Gallery, Sydney Australia, in May 2009 and contextualised through a written document.  Historically jewellery's functions have been to denote rank, to adorn and to protect the wearer by magical means. The research investigates traditional approaches to magical jewellery- surveying the design of charms, amulets and talismans and the perceived methods of their functioning- and observes their parallels and similarities with defensive structures and behaviours such as the phenomenon of mimicry in the animal kingdom.  The document presents a survey of the work of contemporary jewellery artists whose visual language is informed by natural forms and bears a remarkable numinous presence, employing this analysis to comment on humanity's relationship with and separation from nature. The works in Cover Me are developed from and framed by similar speculations and the findings anchored to the body.  Through primary studio research that involves staged visual investigations of a variety of animal defences a series of drawn and material experiments have been undertaken. The findings generated in the studio have utilised the amplification and exaggeration of recurring elements. The repetitive attributes are employed to harness our instinctive reactions to animal defences and serve as the foundation for the design of a widely accessible visual vocabulary of protection. The resultant summary is articulated in metal and fibre and manifest in the series of jewellery objects.  In offering itself up as an example of work where protective language symbolism can be understood as such by people from a variety of cultural and religious backgrounds and as an alternative for traditional protective symbols. Cover Me attempts to mitigate the damage inflicted upon the magical jewel's perceived metaphysical protection by misappropriation where traditional amuletic devices and protective religious symbols (the Christian cross/ crucifix being a key example) are misappropriated in commercial fashion jewellery.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43667</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Terror Australis: being a fictionalised extract from the journal of Matthew Flinders, concerning a series of conversations regarding masculine identity as located in contemporary Australia</field><field name="creator">Sheppard-Simms, Shannon Field, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Abstract not included.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of surface hot shortness in low carbon steel</field><field name="creator">O'Neill, Daniel Scott, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A series of model steels containing copper levels up to 0.48wt%, nickel up to 0.22wt% and silicon levels of 0.52wt% were oxidised in air at 1050 and 1150??C, and in a CO2-N2 mixture at 1250??C for times of up to 3 hours. The scaling kinetics were measured and the behaviour of copper-rich phase formation at the scale/metal interface was investigated. When oxidised at 1050/1150??C, significant quantities of copper-rich phase were observed for most model steels. The relatively high oxidation rate under these conditions led to the rapid development of a copper-rich layer with little copper diffusing into the metal. However, when oxidised at 1250??C, the copper-rich phase did not form for a significant amount of time; and for some model steels, not at all. This was attributed to the considerably lower oxidation rate and the fact that more copper was found to have diffused into the metal. Alloying additions of nickel and silicon were found to be beneficial in reducing the amount of copper-rich phase measured at the scale/metal interface under the conditions investigated at 1150??C and 1250??C. This occurred because nickel and silicon addition promoted the occlusion of copper-rich phase into the scale.  Copper enrichment during oxidation was modelled using a numerical description of the diffusion processes involved. Predictions of the time for commencement of copper-rich phase formation at 1250??C were in close agreement with observation. Agreement between predicted and observed copper-rich layer thickness was less successful under conditions where occlusion was significant, and the measured thickness varied non-uniformly with time.  The cracking susceptibility of the model steels was examined using a hot compression test. Oxidation was performed in air at 1050, 1150 and 1250??C and most specimens were compressed at 1050??C. The amount of cracking was found to increase with the amount of copper-rich phase precipitated at the scale/metal interface during oxidation. In general, nickel addition reduced the amount of cracking at all temperatures; and under some conditions prevented cracking altogether. Silicon reduced or completely suppressed cracking when the subscale formed was liquid. The beneficial effects of nickel and silicon addition were attributed to their effect of promoting copper occlusion.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">copper embrittlement</field><field name="subject">cracking</field><field name="subject">residual element enrichment</field><field name="subject">oxidation</field><field name="subject">carbon steel fracture</field><field name="subject">copper</field><field name="subject">electric furnaces</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three essays on price formation and liquidity in financial futures markets</field><field name="creator">Cummings, James Richard</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Financial futures</field><field name="subject">Arbitrage</field><field name="subject">Market efficiency</field><field name="subject">Block trades</field><field name="subject">Limit order book</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NEW METHODS FOR MINING  SEQUENTIAL AND TIME SERIES  DATA</field><field name="creator">Al-Naymat, Ghazi</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Data mining</field><field name="subject">Spatial data</field><field name="subject">Spatio-temporal</field><field name="subject">Time series data</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5295</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Body composition analysis in the assessment of cancer cachexia treatment outcomes</field><field name="creator">Aslani, Alireza</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer cachexia</field><field name="subject">Pancreatic cancer</field><field name="subject">Body composition</field><field name="subject">Total Body Protein</field><field name="subject">Total Body Water</field><field name="subject">Total Body Fat</field><field name="subject">Surgery</field><field name="subject">Whipple's Procedure</field><field name="subject">Eicosapentaenoic Acid</field><field name="subject">Fish oil</field><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Innovation and its interaction with market orientation : a study of Australian manufacturing SMEs</field><field name="creator">Low, David R.</field><field name="description">In pursuing sustainable competetive advantage, firms undertake a range of strategic initiatives such as innovation, customer relationship management, entering new markets overseas, and competetive actions within current marketplaces. Studies that examine these initiatives generally investigate the firm's strategy by either: (i) focussing on one strategy only, and examining its impact on firm performance and the role of employees in the implementation of this strategy; or (ii) studying the interaction of two or more strategies. This study explores the interaction between two strategies, innovation and market orientation, and identifies key components of the market orientation construct that interact with the innovation process. This study utilised both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The quantitative data collection used scales which had been previously developed that show high reliability and have gained a level of acceptance in the literature. A survey was sent to companies that matched the target population characteristics. The survey measured five things : (a) the market orientation of the firm, (b) the innovativeness of the firm, (c) the firm performance, (d)aspects of the firm's competetive environment, and (e) changes in the firm's competetive environment. The data analysed was gathered using appropriate statistical techniques.

Only a minority of people diagnosed with AN ever become asymptomatic and more research has been called for to address high drop-out rates and lack of engagement in AN treatment services, in particular psychotherapeutic treatment. Prior studies have generally examined this problem in terms of patient mediated variables, such as attitudes and behaviours, with little focus on contextual factors. Research that has studied therapeutic engagement in the area of AN has yet to examine psychotherapeutic treatments-in-practice. Guided by this gap in the literature this thesis examines ways in which therapists engage with adolescents diagnosed with AN in naturally occurring psychotherapeutic interactions. A secondary and concurrent focus is to look at how the therapists&#146; underlying theoretical models are reflected in in situ practice. The data corpus comprises twenty-four therapy sessions recorded in an eating disorders programme based in a children&#146;s hospital. In contrast to eating disorders treatment statistics reported in the literature, the programme has a low drop-out rate, zero mortality rate and good long-term patient outcomes, making it an especially suitable setting to examine engagement.

Drawing on methods from discursive psychology (DP) and conversation analysis (CA), a number of interactional practices are found which show how the key principles of engagement and neutrality are brought off, or achieved as such in turn-by-turn interaction. Central to the analysis, is the recurrent production of patients&#146; bodily states and conduct as delicate items. As these topics are also the primary focus of the institutional setting, the analysis shows how practices such as perspective display series and dispositional management allow delicately marked institutional tasks to be carried out. The analysis also examines how patients&#146; bodies and conduct are embedded in, and constituted as problematic in the interactions. Regularities, such as agentic repositioning in accounts, demonstrate the co-production of patients as psychologically compliant with treatment while physically non-compliant.  

This thesis contributes to work in applied CA concerning links between theoretical models and interactional practices by demonstrating naturally occurring regularities that describe key guiding principles of the eating disorders programme. It also builds on work in DP concerning examinations of the body and embodiment, by showing how patients&#146; physical bodies are an integrated feature of the interactions. Finally, this thesis has implications for a clinical audience in terms of extending therapists&#146; awareness of how engagement with patients is constituted interactionally, which also contributes to wider AN literature on &#145;resistance&#146; to therapy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anorexia nervosa</field><field name="subject">therapeutic engagement</field><field name="subject">discursive psychology</field><field name="subject">resistance</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090714.94110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A search for shorter, more convergent routes to enantiopure naphthopyrans related to the aphid insect pigments</field><field name="creator">joshua.mcmanus@epichem.com.au</field><field name="description">The naphtho[2,3-c]pyran ring system is generally found amongst natural products as the 5,10- or 6,9-quinones.  These compounds display a wide range of biological activities, and as such, have been synthesised by various research groups.  The synthetic work described in this thesis is directed towards finding shorter, more convergent routes to enantiopure quinone A 10, quinone A' 11 and quinone-pm 13, three derivatives of the aphid insect pigments protoaphin-fb 6, protoaphin-sl 7 and protoaphin-pm 9, respectively.

The first chapter describes the previous syntheses of some naphtho[2,3-c]pyrans including those relating to the aphid insect pigment derivatives.  Also detailed is the ability of these naphthopyranquinones to act as potential bioreductive alkylating and dialkylating agents.  The latter part of the chapter records some of the previously achieved assemblies of quinones A 10 and A' 11 in both racemic and enantiopure form, as well as the only synthesis of enantiopure quinone-pm 13.

Chapter 2 involves the preparation of regioselectively halogenated aryldioxolanes starting with the allylation of brominated and chlorinated phenols.   The isomerisation of these dioxolanes into the corresponding halogenated 2-benzopyrans is then investigated.

Chapter 3 examines the regioselectivity of the Diels-Alder reaction between protected benzopyranquinones and the substituted diene 1-methoxy-1,3-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)-buta-1,3-diene 80.  Such protection involves preparing the acetates and methoxymethyl ethers of the benzopyranquinones. The latter part of the chapter describes the direct bromination of benzopyranquinones.

Chapter 4 reports on the stereoselective reaction between metal phenolates and the chiral aldehyde 108 to subsequently afford naphthyldioxolanes 264, 291, 292 and 295.  The rearrangement reaction of the derived naphthyldioxolane 295 is then investigated.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090715.131733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Traversing the boundaries?

This thesis considers the dynamic of these conditions within a focused long-term study of the art and life of Indonesian &#147;Surealis&#148; painter, Lucia Hartini. My doctoral dissertation comprises this thesis and the forty-two minute documentary film Perbatasan / Boundaries: Lucia Hartini, Paintings from a Life (1999 &#150; 2002) which I filmed in Indonesia and presents Lucia Hartini and her art in the context of her times from the historical standpoint of Reformasi and millennial change. Art historically, this thesis informs us of a wider journey, that of selected twentieth century Indonesian contemporary artists exploring concepts of simulacra, hyper-reality, the meta-real and the surreal through the stylistic use of photo-realism.

Lucia Hartini is known for her &#147;Beautiful Surrealism&#148;. A founding member of the &#147;Surealis Yogya&#148;, formed in 1985, she was the only woman from the original group to continue painting professionally from the late 1970s, throughout the New Order, and into the era of Reform. The consideration of Lucia Hartini&#146;s work in this thesis acknowledges the gradual shift in her concerns. Lucia&#146;s paintings respond to her natural and social environment, as well as to the challenges and dramatic changes in her life. This thesis charts the journey of her artistic maturation, so richly embodied in her third solo exhibition, &#147;Irama Kehidupan / The Spirit of Life&#148;, in January 2002. Through a critical commentary on paintings selected from her oeuvre and the textual analysis of Perbatasan / Boundaries, I discuss Lucia Hartini&#146;s subject matter, unique systems of image formation and use of detail, her particular contribution to the characteristic qualities of Indonesian &#147;Surealisme&#148;. I regard the techniques, conceptual approaches and processes of filmmaking as intrinsic to this exploration, a methodological perspective arising from Hendro Wiyanto (2001) observation that Indonesia&#146;s &#147;Surealis&#148; artists present us with &#147;reality bundled as a dream&#148;.

Lucia Hartini&#146;s work raises questions of gender and personal transformation. This thesis argues that, for many years, the tensions created by the contrary forces of political repression and social transformation characterising much of New Order Indonesia, were reflected in her art. In a microcosmic-macrocosmic sense, Lucia and her art quietly contributed to attitudinal and social change in Indonesia. Works painted between 1986 and 1996 autobiographically chart a shift from personal distress to a growing sense of empowerment, followed by life-changing spiritual growth. I contextualize these paintings socially by studying the changing interstices between Lucia Hartini&#146;s private life, her professional creative practice and the public persona she adopted in Indonesia&#146;s emergent civilian society. My approach is informed by a conceptual framework based on difference, hybridity and its transformations, on the psychology of borderlands, negotiation and the transcendence of boundaries, witnessed through a study of the spiritual practice and quest for religious tolerance important to Lucia and evident in her art. This thesis reveals those boundaries which were transcended and those which remain negotiable.

Twice filming Lucia Hartini&#146;s art, I was also affected by the dramatically different conditions of production prevailing in 1992 in New Order Indonesia and those possible between 1999 and 2001 during Reformasi. These differences are highlighted in the textual analysis of Perbatasan / Boundaries. Engaging comparisons between contemporary Indonesian art and Indonesian documentary and feature films, I discuss important attempts to solve the problems associated with restrictions on freedom of expression in paintings made prior to Reformasi. I consider the different uses of figurative realism to depict subjects deemed controversial by the state, and the creation of credible representations in art and convincing characterisations in filmmaking. The dramatically real yet poetic work of the Indonesian Neo-realist filmmakers of the 1950s exemplified one such solution. Their films and ideas prompted comparisons with the photo-realism, poetic intent and dramatic juxtapositional image making of the &#147;Surealis Yogya&#148;. The relationship I perceive between Neo-realist cinematic practice and contemporary international documentary filmmaking encouraged me to make a documentary about Lucia rather than a purely creative or experimentally surreal work. Because of Reformasi and the changes wrought by Lucia&#146;s personal development, Perbatasan / Boundaries: Lucia Hartini, Paintings from a Life (1999 &#150; 2002) is the documentary which my first short experimental video, Pusaran / Vortex: From the Kitchen to Outer Space (1992 - 1993), made during the New Order, could not be.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090716.145044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparisons of the biological and genetic characteristics of the Mulloway Argyrosomus japonicus (Sciaenidae) in different regions of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">bryn_farmer@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">The research conducted for this thesis has produced quantitative data on the biology and population genetic structure of the Mulloway Argyrosomus japonicus in Western Australia, where this sciaenid is recreationally and commercially fished.

Also, there exists a widely accepted theory, called the 'cycle of violence', which hypothesises that children who have experienced violence at the hands of their parents tend to grow up to become violent parents themselves. Some evidence for this theory has been found following research with groups of abusive parents and people who have committed crimes, This study explores the specific impacts of childhood exposure to family violence on the subsequent mothering of a group of women drawn from the general population. A qualitative approach using a methodology that combined feminist and narrative approaches was used. Nine women who have been exposed to family violence in childhood including physical, emotional/psychological, sexual abuse and witness to violence between parents participated in interviews which explored their experiences of mothering
Each woman was interviewed twice to collect stories of childhood and of mothering experiences. These were analysed revealing that the women's mothering was affected by their childhood exposure to family violence in several ways, ranging from direct emotional impacts to indirect impacts of conceptualisations formed in the light of childhood experiences. This study adds to the existing knowledge of the long-term impacts of childhood exposure to family violence by focussing specifically on subsequent mothering. The findings encourage social work and health care personnel to appreciate that women exposed to family violence in childhood have specific issues with their mothering and there is a need to address these issues. It also challenges the weight given to the cycle of violence theory in intervention and prevention strategies in child abuse and family violence sectors</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Domestic violence</field><field name="subject">mothering</field><field name="subject">motherhood</field><field name="subject">childhood abuse</field><field name="subject">long-term impacts of child abuse</field><field name="subject">long-term impacts of family violence</field><field name="subject">long-term impacts of domestic violence</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20090710.150411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Br&#248;ondal's system of grammar : a translation of, and commentary on, Morfologi Og Syntax (1932)</field><field name="creator">Hallon, Robert J.

It unpacks how an invitation to film an unusual and life-changing event developed into an opportunity to question the ethics of the interview. It examines how the intricacies of a trust relationship influence the very threads and textures of the resulting documentary. This paper is a partnership between a practical documentary project and a more traditional written discussion. The documentary Five Hours with Raja is weighted at eighty per cent of the final thesis and the written exegesis makes up the remaining twenty per cent. Together these two elements investigate the developing relationship between Claudia &#8211; the documentary&#8217;s key protagonist, and the filmmaker, investigating how their relationship has affected the style, method, content and even the fundamental story line of a documentary. It also discusses the consequential ethical considerations and dilemmas behind creative and practical decisions, investigating ways that a filmmaker can draw the participant into the process to allow a greater degree of ownership, a stronger voice and a more immediate sense of intimacy with the final audience.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Documentary</field><field name="subject">Interview</field><field name="subject">Ethics</field><field name="subject">Participant</field><field name="subject">Death</field><field name="subject">Baby loss</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/685</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework for social capital : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Palmerton [i.e. Palmerston] North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kibblewhite, Andrew</field><field name="description">This dissertation is concerned with enhancing the utility of social capital by developing and testing a comprehensive and measurable framework as a tool for researchers, policy-makers, and development theorists and practitioners. A framework was developed for measuring the degree to which different forms of social capital reside in a community and for distinguishing community-to community variations. The Framework was also designed to identify the accumulation of social capital in relation to structural characteristics within a community, and to identify what advantages might be associated with variants of social capital. The pursuit of the understanding of social capital has been convened within narrow disciplinary fields and has reduced the notion in definition, purpose, and utility. Much of the literature and past research has focused on approximations to identify social capital that are field-specific and representative of, at best, markers of social capital, rather than social capital itself. For this reason, this dissertation is concerned with developing a robust framework that has the potential to embrace the nature and extent of social capital across these disciplinary fields, while providing insight into the forms, influences, and trajectories of social capital. The utility of the Social Capital Framework that was developed for this dissertation was examined by transforming the Framework into a survey tool for administering in two communities to identify applicability and sensitivity for identifying the degree to which variants of social capital reside. The results showed that the Framework was able to distinguish the degree to which different forms of social capital existed, and how the social capital accumulates in relations to structural variables, in particular, gender. The Framework&#8217;s utility was not universal across all forms of social capital and showed that further enhancements are required, particularly, if it is to enable social capital to be attributed to forms of advantage. The results also identified areas where future research would be of value, particularly, in examining the trajectory of people&#8217;s forms of social capital.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social capital framework</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">development studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340213 Economic development and growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/939</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding aspects of andesitic dome-forming eruptions through the last 1000 yrs of volcanism at Mt. Taranaki, New Zealand : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Earth Science, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Platz, Thomas</field><field name="description">Andesitic volcanoes are notorious for their rapid and unpredictable changes in eruptive style between and during volcanic events, a feature normally attributed to shallow crustal and intra-edifice magmatic processes. Using the example of eruptions during the last 1000 yrs at Mt. Taranaki (the Maero Eruptive Period), deposit sequences were studied to (1) understand lava dome formation and destruction, (2) interpret the causes of rapid shifts from extrusive to explosive eruption styles, and (3) to build a model of crustal magmatic processes that impact on eruption style. A new detailed reconstruction of this period identifies at least 10 eruptive episodes characterised by extrusive, lava dome- and lava flow-producing events and one sub- Plinian eruption. To achieve this, a new evaluation procedure was developed to purge glass datasets of contaminated mineral-glass analyses by using compositional diagrams of mineral incompatible-compatible elements. Along with careful examination of particle textures, this procedure can be broadly applied to build a higher degree of resolution in any tephrostratigraphic record. Geochemical contrasts show that the products of the latest Mt. Taranaki eruption, the remnant summit dome (Pyramid Dome) was not formed during the Tahurangi eruptive episode but extruded post-AD1755. Its inferred original maximum volume of 4.9&#215;106 m3 (DRE) was formed by simultaneous endogenous and exogenous dome growth within days. Magma ascent and extrusion rates are estimated at =0.012 ms-1 and =6 m3s-1, respectively, based on hornblende textures. Some of the Maero-Period dome effusions were preceded by a vent-clearing phase producing layers of scattered lithic lapilli around the edifice [Newall Ash (a), Mangahume Lapilli, Pyramid Lapilli]. The type of dome failure controlled successive eruptive phases in most instances. The destruction of a pressurised dome either caused instantaneous but short-lived magmatic fragmentation (Newall and Puniho episodes), or triggered a directed blast-explosion (Newall episode), or initiated sustained magmatic fragmentation (Burrell Episode). The transition from dome effusion to a sustained, sub- Plinian eruption during the Burrell Lapilli (AD1655) episode was caused by unroofing a conduit of stalled magma, vertically segregated into three layers with different degrees of vesiculation and crystallisation. The resultant ejecta range from brown, grey and black coloured vesicular clasts to dense grey lithics. Bulk compositional variation of erupted clasts can be modelled by fractionation of hornblende, plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and Fe-Ti oxides. Pre-eruption magma ascent for the Maero Period events is assumed to begin at depths of c.9.5 km.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">volcanism</field><field name="subject">volcanic eruptions</field><field name="subject">Mount Taranaki</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260103 Vulcanology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/938</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DFT calculations on the interaction of phosphazenes with transition metals : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Chemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North</field><field name="creator">Davidson, Ross James</field><field name="description">The electronic structure of substituted cyclic phosphazenes has been investigated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Natural Bond Order (NBO) analysis. NBO analysis shows covalent, ionic and negative hyper-conjugation interactions all contribute to the electronic structure of cyclic phosphazenes. The geometric and electronic structural changes that occur when transition metals are coordinated to the nitrogen atom of the phosphazene ring have been analyzed using the NBO model. The bonding of transition metal ions with the ring nitrogen on the phosphazene was investigated by modeling hexakis(2-pyridyloxy)cyclotriphosphazene, hexakis(4-methyl-2-pyridyloxy)cyclotriphosphazene and octakis(2- pyridyloxy)cyclotetraphosphazene with different metal ions (Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II)) in their assorted configurations with DFT as implemented in the Gaussian03 package. First-row transition metals bind to the phosphazene ring with simple s donor behaviour via the ring nitrogen. The lengthening of the PN bonds adjacent to the coordinated metal centre is a result of electron density being removed from the PN bonding orbitals and going into the 4s orbital of the metal ion. Investigating the pyridine substituents on the phosphazene ring showed that these can affect the PN bonds in a similar fashion, although weaker, to the transition metals. This effect is the result of the pyridine nitrogen lone pair affecting the negative hyperconjugation component of the PN bond. Coupling between two metal atoms coordinated to the phosphazene ring was investigated by DFT calculations, which showed molecular orbitals in both the tricyclic and tetracyclic phosphazene capable of providing an &#8216;electron density bridge&#8217; between the metal centres. These results are in accord with ESR and magnetic susceptibility results, which can be explained in terms of weak antiferromagnetic coupling between metal ions. The cyclic phosphazenes are model compounds for polyphosphazenes and the results obtained from this work will provide insight into the electronic properties of this important class of inorganic polymers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phosphazenes</field><field name="subject">transitional metals</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250200 Inorganic Chemistry::250201 Transition metal chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The behaviour and design of thin walled concrete filled steel box columns</field><field name="creator">Mursi, Mohanad, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the behaviour of hollow and concrete filled steel columns fabricated from thin steel plates. The columns are investigated under axial, uniaxial and biaxial loading. The currently available international standards for composite structures are limited to the design of concrete filled steel columns with compact sections and yield stress of steel up to 460 N/mm2. This thesis consists of both experimental and analytical studies and design recommendations for future use. Three comprehensive series of experimental tests are conducted on hollow and concrete filled steel columns. The principal parameters that have been considered in the test programmes are the slenderness of the component plates, the yield stress of the steel and the loading conditions. In the first test series, three slender hollow steel columns and three slender composite columns are tested under uniaxial loading. The steel utilised is mild steel. High strength steel is utilised in the second test programme. In this test series four stub columns, eight short columns and eight slender columns are tested, each set consists of four hollow and four composite columns. Short columns are tested under axial loading to investigate the confinement effect provided by the steel casing. Slender columns are tested under uniaxial loading to investigate the coupled instability of local and global buckling. The third test programme is quite novel and considers the behaviour of hollow and concrete filled steel columns fabricated with high strength structural steel plate and subjected to biaxial bending. In this test eight short columns and ten slender columns each of them consisting of hollow and composite columns are investigated under biaxial loading.  Analytical models are developed herein to elucidate the behaviour of the hollow and composite columns considering cross section slenderness, yield stress and loading conditions. An iterative model considering the coupled global and local buckling in the elastic and plastic range incorporating material nonlinearities is developed to investigate the behaviour of slender columns fabricated from mild steel. An improved deformation control model is developed to investigate the behaviour of slender high strength steel columns considering the confinement effect and local and post-local buckling in the elastic and plastic range. Then a numerical model for biaxial bending is developed to study the behaviour of short and slender concrete filled high strength steel columns under biaxial loading incorporating interaction buckling considering material and geometric nonlinearities. The scope of the thesis presents a wide range of experimental and theoretical studies of an extremely novel nature. It demonstrates the benefit of confinement and the consideration of local and post-local buckling in the elastic and plastic range. It is hoped that this research will contribute to the area of composite steel-concrete structural applications.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Structural analysis (Engineering)</field><field name="subject">Composite construction.</field><field name="subject">Columns, Iron and steel.</field><field name="subject">Columns, Concrete -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Strains and stresses -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40494</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantum dots and radio-frequency electrometry in silicon.</field><field name="creator">Angus, Susan J., Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development and demonstration of a new technique for the fabrication of well-defined quantum dots in a bulk silicon substrate, for potential applications such as quantum computation in coupled quantum dots. Hall characterisation was performed on double-gated mesaMetal-Oxide- Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate, for the purpose of silicon quantum dots in etched nanowires on SOI. Carrier density and mobility results are presented, demonstrating top- and backgate control over the two inversion layers created at the upper and lower surfaces of the superficial silicon mesa. A new technique is developed enabling effective depletion gating of quantum dots in a bulk silicon substrate. A lower layer of aluminium gates is defined using electron beam lithography; the surface of these gates is oxidised using a plasma oxidation technique; and a further layer of aluminium gates is deposited. The lower gates form tunable tunnel barriers in the narrow inversion layer channel created by the upper MOSFET gate. The two layers of gates are electrically isolated by the localised layer of aluminium oxide. Low-temperature transport spectroscopy has been performed in both the many electron (&#8764;100 electrons) and the few electron (&#8764;10 electrons) regimes.Excited states in the bias spectroscopy provide evidence of quantum confinement. Preliminary temperature and magnetic field dependence data are presented. These results demonstrate that depletion gates are an effective technique for defining quantum dots in silicon. Furthermore, the demonstration of the first silicon radio-frequency single electron transistor is reported. The island is again defined by electrostatically tunable tunnel barriers in a narrow channel field effect transistor. Charge sensitivities of better than 10&#956;e/&#8730;Hz are demonstrated at MHz bandwidth. These results establish that silicon may be used to fabricate fast, sensitive electrometers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quantum dots</field><field name="subject">Silicon-on-insulator technology</field><field name="subject">Metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Connecting genotype to phenotype: drosophila simulans mitochondria as a model.</field><field name="creator">Melvin, Richard G, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The influence of genotype variation on phenotype has been a longstanding question in biology but it is now one of the greatest challenges of the post-genomics era. Discovering the link between common gene variants that affect phenotypes within and between populations is likely to provide insight into the molecular physiology of phenotypic traits and the mechanisms by which they evolve. The overall goal of this thesis is to link naturally occurring genotypic variation with the organism??s phenotype. The specific goal of this thesis is to connect natural variation in the mitochondrial genotype with the organismal phenotype using the model organism Drosophila simulans.  Mitochondria are intracellular organelles found in most eukaryotes and produce over 90% of the energy needed by cells. Determining the connection of mitochondrial genotype to whole organism phenotype is of particular interest because of the broad use of mitochondrial (mt) DNA as a molecular marker in evolutionary biology and population genetics, the organelle??s central role in cellular energy production, the potential for the mitochondria to influence organismal distribution particularly in the face of climate change and in human degenerative disease. I use the model organism D. simulans because it has high genetic variability, can be easily sampled from the wild and manipulated in the lab, and the energy producing reactions that take place in its mitochondria are highly conserved among metazoa. I studied naturally occurring mutations to understand the influence of these changes in natural populations.  The four studies in this thesis have employed a Genotype-Biochemistry-Phenotype (GBP) model to link naturally occurring variation in the mitochondrial genotype with organism phenotype in D. simulans mitochondria. Three major conclusions can be drawn from the thesis that follow the genotype to biochemistry to phenotype model. Firstly, a subset of the mutations in genes that comprise the mitochondrial genotype is functionally significant. Secondly, the biochemical efficiency of OXPHOS is regulated by mitochondrial homeostasis. Thirdly, key organismal life history traits influenced by the mitochondrial genotype and this is mediated through the biochemistry of OXPHOS.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genotype</field><field name="subject">Phenotype</field><field name="subject">Mitochondria</field><field name="subject">mtDNA</field><field name="subject">Drosophila</field><field name="subject">Candidate complex approach</field><field name="subject">Cytochrome c oxidase</field><field name="subject">Metabolism</field><field name="subject">Drosophilidae</field><field name="subject">Genotype-environment interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41463</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Online legal services - a revolution that failed?</field><field name="creator">Burns, Christine Vanda, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the late 1990s a number of law firms and other organisations began to market online products which &amp;quotpackage&amp;quot legal knowledge. Unlike spreadsheets, word processing software and email, these products are not designed to provide efficiency improvements. Rather, online legal knowledge products, which package and apply the law, were and are viewed by many as having the potential to make major changes to legal practice. Many used the term &amp;quitrevolution&amp;quot to describe the anticipated impact. Like any new technology development, many intersecting factors contributed to their development. In many ways they built on existing uses of technology in legal practice. The various information technology paradigms which underpin them - text retrieval, expert systems/artificial intelligence, document automation, computer aided instruction (CAI) and hypertext - were already a part of the &amp;quotcomputerisation of law&amp;quot. What is new about online legal knowledge products is that as well as using technology paradigms such as expert systems or document automation to package and apply the law, they are developed using browser-based technologies. In this way they leverage the comparative ease of development and distribution capabilities of the Internet (and/or intranets). There has been particular interest in the impact of online legal knowledge products on the legal services provided to large commercial organisations. With the increasing burden of corporate compliance, expanding role of the in-house lawyer and pressure to curb costs, online legal knowledge products should flourish in commercial organisations and many have been adamant that they will. However, there is no convincing evidence that anything like a &amp;quotrevolution&amp;quot has taken place. Success stories are few and far between. Surprisingly few have asked whether this &amp;quotrevolution&amp;quot has failed, or seriously analysed whether it lies ahead. If it does lie ahead, what factors, if any, need to taken into account in order for it to take place? If there is to be no revolution, what value should be placed on online legal knowledge products? In this dissertation I use the findings of my own empirical work, supported by a literature survey, to demonstrate that the impact of online legal knowledge products has been modest. I argue that in order to build successful online legal knowledge products it is necessary to appreciate that a complex system of interacting factors underpins their development and use,and address those factors. I propose a schematic representation of the relationships involved in producing an online legal knowledge product and use the findings of some empirical work, together with a review the literature in related fields, to identify the factors relevant to the various components of this framework. While there are many interacting factors at play, four sets of considerations emerge from my research as particularly important: integrating different technology paradigms, knowledge acquisition, usability, and implementation. As a practical matter, the implication of these findings is that some online legal knowledge products are more likely to be successful than others, and that there are other technology applications that may represent a better investment of the limited in-house technology budget than many online legal knowledge products. I also argue that while most of the challenges involved in integrating different technology paradigms, improving usability, and effective implementation can be addressed with varying levels of effort, the problem of the knowledge acquisition bottleneck is intractable. New approaches to knowledge acquisition are required to overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. I identify some potential approaches that emerge from my research: automation, collaboration and coalition, phasing and simple solutions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Legal services.</field><field name="subject">Law -- Information services.</field><field name="subject">Law -- Computer network resources.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32468</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geology, geochemistry and evolution of the Esfordi Phosphate - Iron Deposit, Bafq Area, Central Iran</field><field name="creator">Jami, Morteza, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Esfordi is a Kiruna-type Fe???P oxide deposit in the Bafq district of Iran. It formed within a predominantly rhyolitic volcanic sequence that formed in a continental margin tectonic regime and is of Cambrian age. The gently dipping, stratabound ore body is lenticular and displays a well-developed mineralogical zonal pattern. The Fe-oxide rich core contains a central zone of massive magnetite and a more hematitic brecciated rim. The overlying P-rich ore body contains massive and brecciated, apatite-rich variants with accessory hematite and actinolite. A zone of apatite-bearing veins and disseminations envelopes the Fe-oxide and P-rich zones and extends into overlying volcaniclastics that contain detrital magnetite ?? apatite clasts. The main ore zones are surrounded by Ca-rich alteration, dominated by actinolite, extending ~100 m into the more permeable overlying volcaniclastics. Beyond this envelope is widespread development of secondary K-feldspar. Mesoscopic and microscopic observations reveal a paragenetic sequence containing four generations of apatite. The early stage is a LREE-rich apatite 1 that occurs within the massive and brecciated magnetite core. The second generation is large and brecciated apatite 2, associated with hematite and actinolite. Both apatite 1 and 2 exhibit widespread dissolution and reprecipitation to form a LREE-poor granular apatite that is generally associated with quartz-carbonate??REE minerals. The final stage involved an overprint of LREE-poor apatite 3-carbonate-quartz-actinolite-chlorite-epidote??bastnaesite??synchesite extending into the host rocks. Fluid inclusions in apatite 1 have homogenisation temperatures of 375-425oC and indicate salinities of 14???18 wt. % NaCl. The magnetite displays low ???????O of -0.1???1.7 ???, suggesting precipitation from fluids with ???????O of 7.8???9.6 ??? at ~400oC, consistent with a magmatic source. Fluid inclusions in apatite 2 homogenise between 195???295oC with indicated salinities of 13???19 wt. % NaCl. The associated hematite displays ???????O of -0.2???2.3 ??? which would be in equilibrium with fluids having a ???????O of 10.7???13.0 ??? at ~250oC. Such enriched isotopic fluids suggest interaction of magmatic fluids with cooler saline fluids that were probably derived from the underlying carbonate-rich sequences. Fluid inclusions in apatite 3 and quartz homogenise at 145???155oC and, together with a quartz ???????O of 16.0???17.1 ???, suggests precipitation from a fluid with ???????O of -0.7???2.1 ??? that is likely to have resulted from the introduction of a cooler, less saline and isotopically depleted fluid (such as sea water). The results of this study clearly indicate a significant role for fluids in the evolution of the Esfordi deposit but do not preclude a role for immiscible Fe-oxide???P-rich melts in the initial stages of the mineralising process.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geology - Iran</field><field name="subject">Geochemistry - Iran</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a new framework for a House Rating Scheme (HRS)</field><field name="creator">Kordjamshidi, Maria, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">There has long been concern that rating the thermal performance of buildings on the basis of predicted normalized energy requirement (MJ/m2) is inappropriate for achieving overall energy efficient design of houses, mainly due to the inability of such schemes to deal with the evaluation of passive architectural design in the form of free running buildings. This study, investigating the shortcomings in the current rating schemes, hypothesizes that the main reason for that inability is due to significant differences between efficient design for free running and conditioned houses. It also suggests that a multiple occupancy scenario, involving variable occupation times and zones, is an important parameter for improving the accuracy of any building evaluation system.  The study aims to propose a new method for House Rating Schemes in which the efficiency of a house design will be evaluated with reference to its thermal performance in both free running and conditioned operation modes. By attributing more value to the performance of houses in the free running than the conditioned operation, it is assumed that policy objectives for reducing energy demand for space heating and cooling in the residential building sector are more likely to be achieved.  Simulation was used to compare the predicted thermal performances of houses in free running and conditioned operation modes for the moderate climates of Sydney and Canberra. Parametric sensitivity analysis and multivariate regression analysis have been employed and point to the following results.  The reliability of a free running rating scheme, in terms of addressing energy efficient aspects, as compared to the current energy based rating schemes, is demonstrated. The research illustrates significant differences between efficient design for conditioned houses and for free running houses. The findings strongly suggest the necessity of developing a new regulatory framework for reducing energy demand in the housing sector. Utilizing these findings, an aggregation of two rating systems for the purpose of creating a new house rating framework has been developed. It is assumed that this research approach is likely to deliver significant benefits in terms of reduction in energy demand and increased sustainability, if it is employed as a basis for House Ratings Schemes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Energy auditing.</field><field name="subject">Housing -- Australia -- Energy conservation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language of love in culture of silence: Iranian women???s sexual understandings and sociocultural context</field><field name="creator">Merghati Khoei, Effat, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sexuality is a culturally embedded phenomenon that needs in-depth exploration. Quantifying people???s sexuality without examining it through their own eyes is not enough to allow us to address sexual health goals. This qualitative study explored the development of the sexual understandings of Iranian women who migrated to Australia after the age of 16. The study used women???s life history and sexual stories as the foundation for understanding their experiences, perceptions and beliefs with the aim of contributing to the literature on women???s health, sexual health and sexual development. Data for this study was collected from 2003 to early 2005 using a multi-method design incorporating informal ethnographic encounters, five focus group discussions with 33 women aged 19 to 82, and 22 in-depth individual interviews. Thematic and narrative analyses explored the information elicited. The findings showed considerable individual variation in women???s life experiences. Nonetheless, all sought reproductive sexuality within heterosexual marriage. The language women used to express sexuality shaped their sexual understandings and expression of sexuality. Childhood experiences were shown to be important to the development of gender identity and awareness of sexuality, and revealed the family management of sexuality during childhood. Puberty and its intensive social management contributed to women???s overall understandings of gender role, sex role and sexual self-image as ???a precious sexual being???. Finally, sexual selfhood was transformed through the institution of marriage, leading to the acquisition of sexual subjectivity understood in sometimes conflicting terms as a ???proper wife??? and/or a ???sexually successful woman???. Sexuality in later life and the impact of attitudes to menopause on women???s sense of self, especially sexual self-negation, were also explored. The study revealed the inadequacy of a cultural influence model of sexuality built on an essentialist biological base, showing that even women???s ability to experience sexual sensation was culturally constructed. On the foundation of androcentricity, women???s sexuality is regulated and silenced at both the individual and social levels. Finally, some suggestions are made for sexual health care in multicultural settings like Australia and for social change to address the empowerment and sexual agency of women.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">B-SCP: an integrated approach for validating alignment of organizational IT requirements with competitive business strategy</field><field name="creator">Bleistein, Steven J, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Strategic alignment of IT exists when a business organization???s goals and processes are in harmony with the IT software and systems that support them. Evidence shows that effective strategic alignment leads to superior financial performance of companies. Hence, CIOs and IT executives consistently rank alignment of IT with business strategy as a top priority in numerous surveys. Despite its importance to industry, strategic alignment has largely been ignored by requirements engineering research. The objective of the research presented in this thesis is to develop and test B-SCP, a requirements engineering analytical framework to help ensure that system requirements of organizational IT are in alignment with and provide support for competitive business strategy. B-SCP combines requirements engineering methods for formalizing and reasoning about software with analytical frameworks for competitive business strategy. Goal modeling, problem diagrams, and business process modeling, techniques typically used in isolation in requirements engineering, are integrated in a coherent framework. VMOST analysis, a management tool for organizational alignment, is used to elicit business strategy from executives. The Business Rules Group???s Model for Organizational Motivation is used to provide guidance for constructing a goal model to represent business strategy. A business modeling framework proposed in management research on e-business systems, is used to define the boundaries of scope for the organizational IT requirements problem. B-SCP is evaluated and validated by two worked examples using data on completed, strategic IT projects of significant scale and complexity, occurring in different industrial application domains. The second worked example includes evaluation based on expert feedback from a major, IT executive stakeholder in the original project. This research concludes that B-SCP provides a credible solution to the industrial problem of validating organizational IT requirements against business strategy. This thesis makes a significant contribution to the field of requirements engineering research, in which issues of business strategy and strategic alignment have gone unaddressed. In addition, this thesis presents a potentially practical, real-world solution to the major, ongoing challenge of business- IT strategic alignment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of antibacterial contact lenses on inflammatory responses in a guinea pig model</field><field name="creator">Vijay, Ajay Kumar, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Contact Lens Acute Red Eye (CLARE) and Infiltrative Keratitis (IK) are inflammatory responses of the eye associated with extended wear of soft contact lenses. Bacterial colonization of contact lenses with Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important risk factor for the development of these adverse responses. Strategies that control the bacterial colonization of contact lenses may help prevent the occurrence of adverse responses. This thesis aimed to develop an animal model of CLARE/IK to test this hypothesis and to test the effectiveness of contact lenses containing antimicrobial compounds, namely silver and furanone compounds, in controlling corneal inflammation caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  A guinea pig model of contact lens wear was developed for the study and it was observed that the ocular responses to contact lens wear in the guinea pig were similar to those seen in human eyes wearing contact lenses. Also, three different models for CLARE/IK were developed and tested in the guinea pig eye. The pathological features of CLARE/IK in the guinea pig were virtually identical to those observed in human eyes. Bacterial contamination of contact lenses was confirmed to be a major risk factor for the development of CLARE/IK.  Contact lenses containing nano-particles of silver demonstrated very good antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in-vitro. The silver lenses were able to control the development of CLARE/IK responses in one of the models for CLARE/IK. Silver lenses might be most effective if used to prevent the establishment of a biofilm of bacteria on a lens such as might occur during storage in a contact lens case. Contact lenses were coated with different concentrations of the furanone compounds by physical adsorption and demonstrated good antibacterial activity at higher concentrations. However these concentrations were cytotoxic in-vitro and lower concentrations of furanones did not possess adequate antibacterial activity to control CLARE/IK responses in-vivo.  This thesis has successfully demonstrated that guinea pigs can be used to test the effects of extended wear of contact lenses and developed models to test the pathogenesis of adverse responses such as CLARE/IK. The CLARE/IK models developed could be used to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of these inflammatory conditions and explore the activity of other antimicrobials.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Contact lenses.</field><field name="subject">Guinea pigs as laboratory animals.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sharing network measurements on peer-to-peer networks</field><field name="creator">Fan, Bo, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">With the extremely rapid development of the Internet in recent years, emerging peer-to-peer network overlays are meeting the requirements of a more sophisticated communications environment, providing a useful substrate for applications such as scalable file sharing, data storage, large-scale multicast, web-cache, and publish-subscribe services. Due to its design flexibility, peer-to-peer networks can offer features including self-organization, fault-tolerance, scalability, load-balancing, locality and anonymity. As the Internet grows, there is an urgent requirement to understand real-time network performance degradation. Measurement tools currently used are ping, traceroute and variations of these. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is also used by network administrators to monitor local networks. However, ping and traceroute can only be used temporarily, SNMP can only be deployed at certain points in networks and these tools are incapable of sharing network measurements among end-users. Due to the distributed nature of networking performance data, peer-to-peer overlay networks present an attractive platform to distribute this information among Internet users.  This thesis aims at investigating the desirable locality property of peer-to-peer overlays to create an application to share Internet measurement performance. When measurement data are distributed amongst users, it needs to be localized in the network allowing users to retrieve it when external Internet links fail. Thus, network locality and robustness are the most desirable properties. Although some unstructured overlays also integrate locality in design, they fail to reach rarely located data items. Consequently, structured overlays are chosen because they can locate a rare data item deterministically and they can perform well during network failures. In structured peer-to-peer overlays, Tapestry, Pastry and Chord with proximity neighbour selection, were studied due to their explicit notion of locality. To differentiate the level of locality and resiliency in these protocols, P2Psim simulations were performed. The results show that Tapestry is the more suitable peer-to-peer substrate to build such an application due to its superior localizing data performance. Furthermore, due to the routing similarity between Tapestry and Pastry, an implementation that shares network measurement information was developed on freepastry, verifying the application feasibility. This project also contributes to the extension of P2Psim to integrate with GT-ITM and link failures.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Locality.</field><field name="subject">Peer-to-Peer Networks.</field><field name="subject">Network measurements.</field><field name="subject">Peer-to-peer architecture (Computer networks)</field><field name="subject">Computer networks.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unobtrusive monitoring of health status of elderly people living alone at home</field><field name="creator">Kaushik, Alka Rani, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the hypothesis that unobtrusive monitoring of daily living could be used to evaluate changes in the health status of frail elderly people living alone at home. Low cost motion sensors can be used for monitoring the long term trends in occupant?s well-being in terms of physical, mental, social and environmental factors. The monitored data can be used to quantitatively measure parameters that can provide insight into the level of activity and functional ability of the subject.  Any deviations in these parameters can provide information on the changing health status of the subject.  This thesis attempts for the first time to establish a mathematical and statistical framework for the monitoring of functional health status in the home using a network of wireless sensors to monitor occupancy in each room of the house. A low power and low cost, unobtrusive occupancy monitoring system using ZigBee wireless technology and passive infrared sensors has been developed by the Biomedical Systems Laboratory at the University of New South Wales. The essence of the occupancy monitoring system is to detect variations in the activities of daily living (ADL) of elderly people living alone at home.  The finite state, discrete parameter, time homogeneous Markov chain represents a theoretical framework for an unobtrusive occupancy monitoring system. An implementation of this framework for monitoring occupancy pattern is presented in real time use. The system was evaluated in a series of field studies in laboratory and home environment, in supervised and unsupervised settings, using cohorts of healthy elderly subjects living alone in their homes in community dwelling setting. A pilot trial was conducted in which four healthy elderly subjects living alone had PIR motion sensors installed in their homes at strategic points for a period of up to 13 weeks. The functionality of the system was evaluated over a domain of basic daily activities. A profile of the activities, in real time environment, for different times and days was stored as transition probability matrices. Automatic techniques for interpreting the test data captured by the system in terms of human movements were evaluated and compared with the wellness profile of the subject. Trial results exhibited that clinically significant model parameters were able to detect longitudinal deviations in the functional health status of elderly people.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Monitoring Health Status.</field><field name="subject">Older people.</field><field name="subject">Detectors.</field><field name="subject">Health.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40771</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SHELL-SIDE FLUID DYNAMICS AND MASS TRANSFER THROUGH HOLLOW FIBRE MEMBRANE MODULES</field><field name="creator">Costello, Michael John, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">There is a considerable volume of work available in literature which suggests that the performance of axial-flow hollow fibre membrane modules is limited by poorly distributed flow through the shell-side.  This study was commissioned to examine the distribution of shell-side flow and its effect on mass transfer and to compare the performance measured by the axial-flow configuration to that obtained by a commonly used alternative known as the helically-wound module design.  Laminar flow and mass transfer models have been developed to examine performance through axial-flow hollow fibre modules.  These models also consider deviations from laminar flow in the form of turbulence and hydrodynamically undeveloped flow.  Modelling analysis on four fibre bundle cross-sections quantify the extent to which channelling limits flow and mass transfer performance.  Experimental flow and mass transfer work with locally fabricated hollow fibre modules demonstrated some inconsistencies with axial laminar flow modelling.  Pressure drop and mass transfer results exceeded predictions from modelling.  This thesis has hypothesised that fibres in axial-flow hollow fibre modules are not aligned as straight and parallel rods (as assumed in modelling) but interweave.  Fibre interweaving results in flows between ducts.  Such flows create mixing between ducts which results in more intimate contact between the flow and membrane surface, the consequence being higher pressure drop and higher mass transfer.  The implication from this work was that axial flow and mass transfer modelling was limited in its use for characterisation of shell-side performance.  The experience with helically-wound hollow fibre membrane modules (also fabricated locally) was that, by deliberately inducing flow between ducts, it was possible to considerably improve mass transfer performance.  It was found that, whilst helically-wound modules could not be packed as tightly as axial-flow modules and required more sophisticated fabrication techniques, the benefit in their use arose from a substantial improvement in the level of shell-side mass transfer.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">mass transfer</field><field name="subject">membranes</field><field name="subject">membrane technology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations of ??universality plus difference??  as being a ??partial way of seeing??</field><field name="creator">Bacic, Anita, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">My body of work described in this thesis is a demonstration of my continued fascination as an artist with the cosmopolitanist outlook on life. In particular, the elements within this cosmopolitanist framework of universality and difference and their coexistence, as described by Kwame Anthony Appiah, are used as a means of exploring a partial way of seeing. This is explored by a series of works: OneSixty Characters, Roaming Sweets, Ringe Raja, and the final set of works using the camera obscura technique (Accidental Surveillance, Outside In, and Outside In/Inside Out). Universality is explored through the use of a number of cultural, and, in the case of the initial works, various technological means. Cultural devices used included nursery rhymes/songs, story-telling and archetypal imagery. Technological explorations included use of moving images, mobile phones, Bluetooth hardware and the Internet. Other elements of the universal included the dome??s representation of the world and moving cloud animations as depicted in Ringe Raja and natural light ?? the main feature of the last set of works.  The elements of difference presented included linguistic and cultural differences, and ultimately each individual??s own personal experiences. It is this that sets each of us apart from one another, and provides for each of us a partial way of seeing that is unique to ourselves. By exploring works that encourage us to seek answers to the way we look, see, and interpret the world around us, we use that which is familiar to us to try to find the answers. This is particularly relevant to the final work which removed all forms of contemporary technology and used natural light to provide a place for contemplation, where familiar sounds, images and our own archive of experiences was used as a reference base to assist in the interpretation of what was being experienced.  The intention of the work was not to provide all the answers to questions that arise among participants, but to encourage contemplation, an interaction with the environment, and with others.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epigenetic changes in breast cancer</field><field name="creator">Hinshelwood, Rebecca, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, UNSW</field><field name="description">Changes in the epigenetic landscape are widespread in neoplasia, with de novo methylation and histone repressive marks commonly occurring in association with gene silencing.  However, understanding the dynamics of epigenetic changes is often hindered due to the absence of adequate in vitro model systems that accurately reflect events occurring in vivo.  Human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) grown under standard culture conditions enter a growth arrest termed selection, but a subpopulation is able to escape from arrest and continue to proliferate.  These cells, called post-selection cells, have many of the hallmarks seen in the earliest lesions of breast cancer, including transcriptional silencing and hypermethylation of the p16INK4A tumour suppressor gene.  The overall aim of my thesis was to use post-selection HMECs as model system to identify and dissect the mechanism involved in early epigenetic aberrations.  Firstly, using a microarray approach, I found that multiple members of the TGF-&#946; signalling pathway were concordantly suppressed in post-selection cells, and this was associated with functional disruption of the TGF-&#946; pathway.  Interestingly, concordant gene suppression was not associated with aberrant DNA methylation, but with repressive chromatin remodelling.  Secondly, to further understand the mechanism underpinning epigenetic silencing, I demonstrated using laser capture technology, that p16INK4A silencing is a precursor to DNA methylation and histone remodelling.  Thirdly, I found that individual post-selection HMEC strains during the early passages shared a common 'wave' pattern of regional-specific methylation within the p16INK4A CpG island.  Interestingly, the 'wave' pattern of early de novo methylation correlated with the apparent footprint of nucleosomes within the p16INK4A CpG island.  Lastly, to further characterise the properties of the HMEC culture system, I demonstrated that post-selection cells do not possess a natural tumour-inducing property when transplanted into the mammary fat pad of immunocompromised mice.  However, post-selection HMECs were associated with high expression of a variety of stem/progenitor markers, as well as stem/progenitor associated polycomb genes, thus demonstrating that these cells share some common features of stem/progenitor cells.  The research presented in this thesis demonstrate that epigenetic changes occur early in the growth of post-selection HMECs and many of these changes are common in breast cancer.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chromatin remodelling</field><field name="subject">Epigenetics</field><field name="subject">DNA methylation</field><field name="subject">Mechanism</field><field name="subject">Breast cancer</field><field name="subject">Human mammary epithelial cells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Police misconduct, regulation, and accountability : conflict of interest complaints against Victoria Police officers 1988???1998</field><field name="creator">Davids, Cindy, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">Conflict of interest allegations became a prominent part of the political and public sector in the 1980s and 1990s in Australia and elsewhere. The arena of policing was not immune, and in Victoria, the Ombudsman drew particular attention to the problem and expressed concern about the rise in public complaints relating to alleged conflicts of interest on the part of police officers. Against this background, permission was granted by Victoria Police for a major study of conflict of interest complaints against police officers within their jurisdiction. Access was granted to all public complaint case files where conflict of interest was the focus of the allegations, from the period 1988???1998. A total of 377 usable complaints files were examined, involving 539 police officers. Through extensive examination and analysis of these complaint case files, a comprehensive map of the particular kinds of interest involved, the nature of the conflicts with official police duties, and the particular contexts within which conflicts of interest emerged, was developed. Analysis of the case files identified 25 different types of problems related to conflict of interest. These were spread across the private and public realms of police officers??? involvements. Previous studies of conflict of interest have focused largely on the opportunities for misconduct arising in the public realm of police work and police duty, largely neglecting attention to the private realm of the relationships and involvements of a police officer that give rise to conflicts of interest. In this study, the specific private interests that gave rise to problems were able to be identified in 35 percent of all cases. Three broad problem areas were identified: (i) outside employment, private business interests, political, social, and sporting interests and involvements; (ii) family-based involvements, especially those involving family law problems; and (iii) problematic personal relationships, including relationships with criminals, informers, and persons of ill repute. These conflicts of interest were related to a range of breaches of official police duty, including the misuse of police authority for personal or family benefit, the use of police position to facilitate personal relationships, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential police information. When the conflict of interest identified related specifically to a police officer???s official or public role as a member of the police force, the main types of misconduct identified included three broad areas: (i) the use and abuse of police powers and authority; (ii) the use and abuse of police resources, including information; and (iii) the receipt of gratuities and breaches of the law. These problems were shown to play out in a range of ways, encompassing such behaviours as misuse of the police identity, inappropriate accessing of police information, involvement in investigations where the police officer concerned has a personal interest in the matter, failing to take appropriate police action against friends, family, or associates, the exercise of improper influence in civil matters, and engagement in harassment and discrimination. This study offers some important conceptual developments in relation to the notion of conflict of interest, focusing on the importance of the distinction between a conflict of interest and an associated breach of duty. The study noted that it is often erroneously assumed by police that if there is no breach of duty evidenced, then there is no problem of conflict of interest. The study also offers an important insight into the oversight and accountability processes involved in Victoria Police, emphasising the importance and effectiveness of the oversight role of the office of the Victorian Ombudsman. Evidence also suggests that the internal review processes within Victoria Police are by-and-large stringent, and that senior police management are genuinely interested in making police officers more accountable for their actions. However, it is concluded that both front-line operational police officer and police management often have a limited understanding of conflict of interest, and problems attendant to conflicts of interest. The study???s insights into the problem of conflict of interest are significant insofar as this problem is related to police misconduct???ranging from minor to serious???of various kinds. Attention to the problem of conflict of interest may be an important element in preventing ???upstream??? police misconduct and corruption.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Victoria Police</field><field name="subject">corrupt practices</field><field name="subject">complaints against</field><field name="subject">police misconduct</field><field name="subject">conflict of interests</field><field name="subject">police corruption</field><field name="subject">police power</field><field name="subject">police administration</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Police</field><field name="subject">conflict of interest</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathogenic mechanisms in human carious pulpitis</field><field name="creator">Massey, Ward L.

Two approaches to resource mobilisation that are promoted within Australia are social enterprise and partnering with business. Both of these approaches involve a re-orientation toward business, either in management practices or through an enduring relationship. Despite an increased interest in business-focused resource mobilisation strategies there are few successful examples of social enterprise and partnering with business emerging across the nonprofit sector. There is also scant empirically based research to understand what it takes to adopt these practices, what the consequences of adoption might be and how governments, nonprofits and business stakeholders might support their emergence. This research aims to build an evidence base to provide greater understanding of these issues. The thesis analyses data from fourteen organisational case studies of nonprofit social service organisations located across Australia. Seven of these organisations were selected because they had adopted an enterprising form of resource mobilisation and had been recognised for their achievements in this area. The other seven organisations matched these adopters in terms of mission, location, size and stage of organisational development, though had less diversified resource streams and had not attempted or successfully managed to develop a social enterprise or business partnership. Case-orientated research and qualitative comparative analysis was used in order to achieve causal complexity and a 'configurational' view of the cases (Ragin 1999). The thesis details the conditions that are both necessary and sufficient for business-focused resource mobilisation .processes to be adopted. Organisational capacity and self-efficacy are critical conditions that open up resource innovation possibilities; there is a range of other sufficient conditions that work in combination with these. There are value and ideological challenges to be negotiated by nonprofit social service organisations as they are called upon, both internally and from without, to reinvent the means with which they achieving organisational sustainability. This tension creates the need for new thinking atthe level of policy and practice - across all sectors - in order that these critical organisations that bear responsibility for the social good can successful organise within the contemporary context.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nonprofit organizations.</field><field name="subject">Social service organizations.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/845</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New team identification: Sydney FC, a case study.</field><field name="creator">Lock, Daniel John</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the team identification of fans of a new sport team, using social identity theory. As there is limited research on fans of new sport teams, this study sought to redress this situation by seeking to explain and measure new team identification. Through investigating new team identification, this study extends current applications of social identity theory and understanding of fans of a new sport team. Additionally, by measuring new team identification, this thesis contributes a valid and reliable measure of the construct, and discovery of key themes driving the formation and development of new team identification. A mixed-method research design was used to investigate the central thesis topic. A case study of members of a new sport team, Sydney FC, provided the sample population. The research design included two surveys, administered at the end of the new team&#8217;s first and second seasons, respectively, in addition to twenty-one interviews undertaken to deepen understanding of new team identification. The Sports Spectator Identity Scale (SSIS) was used to measure new team identification and test for differences in identity strength based on participant characteristics. Results indicated that three defining behaviours provided the basis for the formation of new team identification. These were termed: Football first, Origin and Occasion. Measurement of new team identification using the SSIS validated the model in a new team context; however, the value of victory and the identification of rival groupings did not relate strongly to the construct. Member identity strength was significantly influenced by age, salary, membership category and games attended. Five behaviours underpinned the development of new team identification; these were termed: Searching, Expression, Eagerness, Names and Faces, and Spruiking. Social identity theory provided a useful framework to explore the formation and extent of new team identification. The formation of new team identification was strongly influenced by support of football, in this case. The implementation of the SSIS to measure new team identification extended its previous applications. Participant characteristics exerted a clear influence on the strength of new team identification. Members engaged in additional teamrelated behaviours as their new team identification increased and they developed multi-faceted and socially important bonds. Stemming from the key thesis findings, the conceptual outcomes provided a significant contribution to current literature exploring members of new sport teams. Furthermore, the nuanced differences between identification with new and established teams provide a distinct agenda for future research into new sport teams.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Group identity.</field><field name="subject">Sports fans.</field><field name="subject">Sports teams.</field><field name="subject">Sydney Football Club (N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">Soccer.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/848</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable tourism development and rural community values in Australia's forest regions.</field><field name="creator">Schweinsberg, Stephen Conrad</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Personal construct theory.</field><field name="subject">Willingness to pay.</field><field name="subject">Nature tourism.</field><field name="subject">Rural development.</field><field name="subject">Eden (N.S.W.)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planning for sustainable urban water: systems-approaches and distributed strategies.</field><field name="creator">Fane, Simon Anthony</field><field name="description">This thesis develops and applies a number of methods for systems analysis and assessment within the field of sustainable urban water. These focus on the evaluation of distributed strategies. In line with arguments made within the thesis, the methods developed assess urban water on a whole-system basis, with the system defined in terms of the services provided. Further, the thesis argues for sustainable urban water planning to take a pluralist stance; both in the conception of sustainable urban water and the strategies considered. The challenges of sustainability and sustainable development are fundamentally problems of complex systems. Planning and assessment of sustainable urban water therefore require a systems-approach. Systems-thinking is not, however, a unified body of knowledge and this thesis develops a unique perspective on systems-thinking which is used to critically review the fields of sustainable urban water and its assessment. Within these reviews, the thesis develops a framework for understanding sustainable urban water in terms of a number of varied approaches, and describes a feasible theoretical basis for assessing sustainable urban water. Many, so called, sustainable strategies are small-scale and distributed in nature. Distributed strategies include decentralised systems, embedded technologies, and local measures for conservation. Traditional systems analysis methods have failed to account for distributed strategies. To adequately include distributed strategies, this thesis argues that assessment methods will need to be based on whole-system modelling, utilise end-use models of service provision, and include - in the form of a demand forecast - a time dimension in relation to service provision. This thesis proposes new methods for microbial risk assessment on a whole-system basis and Least cost planning for (urban water) Sustainable Scenarios (LeSS). A novel evaluation framework for least cost planning for water supply, which provides an equivalent comparison of demand- and supply-side options, is also developed. These methods are illustrated through case studies. These case studies illustrate the potential of distributed strategies. When assessed on an equivalent basis, in various examples, distributed strategies are shown to be particularly cost effective. Decentralised wastewater reuse systems are also shown to impose a theoretically lower level of pathogen risk on the community than equivalent centralised reuse schemes. Despite the advances in assessment methodologies made within the thesis, further development of practical tools for assessing and planning sustainable urban water remains an urgent goal.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable urban water.</field><field name="subject">Sustainable development.</field><field name="subject">Water reuse.</field><field name="subject">Urban water.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/850</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consuming nirvana: an exploration of surfing tourist space.</field><field name="creator">Ponting, Jess.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this inquiry is to explore the social construction of surfing tourist space in the Mentawai Islands, Indonesia and to expand existing theory to explain the process by which tourist space comes to be overlaid upon the geographical and social domain of destination communities. A review of surfing tourism literature revealed a modest body of knowledge that was largely descriptive, and devoid of any clear theoretical and philosophical perspectives. In order to gain an understanding of the historicity in the production of surfing tourist space, a review of academic and popular surfing literature was undertaken. This review indicated the importance of commercial surf industry discourse, disseminated through a specialist surf media, in defining and maintaining an idealised surfing tourist space (labelled &#8216;Nirvana&#8217;), which is based on the search for, and consumption of, the &#8216;perfect wave&#8217;. A social constructionist interpretation of grounded theory was employed in order to collect and analyse observations and indepth interviews of surfing tourists, surf tour operators, surf industry and media representatives, and locals, from which a number of interpretations were drawn. Firstly, surfing tourist space &#8211; Nirvana - is a fragile and contested space based upon four symbolic elements: perfect waves; uncrowded conditions; cushioned adventure; and, a pristine tropical environment. A four-phase process (referred to as Nirvanification) was developed in order to interpret the way in which tourist space is overlaid upon the social and geographical domain of destinations. It is argued that this space is remotely constructed, highly symbolic, and &#8216;disembedded&#8217; from local realities in the Mentawai Islands. Nirvanification revolves around the construction of symbolic elements of tourist space where it is threatened by alternative discourses, which the industry counters by deploying various myths. The ramification of Nirvanification for local communities in the Mentawais is marginalisation from the economic benefits from tourism. In conclusion this study identified channels for resistance and change which provide an alternative theoretical and philosophical position from which to question the assumptions that underlie socially constructed tourist space.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surfing.</field><field name="subject">Tourism.</field><field name="subject">Mentawai Islands (Indonesia)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/851</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecotrekking: a viable development alternative for the Kokoda track?</field><field name="creator">Grabowski, Simone</field><field name="description">Tourism as an industry in the 20th and 21st Century has primarily been an international money-making industry which has attracted many governments of less developed countries as a fast mechanism for development. This has often involved a trade-off between the pursuit of economic wealth and support for the social, cultural and natural environments. The negative impacts of mass tourism in these economies are countless and well documented, especially as many of these countries are still trying to deal with impacts caused during colonial occupancy. Consequently, alternative tourism has been presented as a way to manage tourism development which is economically, social and ecologically sustainable. One manifestation of this trend is community-based tourism, which aims to be inclusive of the host communities as they plan for tourism and considers the socio cultural and natural resources and desires of tourists in a more equitable manner. The aim of this thesis is to determine how ecotrekking as a form of community-based tourism can provide a foundation for development for remote rural communities in developing countries. It was conceptually determined that if the needs of the community matched those of the tourists, then a sustainable ecotrekking industry can evolve. To explore this issue contextually, a case study of the Kokoda Track (KT) in Papua New Guinea is presented based around three research questions: 1. What role can market segmentation play in sustainable tourism development in remote rural communities? 2. What outcomes do the Kokoda Track communities envisage for the future of tourism on the Kokoda Track? 3. Do Kokoda tourists meet the outcomes envisaged by the community? A review of the literature found that market segmentation is a tool used in destination planning to assess visitor characteristics and match these to resource capabilities. It was employed in this study to determine the characteristics and needs of Kokoda tourists through a questionnaire survey distributed to trekkers via the tour operators. It was found that the Kokoda tourist is a university educated, middle-aged man who visits the KT for adventure and historical reasons. They have higher-order needs of personal development and knowledge and value the authenticity of the experience.  The second research question was approached using secondary data analysis. Notes from Participatory Rural Appraisal workshops with community leaders in 2004 and 2005 were reinterpreted. The key themes to emerge were that the communities have a great need for basic facilities (education, transportation, telecommunications, medical infrastructure and water supplies) and they see tourism as an economic means to develop those facilities. They would like to build more guesthouses and provide food for tourists to increase revenue however, they are unsure of the extent to which this will be supported by trekkers. A comparative analysis of the findings from research questions 1 and 2 was employed to address the third research question. The quantitative needs of the tourist market segment were matched to the qualitative expectations of the communities. It was found that the current Kokoda tourist is in favour of many of the outcomes that the Kokoda communities envisage. These include the provision of locally made food and guesthouses. Further to this, the empirical results from the questionnaire found that ecotourists and cultural tourists are the tourist types that need to be targeted by operators. They indicated a strong match with the desires and needs of the Kokoda communities. For example, they indicated that the KT can cater for a much smaller number of trekkers than the other three pre-determined tourist types (adventure, organised and historic tourists). Additionally, the natural and cultural environments are more important to these tourist types inferring that the protection of these resources is of primary importance. Consequently, it was established that ecotrekking can play an important role in development in less developed countries, if the right market segment is targeted to meet the needs of the community. Generally this can then ensure a slower rate of development, which allows the communities to adjust to the changes that occur at both a socio-cultural level and also in the infrastructure within their communities. In the longer term it also allows them to see how tourism can provide long term benefits not offered in extractive industries such as forestry and mining.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecotrekking.</field><field name="subject">Kokoda Track (Papua New Guinea)</field><field name="subject">Community-based tourism.</field><field name="subject">Market segmentation.</field><field name="subject">Eco-tourism.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution of new media technologies - developing design parameters for a digital media centre for the Beijing Olympic Games 2008.</field><field name="creator">Chau, Mimi</field><field name="description">The advent of digital media has affected the nature of global communications, amplifying the interaction between populations and massively expanding the information load that an audience may be forced to consider.

For the police community in the English-speaking world, police chaplains have emerged as a group of professionals in police organisations providing specialised pastoral care and associated education to their constituents. As a relatively new community of practitioners, little is known about the emergence of this group in terms of its needs for learning, education and support and processes of acquisition of knowledge and skills. Major purposes of this study were to explicate the learning engaged in by police chaplains to become a professional practitioner and to project the role for future sustainability for all stakeholders. This is the first doctoral thesis to examine the development and practice of police chaplaincy in New South Wales (Australia), New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It was argued that neither police chaplains themselves nor the police communities they serve understand the potential of the role and implications for future learning and performance of that role. Prior to this study, there were no strategies in place to assess consequences of change, to address work-related problems or to determine future training. Consequently, this study explored how police chaplains perform their role so they could better justify the value of their roles for multiple stakeholders and make suitable professional development plans and strategies to improve services, address work-related problems adequately and respond appropriately to social changes. In order to understand and articulate the experiences of police chaplains, a reflective analysis was provided of the work of practising police chaplains in New South Wales, Australia, and a comparative study of police chaplains in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The qualitative research design was interpretive and used ethnography and autoethnography as methodologies. The researcher is a police chaplain herself and is a current member of this professional group in New South Wales and was for a period of time in New Zealand. Four key objectives guided the inquiry and were addressed in determining an explanatory framework in the literature review and in the findings and discussion chapters. The first objective was to investigate the nature of the professional police chaplain. The findings suggested that police chaplains were male or female, ordained or lay, highly educated and pastoral and have a passion for policing. They are professional in nature from their qualifications as a minister, practising professionalism in their role as minister and chaplain and behaving appropriately as a professional. It was discovered in this study that because police chaplains largely act alone they have developed four distinct &#8216;walking styles&#8217; of having a presence and performing their role in a police station or other venues. The second objective to explicate the nature of police chaplaincy culture focused on kinship among police chaplains and incorporated notions of community of practice, culture and identity. The findings showed that kinship was a useful explanatory concept for analysing the culture of police chaplaincy. It became evident in the study that learning, belonging, connecting, participating and knowing were essential in the police chaplain&#8217;s role in complex and diverse communities of practice and various community and organisational cultures that influenced their identities as a minister, chaplain and pastoral carer. The third objective was to identify the major challenges faced by police chaplains. The findings indicated that police chaplains consistently faced challenges in representing the spiritual to police, managing their time, finding best practices, being credible and understanding others relationally as well as attending critical incidents in their ongoing honorary position. Senior Chaplains played an important role providing the support and training that police chaplains require for their ongoing practice while mentors and/or spouses also provided necessary time to listen to the police chaplain&#8217;s challenging day. The fourth objective was to examine the professional development and training of police chaplains. The findings revealed that training offered to the honorary police chaplain was minimal and did not meet the police chaplains&#8217; needs. Strategies including a program of continuing professional education have been suggested to enhance training and development for the future of police chaplaincy. Police chaplains interviewed for this research have given a broad range of perspectives making this exploratory study a significant contribution towards capturing the culture of police chaplaincy for the first time. This exposition of the work of police chaplains contributes to setting future directions for police chaplaincy practice and research enabling a better service for police officers and staff of police services worldwide.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Police chaplain.</field><field name="subject">Pastoral care.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/854</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrode performance and signal processing strategies for the discrimination of EEG alpha waves: implications for environmental control by unconstrained subjects without training.</field><field name="creator">Searle, Andrew.</field><field name="description">The phenomenon of the increase in alpha EEG activity associated with eye closure has been shown to be successful for implementing environmental control for disabled persons. Studies in this thesis investigate strategies which improve the reliability, robustness, and ease of use of alpha EEG control systems. Primarily, research covers the effectiveness of alpha EEG detection algorithms (with regard to detection time and susceptibility to artifact) and the construction and use of EEG sensing electrodes. Many new techniques for the detection of the increase of alpha EEG associated with eye closure are researched, developed, implemented and evaluated. All detection techniques are compared to a conventional method using a novel performance parameterisation criterion. In conjunction with the application of the same EEG data sets to all techniques, the use of the performance criteria enables a fair and quantitative comparison to be made between alpha detection methodologies. Detection techniques employed include enhanced versions of conventional methods, localisation of apparent alpha sources in the brain, and preprocessing methods (such as spatial filtering, adaptive filtering and independent component analysis). The best performance of alpha EEG detection was given by the source power alpha localisation technique, which showed statistically significant and practically important improvements in performance over conventional techniques. Additionally, this localisation technique is convenient and fast to implement. In situations in which electrodes are intended for unsupervised use with environmental control systems, the evaluation of alternative electrode types to the conventional wet electrodes is required, as the use of wet electrodes has several drawbacks. The performance of wet, dry and insulating electrodes is compared in this research. One aspect of the quantitative comparison of electrodes types is the measurement of contact impedance. To enable the fast and accurate measurement of impedance spectra, a new impedance spectroscopy system was developed as part of this thesis. In addition to comparison of impedance criteria, electrodes were evaluated in the presence movement-based, and electric field induced, artifacts. The electrode comparisons were carried out in a direct and quantitative manner in a controlled test environment for the first time. Results indicate that, in contrast to earlier reports, both dry and insulating electrode perform well with respect to artifact and offer a viable alternative to wet electrodes for long-term monitoring of biosignals from the surface of the skin. More improvements are required before such electrodes are suitable for EEG usage.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electroencephalography.</field><field name="subject">EEG alpha waves.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination into the effects of incorporating collaborative learning methods in a core first-year mathematics subject.</field><field name="creator">D'Souza, Sabita Maria.</field><field name="description">This project aims to examine the effects of incorporating collaborative learning methods extensively in a core first-year mathematics subject and to investigate students' individual learning style preferences, their attitudes towards group-work in mathematics and the objectives for setting group work, their attitudes towards using computers, in particular, Mathematica and their concerns regarding the assessment of group-based work. Following the rapid increase in the use of technology in education over the last decade, one would perhaps expect to find an overabundance of literature regarding the effects of its use. However, the number of technology related research studies has been surprisingly low, especially those pertaining to the curriculum area of Mathematics at the tertiary level. The availability of quality software, the need for curriculum redesign, and limited research on the effectiveness of computers as a teaching tool, are factors to have hindered the rate of implementation and of subsequent research. Also, despite the rapid growth in the use of collaborative methods of learning, and widespread belief in the importance of such methods, there have been calls for increased research especially at the tertiary level, and particularly in engineering education looking at students who have to study mathematics because it is a requirement and not because they are majoring in mathematics, therefore needing to determine how best to make their learning a meaningful and enjoyable experience. This project aims to investigative the effects of incorporating a rich collaborative learning based curriculum in either face-to-face or computer-supported environments in the subject Mathematical Modelling 1. The carrying out of this project is a response to the lack of research in a curriculum area of tertiary mathematics. Within the context of mathematics, issues of attitude, gender differences, motivation and achievement are considered. The chief purpose of this investigation is to explore the effectiveness of collaborative learning in mathematics at university, and to provide some insight as to what degree, if any, the use of such methods enhance mathematics learning. The research uses an experimental methodology, an attitudinal questionnaire and indepth interviews to elicit students' feelings and/or opinions toward the incorporation of collaborative learning. The questionnaire sought demographic information from the students, namely, name, age, gender, length of stay in Australia and language spoken at home, and investigates the role of these factors in the effectiveness of, and interest during the tutorial and laboratory sessions a time when students were working on collaborative-based activities. This project maintains interest in the use of collaborative problem solving, and the belief that the findings could be of international significance if the effectiveness of this style of learning can be finnly established. It is also hoped that grounding the collaborative activities in the literature, and providing statistical and theoretical support for their use might promote them more widely in mathematics in particular and more generally, across universities in Australia. The broad issue of whether the use of collaborative learning enhances mathematics learning can be broken down into a number of specific inquiries. The key research questions may thus be expressed as follows: I. What are tertiary students' preferred learning styles? 2. What are students' opinions about group work in mathematics? 3. Does collaborative group work foster a deep, meaningful understanding of mathematics? 4. What are students' attitudes about using CAS such as Mathematica? 5. What are students' attitudes about the assessment of group-based work? 6. Are there any differences in students' learning style preferences across the various demographics? 7. Are there any differences in students' attitudes towards collaborative learning methods across the various demographics? 8. Are there any differences in students' attitudes towards the use of Mathematica across the various demographics? 9. Are there any variations in students' attitudes towards the assessment of group work in mathematics across the various demographics? This study does not claim to fill the void into the effectiveness of computers or collaborative learning methods, but should provide greater insight and support to future research.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Collaborative learning.</field><field name="subject">Group-work.</field><field name="subject">Mathematica (Computer file)</field><field name="subject">Mathematics.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stress and the immune network</field><field name="creator">Degabriele, Robert</field><field name="description">The clonal selection/defence paradigm appears unable to reconcile immune function with homeostatic activity whereas organismic homeostasis is central to immune function in the network/autopoiesis paradigm. The aim of this investigation, therefore, was to test the proposition that immune function, that is not clonally driven (central immune system activity), contributes to organismic homeostasis in collaboration with psychoneural responses. In one experiment sheep were confined, either in groups or individually, and the time course of changes in cortisol levels, behaviour and T lymphocyte numbers were monitored. In another study, soldiers were monitored during the stressful experience of recruit training. The combined results suggest that, at least when the immune response is not clonally driven, the psychoneural system and the central immune system may not be operating independently of each other but rather as sub-networks of the organismic network. Consequently, homeostasis is properly characterised as a property of the whole organism.

The models have been developed out of concerns about declining enrolments and continued sex differences in enrolments in these courses. They use the framework of the Science enrolment Model (SEM), a framework which uses an expectancy/value approach to examine the relationships between the various influences and their combined effect on enrolment behaviour. The SEM was constructed by fitting the factors which have been shown to influence enrolment behaviour in the sciences to the structure of the General Model of Academic Choice, a model of achievement related behaviour developed by Eccles and colleagues. Models were constructed for enrolment behaviour in three specialist science courses; Biology, Chemistry and Physics and two non-specialist science courses; General Science and Science for Life. These five courses account for 97 percent of enrolments in senior secondary science in New South Wales. Measures of enrolment intentions were predicted by, measures of interest, perceived career value, TER value (value as a means gaining university entrance) and a combined measure of self-concept and performance expectations. These constructs were, in turn, predicted by measures of perceptions of parent and teacher attitudes, perceptions of past performance, attributions for past performance and personality measures. The enrolment models explained between 60% and 70% of the variance in enrolment intentions in the specialist science subjects. 'Career value' was found to be a major influence on enrolment behaviour in all five subjects. The expectancy and value variables explained approximately 80 percent of the sex difference in enrolment intentions in the specialist science subjects.

The nature of the metcognitive guidance was analysed with respect to task initiation, task regulation, metcognitive guidance, strategic assistance, speech styles, and forms of sustaining the child&#8217;s mindfulness. The results generally supported the notions of cultural universality and specificity in maternal metcognitive guidance. While similarities were noted in mothers&#8217; collaboration, supportive intent and verbal strategic guidance, differences were revealed in task initiation, linguistic mediation, non-verbal strategic guidance and metacognitive modeling. The findings on metcognitive guidance as a function of gender of the child indicated similarities, suggesting that differential guidance of male and female children&#8217;s metacognitive learning may be less pronounced in the preschool years compared with later childhood years. Indian mothers guided and supported their male children&#8217;s metcognitive/strategic learning more frequently than did Australian mothers.

Accordingly, it is proposed that an understanding of the realities constructed by teachers involved in inclusive practice provides imperatives for future action. In particular, this study explores the finer structures of changed pedagogy, professional development of teachers and the vision of quality education for all that underpin the fabric of inclusive schooling. Furthermore, the study suggests that the focus on teachers&#8217; own accounts or voice provides a major resource with which to theorise and analyse the actuality of inclusive practice and to help overcome barriers to success. In examining the work realities of teachers involved in inclusive education this thesis reports on the results of an empirically grounded and theoretically informed enquiry of the major educational reform of including students with disabilities into regular classroom settings. The case study site for this investigation included two schools, within the State of Victoria, Australia. Primary evidence generated through this study suggests that teachers&#8217; work is a vital contributing factor to successful inclusion, despite the overpowering emphasis on additional funding within the political construction of policy implementation. However, teachers&#8217; existing professional expertise and their professional development needs have not been a key focus of policies directed at sustaining the changed political culture required by inclusion. Drawing on relevant research literature and research evidence, this study argues against the political reductionism of both liberal pluralism and systems theory approaches that have dominated State policy action in inclusive education. In contrast the evidence presented in this thesis suggests the need to reconsider and revalue the knowledge and expertise generated by the education policy actors in this field, namely classroom teachers and school administrators involved in institutional planning and practice. It is these knowledgeable education workers who really influence policy implementation. The significance of this research is that the &#8216;insiders&#8217; are presented as potentially important drivers shaping the mechanisms for educational reform. For this reason the framework of this study centres on the communicative infrastructures within existing institutions (schools) and the policy actors (teachers) who come together to formulate issues and professional directions. Therefore, the review of the research literature sets out to identify key theories and evidence pertaining to the teachers&#8217; knowledge and learning communities. Literature on the importance of individual and collective agency is reviewed and situated in terms of the debates over the communicative action and life worlds of teachers at the sites of inclusive education reform. In turn, this provides a pathway for establishing the secondary evidence concerning what is currently known about the life worlds of teachers where change engages with struggles over ideological totality, elitist political agendas and the actualities of educational reform. Transcending critical and interpretive paradigms of educational research, capturing teachers&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; voice on the complexities of inclusive education, the study moves beyond critical analysis of the way policies construct, or fail to construct, institutions and individuals within them. Inclusion is viewed through the life worlds of teachers involved in integration and inclusive programs, and situated within the context of their communicative actions. Data was generated through unstructured interviews where there was an emphasis on informal contexts and open communication that was free from system distortion. Communicative interaction was then expanded through a second semi-structured interview for the purpose of validation of the data and for testing the researcher&#8217;s construction of received messages. In addition feedback regarding emergent themes and representative quotes was also requested from participants. In this study the situated meaning of teachers&#8217; work as an expression of policy-in practice was explored in relation to the textual framing created by State policy, institutions (schools) and teachers&#8217; own skills and knowledge. The major perceptual elements for this research focus on the interrelation between these policy contexts, the paradigm that frames teacher&#8217;s professional knowledge and the pathways and processes for teaching and learning to occur.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">inclusive education</field><field name="subject">students with disabilities</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/37127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing the use of professional craft knowledge in process drama teaching</field><field name="creator">Simons, Jennifer</field><field name="description">The research articles in this portfolio describe and analyse how process drama teachers use the special combination of content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and knowledge gained in 'lifeworld' experiences (described in this portfolio as their 'professional craft knowledge') in order to promote learning.

The methodology is primarily reflective practitioner research, recently described as one of drama's 'own innovative recommended research designs'. Qualitative methods have been used to collect and analyse relevant data. Separate sources of data are used to check the trustworthiness of the findings, through the process of crystallization : the alignment of sources such as reflective journals, outside observations, video records and oral reflections. Professional craft knowledge is developed by individual teachers as they reflect in action on the choices they see as available to them, as they work with their own classes. Often teachers are not conscious of the expertise they are developing; it quickly becomes tacit, embodied knowledge. However, reflecting upon their actions, teachers can usually explain why they acted as they did. The research articles in this Portfolio make use of reflection in and upon action in order to deconstruct the work of process drama teaching. As a collection these articles also examine how the use of reflective practices in pre-service education can facilitate and enhance the development of craft knowledge before teachers enter the professio</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">process drama</field><field name="subject">professional craft knowledge</field><field name="subject">playbuilding</field><field name="subject">creativity</field><field name="subject">oleplay</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Quest for Indonesian Islam:
Contestation and Consensus Concerning Veiling</field><field name="creator">Hamdani, Deny</field><field name="description">This study examines various transformations in the practice of veiling which have involved changes in its meaning for Indonesian Muslims.  It concentrates on a forty-year period from the New Order to the Reform Era.  In particular, it focuses on the interplay between the practice of wearing the veil and the changing social and political constellation in Indonesia, and relates these to the presence of both contestation and consensus regarding veiling among Indonesian Muslims.  
After conducting one year&#146;s fieldwork in some regions of Indonesia, I found significant changes in how Muslims negotiate their daily lives in connection with the idea of veiling.  While a &#145;relaxed&#146; form of veiling has long been practiced by santri (devout) Muslims, veiling has assumed an absolute meaning for other Muslims, especially since the increasing Islamisation of various social classes.  The practice of veiling has become pervasive among Muslims: at the same time, it is intertwined with fashion trends, commercialisation and the expression of personal and religious identity.&#182;
Although some Modernist Muslims continue to contest the Islamist discourse regarding veiling, there is a growing trend to make veiling mandatory in certain parts of Indonesia.  Veiling became oppressive rather than liberating in the areas where it has been imposed in the public domain.  The appearance of the veil also changed: from a modest and traditional practice (kerudung), it was turned into the mandatory jilbab, which covers the head, neck and chest much more strictly.  The veil transformed again in some parts of Indonesia, to become a fashion item: this made it a promising product for industry and marketing, due to the growing number of Muslim consumers.  At the same time, in some places it has continued to be imposed by local Islam-oriented regimes which tend to want to control public behaviour according to their interpretation.  In the light of these changes, I argue that the changing social and political conditions in contemporary Indonesia have impelled Muslims to search for an &#147;Indonesian Islam&#148;: what form that indigenous version of Islam will take is still being negotiated.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">veiling</field><field name="subject">Indonesian Islam</field><field name="subject">Islamic attire</field><field name="subject">Islam-oriented regime.</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090714.023401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A minimalist sui generis legislative proposal for the application of common law principles to the protection of computer software</field><field name="creator">Forsyth, Guy</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the development of copyright and patent protection in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia and proposes that intellectual property is not the correct mechanism for protecting computer software. Both copyright and patent protection are evaluated in relation to their application to protecting the various elements of software.
The increased desire for patent protection of software in the United States has recently impacted the debate over the correct regime for intellectual property protection. There has also been a corresponding restriction in the application of copyright protection by the courts. Combined with an undercurrent of sui generis software legislation being advocated by academia this has lead to the situation where there is continuing uncertainty over which method of protection should be provided for software.
It will be shown that copyright is inadequate for the protection of computer software and that it does not address the correct element requiring protection. Patents, by corollary, provide protection that is excessive. The socio-economic effects of patent protection will be shown to demonstrate that it is not a worthy successor or adjunct to copyright. While copyright has attempted to protect one aspect (source code) patents have attempted to protect another (functionality). The thesis identifies the fundamental flaws in the protection offered by both regimes and proposes that they are equally unsuitable for the protection of software.
Software will be shown to possess a diverse array of elements that are largely indivisible if adequate protection is to be provided. It is proposed that software be considered as a new form of property, referred to as Binary property, which covers informational and information processing entities. Further, the existing common law principles should be applied to the aspects that are at the heart of the intellectual property protection dilemma. In reality the elements requiring protection in software are activities that wrongfully duplicate a work or replicate it to create clones. It will be shown that the common law principles of theft, trespass, breach of contract and passing-off are suitable for protecting developers from these infringements. It will also be contended that any legislative intervention should be limited so that a certain degree of replication is allowable where there is a benefit to society through technological
advancement or enhancement through standardisation. As such the application of common law principles are applied in a minimalist legalistic environment.
The minimalist approach takes the position that there should be minimal legislative intervention in the computer industry. It proposes that there should be legislative intervention to enable the existing common law to take account of computer technology and provide for its continuing impact on society that will accelerate into the next millennium. It further shows that the continuing development of computer technology will outpace intellectual property necessitating the recognition of computer software as a unique form of new property in existing jurisprudence. The application of existing common law principles of property and the reduction in the monopolistic nature of intellectual property will not only benefit the highly dynamic and creative international computer industry but it will also be in the best interests of the Australian software development industry.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">United Kingdom</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">copyright</field><field name="subject">patent law</field><field name="subject">intellectual property</field><field name="subject">computer software.</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20090714.142532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Socioeconomic attainments and birthplace variations in Australia</field><field name="creator">Adhikari, Pramod Kumar, Politics, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Australia is home for immigrants from more than a hundred countries and in total almost a quarter of all Australians are overseas-born. A high proportion of immigrants in a society raises question about socioeconomic equality. The purpose of the thesis is to study the differences in socioeconomic attainments between immigrants and native-born workers.	Using data collected from the Issues in Multicultural Australia Survey, conducted in 1988, and the ABS Census of Population and Housing, 1986 and 1991, the study finds that human capital variables such as education, language proficiency and experience largely explain the socioeconomic attainments of Australian-born workers. Among immigrant workers, however, these human capital variables have little or no effect on status attainments. The data also show that the lower socioeconomic status of immigrants may not be due only to the lower investment in human capital. Even second generation NESB immigrants are unable to obtain comparable rewards compared to longer established Australians with similar education and skills. The study indicates that there may be barriers in the Australian labour market operating against NESB immigrants.	The study concludes that there are birthplace variations in workers??? socioeconomic attainments. When employers can hire Australian-born workers from a large pool of unemployed workers, immigrant workers will be excluded from employment. Immigrant workers will only be hired if the rewards for these workers are lower compared to Australian-born workers. In situations of high unemployment, especially, immigrant workers will find it difficult to be treated equally in the labour market.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian immigration</field><field name="subject">discrimination</field><field name="subject">earnings</field><field name="subject">employment</field><field name="subject">equality</field><field name="subject">immigrant workers</field><field name="subject">immigrants</field><field name="subject">immigration</field><field name="subject">human capital</field><field name="subject">labour force</field><field name="subject">labour market</field><field name="subject">migrant enclaves</field><field name="subject">migrants</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">non-English speaking background</field><field name="subject">NESB</field><field name="subject">socioeconomic attainments</field><field name="subject">status</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Private lives : the presentation of marriage in English drama 1930-1990</field><field name="creator">Burns, Glenn, English, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite the broadening of the subject matter of English drama in its ???new wave??? period from the late nineteen fifties, it is striking to see how much of enduring mainstream English drama has a domestic focus. The purpose of this thesis is to provide the first full-length study of marriage on the English stage from 1930-1990.  The thesis examines the way in which a number of important playwrights have fashioned drama from the conflict between the public, or institutional, functions of marriage and the private, or relational, functions of marriage. The thesis places this conflict into historical context. This will show that the conflict between the private and public aspects of marriage is not one of clearly opposed opposites but one that is made dynamic by significant social and legal changes to the status, function and conventions of marriage. The thesis also demonstrates that this conflict is further complicated by class considerations and by the particular circumstances of each marital partnership.  From the wealth of material available, I have chosen to examine in detail the work of seven playwrights who have made significant contributions to domestic drama or domestic comedy. Playwrights have been selected because their plays gained a strong audience on first performance and because, through numerous revivals and through publication of scripts, they have earned an enduring place in English drama. John Osborne???s Look Back in Anger, which in 1956, ushered in the ???new wave???, is pivotal play for discussion. The previous generation is represented by Noel Coward, J. B. Priestley and Terence Rattigan. The ???new wave??? and its aftermath are represented by Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard and, finally Alan Ayckbourn. Despite a wide variety of approaches to the topic of marriage, these writers tend to assume a middle class audience and to follow or adapt the traditions of realism or comedy of manners.  This thesis argues that despite real, even radical, changes to marriage, to accepted sexual practices and to the status of women in the sixty years under discussion, the mainstream theatre has tended to be conservative in its presentation of marital and sexual matters, especially in continuing to reinscribe a public/private opposition determined by gender.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public marriage</field><field name="subject">private  marriage</field><field name="subject">patriarchal marriage</field><field name="subject">Noel Coward</field><field name="subject">J.B.

From mock jury surveys relating to DNA profiling evidence, it was determined that most respondents were able to comprehend some basic and applied statistics, although their ability was in part related to their knowledge of English and their level of education. The point at which mock jurors were prepared to convict an accused solely on the basis of DNA profiling evidence was examined and found to be low compared with the strength of DNA profiling evidence commonly presented in Australian courts. Mock jurors also demonstrated the ability to process evidence that was presented in a Bayesian framework; commencing with prior odds, introducing new information and culminating in posterior odds.  From a survey of Australian forensic scientists, including fraud investigators, it was found that most practitioners' concerns could be addressed by greater pre-trial consultation between experts and legal advocates. Improved knowledge within the legal profession concerning the jargon, principles, procedures, limitations and conclusions to be drawn from different scientific disciplines, prior to presenting this evidence in court, is recommended as the means by which complex evidence can be better adduced from expert witnesses and better presented to juries in criminal trials.  Finally, from interviewing actual jurors in criminal trials in the Australian Capital Territory it was determined that where jurors' expectations of scientific evidence, particularly DNA profiling evidence, are not met, high levels of juror frustration and speculation may culminate in hung juries. The adversarial setting of criminal proceedings was also found to produce an environment in which jurors felt that information that would assist them in reaching a verdict was being deliberately withheld. The ability of the jury to ask questions and the allowed nature of those questions were also examined, with the resultant recommendation that juries be given more explicit information at the commencement of trials to inform them about their rights and obligations when asking questions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA fingerprinting</field><field name="subject">DNA profiling</field><field name="subject">jury duty</field><field name="subject">jurors</field><field name="subject">juries</field><field name="subject">criminal investigation</field><field name="subject">forensic genetics</field><field name="subject">evidence</field><field name="subject">Australian forensic scientists</field><field name="subject">expert evidence</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laboratory characterisation of cementitiously stabilised pavement materials</field><field name="creator">White, Gregory William, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Insitu cementitious stabilisation is an economical, environmentally sustainable and socially advantageous means of rehabilitating pavements. With the recent availability of a wide range of binders and advanced construction equipment, the characterisation of cementitiously stabilised pavement materials has become the focus of further advancement of this technology. Australian practice has moved towards the use of Indirect Diametric Tensile (IDT) methods for the characterisation of these materials. A draft protocol for the IDT test has been prepared and specifies samples to be compacted by gyratory compactor. This procedure provides for both monotonic and repeated load testing, which aims to measure the material???s strength, modulus and fatigue life. A range of host materials, including a new crushed rock and a reclaimed existing pavement base course, were assessed when stabilised with a General Purpose cement binder as well as with a slag-lime blended binder. Materials were assess for their inherent material properties, Unconfined Compression Strength (UCS), Unconfined Compression modulus, IDT strength and modulus under both monotonic and repeated load. A number of amendments and refinements to the testing protocol were recommended. These included the use of minimum binder contents to ensure the binder was uniformly distributed and to promote heavy binding of the materials to ensure they behaved elastically. It was also recommended that samples be gyratory compacted to a pre-determined sample height to allow a constant density to be achieved. The variability of the test results was examined. UCS results were found to be comparatively as variable as other researchers had reported. IDT strength results contained a similar level of variability, which was considered to be acceptable. Modulus results, both monotonic and repeated load, were found to be five to ten times more variable than strength results, which is a generally accepted trend for modulus testing. Under repeated loading, some challenges with the test protocol were encountered. The primary challenge was obtaining reliable and repeatable diametrical displacement data for modulus calculation. This was partially overcome by the insertion of smooth spacers to prevent the Linear Voltage Displacement Transformer (LVDTs) becoming caught on the sample sides. The achievement of reliable and repeatable IDT modulus results through improved displacement measurements should be the focus of future research efforts in this area.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cementitious stabilised pavement materials</field><field name="subject">monotonic strength</field><field name="subject">density</field><field name="subject">compaction</field><field name="subject">loading</field><field name="subject">maintenance and repair</field><field name="subject">cement composites</field><field name="subject">testing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supramolecular chemistry and synthesis of Cucurbit[n]uril</field><field name="creator">White, Tim, Chemistry, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The recently discovered cucurbit[n]uril are a range of macrocyclic hosts which have enormous potential in industrial, medical and academic applications.  Cucurbit[n]uril have a rigid repeating structure of methylene bridged glycouril, which give cucurbit[n]uril their gourd like shape of  a cavity with two carbonyl fringed portals.  In this thesis the host-guest binding abilities of three cucurbit[n]uril (n = 6, 7, 8) have been examined for a range of potential guests.  These guests ranged from simple alkyl amines through globular alkyl and carboranyl amines to bipyridyl systems.  In total 45 guest molecules where examined. Most of the guests examined where either cationically charged, capable of hydrogen binding, contained a substantial molecular dipole, or a combination of these.  Furthermore, all of the potential guests examined had some solubility in an acidified aqueous sodium sulfate solution within which the host-guest properties were examined.  It was generally found that the larger guests did have selectivity for the larger hosts.  However, when the host became too large weaker complexes would form and for the range of materials examined here cucurbit[7]uril was found to be the 'best' host system.  In one example, p-xylene diamine, a 2:1 complex with cucurbit[8]uril was observed.  While not the focus of this work a new rapid purification method was developed for the cucurbit[n]uril using different metal ions to either solubilise or precipitate the different cucurbit[n]uril.  In the second part of this work these same guest molecules where used as potential templates in the synthesis of cucurbit[n]uril.  Surprisingly the guests that bound strongly to an individual host did not seem to template the cucurbit[n]uril synthesis at all.  Rather these strong binders inhibited the reaction such that little or no cucurbit[n]uril formed under the reaction conditions studied.  However, several examples provided excellent template results.  Indeed the results indicate that guests which bound with intermediate rates of exchange are the best templates and using templates under these conditions we have been able to produce cucurbit[7]uril as 46% by mass of the total cucurbit[n]uril product.  This is the highest yield ever recorded for cucurbit[7]uril and it is the first example of cucurbit[7]uril being the major product of this condensation reaction.  In an another example cucurbit[8]uril formed 18% of the product an increase of 150% over the standard reaction conditions.  While studying both the template reactions and the host-guest binding properties of the cucurbit[n]uril a new supramolecular form, an 'inverse rotaxane' was discovered.  Inverse rotaxanes are not held in place by large blocking groups, rather the molecular structure encapsulated by the cucurbit[n]uril host prevents decomplexation of the axle.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cucurbituril</field><field name="subject">cucurbit[n]uril</field><field name="subject">macrocyclic hosts</field><field name="subject">methylene bridged glycouril</field><field name="subject">inverse rotaxanes</field><field name="subject">supramolecular chemistry</field><field name="subject">synthesis</field><field name="subject">templates</field><field name="subject">host-guest binding</field><field name="subject">guest molecules</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Provision of environmental goods on private land: a case study of Australian wetlands</field><field name="creator">Whitten, Stuart Max, Business, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The management of natural resources located on private lands often involves a perceived conflict between the mix of private and public benefit outputs they produce. Governments have tended to respond through legislation to restrict and redirect private decisions about resource management. However, the legislative response faces a lack of information about the costs and benefits of alternative management and policy instruments. A pertinent example of this debate is the management of wetlands on private lands.  The goal in this thesis is to advance the design of policy relating to the production of environmental outputs on private lands. This goal is achieved by first estimating the welfare impacts of alternative private land management strategies on the wider community. These estimates are used as inputs into the development of alternative policy instruments that are then evaluated in terms of their potential cost-effectiveness in influencing private management. Two case studies of wetland management on private land in Australia are presented ??? the Upper South East Region of South Australia, and, the Murrumbidgee River Floodplain in New South Wales.  The conceptual approach described in the first part of the thesis includes a description of the resource management problem and the strengths and weaknesses of the alternative decision frameworks widely employed in Australia. Identification of the cause and nature of transaction costs in the management process is the focus in this discussion.  The welfare impacts of alternative wetland management strategies are investigated through the construction of a bio-economic model for each of the case study areas. The approach integrates biophysical analysis of changing wetland management with the value society places on wetlands. Outputs from this process are used in the development of a range of policy instruments directed towards influencing wetland management. The impact of poorly quantified and uncertain transaction costs on the potential cost-effectiveness of these options is evaluated using threshold policy analysis.  The empirical results show that the perception of a conflict between the private and public values generated by resource management is accurate. For example, scenarios changing wetland management in the Upper South East of South Australia on the Murrumbidgee River floodplain in New South Wales were shown to generate net benefits of $5.2m and $5.1m respectively. Hence, changing wetland management could generate increased community welfare. The potential for these findings to be translated into wetland policy is less conclusive. Policies directed towards wetland management (in part or in whole) incur a range of transaction costs and deliver differential wetland protection benefits. Ten ???best bet??? policies are identified, but more information is required to determine conclusively whether a net benefit results to the wider community when transaction costs are included.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transaction costs</field><field name="subject">benefit-cost analysis</field><field name="subject">wetlands</field><field name="subject">public goods</field><field name="subject">environmental economics</field><field name="subject">institutional economics</field><field name="subject">bio-economic modelling</field><field name="subject">policy selection</field><field name="subject">choice modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38661</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The eagle and the albatross : Australian aerial maritime operations 1921-1971</field><field name="creator">Wilson, David Joseph, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to examine the relationship between the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) regarding the operation of aircraft from ships of the RAN and from RAAF shore bases. The effects of the separate intellectual development of maritime doctrine in the RAAF and RAN, and the efforts of the two Australian services to transfer theory into practice will be considered in the pre- (and post) World War II period, with due consideration of the experience of the services in both wars. The thesis will also discuss the problems that were faced by the RAAF and RAN to develop mutually acceptable operational procedures to enable the efficient use of aircraft in a maritime setting. The influence and effect on RAAF and RAN doctrine and equipment procurement, as a result of the special relationships that developed between the Air Force and Navy of Australia and Britain will be critically examined. A similar approach to the post war US/Australian relationship, and its effect on the Australian services, will also be critically examined. The thesis being propounded is that the development of a unique Australian maritime policy was retarded due to a combination of the relationship with Britain and the United States, lack of suitable equipment, lack of clear operational concepts in both the RAAF and RAN and the parochial attitude of the most senior commanders of both Services. 	The study has been based on Department of Navy, Department of Air and Department of Defence documents held in the National Archives of Australia in Canberra and Melbourne. In addition, relevant documents from the Admiralty and Air Ministry related to the development of naval aviation on RAN vessels during World War I, the attitude of the RAF toward the deployment of RAAF units to Singapore, and the negotiations that resulted in the procurement of HMA Ships Sydney and Melbourne, have been perused. Wartime operational records of the RAAF have been examined to obtain data to enable a critical study to be made of the RAAF anti-submarine campaign, torpedo bomber operations and the maritime campaign undertaken from bases in North Western Area during World War II. The influence of the commander of the United States 5th Air Force has also been incorporated in the discussion. The research uncovered procedural and operational variations between the two Services, the diversion of key elements from Australian command and the priority given to the American line of advance that resulted in Australian operations being given a secondary, supportive, status.	A conclusion reached as a result of this research has been that the development of a unique Australian maritime aerial capability was restricted by the requirement of Britain to deploy flying units to Singapore in 1940. Similarly, the pressure exerted on the RAN by the Admiralty to purchase the Light Fleet Carriers in the late 1940s was more in the interests of the RN and British foreign policy than that of the RAN. Overall, the relationship with the Britain and the United States masked the real weakness in Australia???s maritime operations and retarded its development.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerial maritime asset</field><field name="subject">aerial maritime operations</field><field name="subject">aerial maritime theory</field><field name="subject">aircraft</field><field name="subject">air power doctrine</field><field name="subject">anti-submarine operations</field><field name="subject">Australian maritime defence</field><field name="subject">Australian maritime policy</field><field name="subject">Australian naval aviation</field><field name="subject">Britain</field><field name="subject">British Far East policy</field><field name="subject">cold war effect on aerial maritime policy</field><field name="subject">Empire defence</field><field name="subject">equipment procurement</field><field name="subject">land based marine operations</field><field name="subject">maritime air power</field><field name="subject">maritime aerial operations</field><field name="subject">maritime doctrine</field><field name="subject">RAAF</field><field name="subject">RAN</field><field name="subject">Royal Australian Air Force</field><field name="subject">Royal Australian Navy</field><field name="subject">Royal Navy Aviation policy</field><field name="subject">torpedo bomber squadrons</field><field name="subject">torpedo bomber strike</field><field name="subject">United States Naval Aviation</field><field name="subject">United Kingdom</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian Defence in transition: responding to new security challenges</field><field name="creator">Wing, Ian, Politics, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The conceptual understanding of security and the practicalities of national defence are interdependent.  In many countries both are undergoing significant change.  This work provides an international context but focuses on Australian defence, arguing that a transition is underway from old security thinking to new, and that this is evidenced by changes in policies and practical activities.  The aim of this work is to demonstrate the interdependence between the current reconceptualisation of security and the practicalities of national defence.  Old security thinking concerns military power relationships between states, in contrast with new security thinking, which uses a broader conceptual framework.  These are described, providing benchmarks for the subsequent analysis.  While it is acknowledged that change has occurred in security thinking throughout history, those developments observed since the end of the Cold War and the rise of globalisation signify a fundamental shift.    To explore this shift, recent developments in the defence policies and military activities of four relevant nations are examined, providing an international context for the consideration of the primary case study of Australian defence.  This case study draws on historical descriptions and empirical data to analyse developments in four spheres - Australian defence policy, current Australian Defence Force activities, recent military developments and contemporary Australian public debate.  The weight of evidence supports the thesis of a transition in both security thinking, described as transitional security thinking, and ADF activities.   Tensions are observed between the requirements of defending a nation against attack, and contributing to the expanding requirements of the broadened security agenda.    Despite these tensions, the expansion in both security thinking and the associated activities of armed forces, is likely to continue. This expansion has important implications for Australia???s defence capabilities which are increasingly required to meet the demands of refocused national security.  These demands contribute to the pressing challenges of convergence and overstretch.  A strategy of integration is recommended to address these challenges and it follows the principles of whole-of-government security and sustainable partnerships.  The application of these principles will require the ADF to emphasise capabilities with versatility and adaptability.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Security</field><field name="subject">national defence</field><field name="subject">defence policy</field><field name="subject">defence policies</field><field name="subject">Australian Defence Force</field><field name="subject">transitional security thinking</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fatigue crack propagation behaviour of welded and weld repaired 5083 aluminium alloy joints</field><field name="creator">Wu, Weidong, Aerospace &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Welding, as one of the most effective joining methods for metals, has been extensively applied in engineering usage for a long time. When cracks occur in the vicinity of weldments, weld repairs are frequently considered for crack repair to extend service life.  In order to evaluate to what extent the weld repair has improved the fatigue life of a cracked welded structure, it is necessary to be able to determine the residual life of the cracked welded joint, as well as the life of the weld repaired joint. Both these assessments require that the fatigue crack growth data be available. The determination of crack propagation rates of welded and weld repaired structures is thus of paramount importance to implement a damage tolerant approach to structural life extension. However, since most studies on welded joints so far have concentrated on fatigue life evaluation, at the present time only limited information is available on crack propagation rates in welded joints, and virtually none on fatigue behaviour and crack propagation in weld repaired joints.  This thesis has focused on examination of fatigue and crack propagation behaviour in as welded and weld repaired aluminium alloy 5083, a weldable marine grade alloy extensively used in construction of high speed ferries and aerospace structures.  Crack growth rates were measured during constant amplitude fatigue testing on unwelded, as-welded and weld repaired specimens of 5083-H321 aluminium alloy. A 3-D finite element analysis was conducted to determine the stress intensity factors for different lengths of crack taking into account the three-dimensional nature of the weld profile. The effects of crack closure due to weld residual stresses were evaluated by taking measurements of the crack opening displacements and utilised to determine the effective stress intensity factors for each condition. Metallurgical examinations and fractography of the fracture surface were conducted using an optical microscope and SEM. It was found that crack growth rates in welded plates are of the same order of magnitude as those of parent material when effective stress intensity factors were applied.

Based on Kolmogorov's Theorem on the existence of a process, we first present the Kolmogorov model for the HMMs under consideration. A new change of measure is introduced. The statistical properties of the Kolmogorov representation of an HMM are discussed on the canonical probability space. A special Kolmogorov measure is constructed. Meanwhile, the ergodicity of two expanded Markov chains is investigated.  In order to describe the uncertainty of HMMs, we study probability distance problems based on the Kolmogorov model of HMMs. Using a change of measure technique, the relative entropy and the relative entropy rate as probability distances between HMMs, are given in terms of the HMM parameters. Also, we obtain a new expression for a probability distance considered in the existing literature such that we can use an information state method to calculate it.  Furthermore, we introduce regular conditional relative entropy as an a posteriori probability distance to measure the discrepancy between HMMs when a realized observation sequence is given. A representation of the regular conditional relative entropy is derived based on the Radon-Nikodym derivative. Then a recursion for the regular conditional relative entropy is obtained using an information state method.  Meanwhile, the well-known duality relationship between free energy and relative entropy is extended to the case of regular conditional relative entropy given a sub-[special character]-algebra. Finally, regular conditional relative entropy constraints are defined based on the study of the probability distance problem. Using a Lagrange multiplier technique and the duality relationship for regular conditional relative entropy, a finite horizon robust state estimator for HMMs with regular conditional relative entropy constraints is derived. A complete characterization of the solution to the robust state estimation problem is also presented.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entropy</field><field name="subject">estimation</field><field name="subject">hidden Markov models (HMM)</field><field name="subject">Kolmogorov</field><field name="subject">Markov processes</field><field name="subject">optimization</field><field name="subject">posteriori</field><field name="subject">probability</field><field name="subject">robust state estimator</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38664</field></doc><doc><field name="title">W3 Trust Model (W3TM): a trust-profiling framework to assess trust and transitivity of trust of web-based services in a heterogeneous web environment</field><field name="creator">Yang, Yinan, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The growth of eCommerce is being hampered by a lack of trust between providers and consumers of Web-based services. While Web trust issues have been addressed by researchers in many disciplines, a comprehensive approach has yet to be established. This thesis proposes a conceptual trust-profiling framework???W3TF???which addresses issues of trust and user confidence through a range of new user-centred trust measures???trust categories, trust domains, transitivity of trust, fading factor analysis, standalone assessment, hyperlinked assessment and relevance assessment. While others now use the concept of transitivity of trust, it was first introduced by this research in 1998. The thesis also illustrates how W3TF can narrow the gap/disconnection between the hierarchical PKI trust environment and the horizontal Web referral environment. The framework incorporates existing measures of trust (such as Public Key Infrastructure), takes account of consumer perceptions by identifying trust attributes, and utilises Web technology (in the form of metadata), to create a practical, flexible and comprehensive approach to trust assessment. The versatility of the W3TF is demonstrated by applying it to a variety of cases from trust literature and to the hypothetical case study that provided the initial stimulus for this research. It is shown that the framework can be expanded to accommodate new trust attributes, categories and domains, and that trust can be ???weighed??? (and therefore evaluated) by using various mathematical formulae based on different theories and policies. The W3TF addresses identified needs, narrows the gaps in existing approaches and provides a mechanism to embrace current and future efforts in trust management. The framework is a generic form of trust assessment that can help build user confidence in an eCommerce environment. For service providers, it offers an incentive to create websites with a high number of desired trust attributes. For consumers, it enables more reliable judgments to be made. Hence, Web trust can be enhanced.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer security</field><field name="subject">consumer confidence</field><field name="subject">eCommerce</field><field name="subject">electronic commerce</field><field name="subject">electronic data interchange</field><field name="subject">metadata</field><field name="subject">online trust</field><field name="subject">online service providers</field><field name="subject">security measures</field><field name="subject">transitivity of trust</field><field name="subject">trust</field><field name="subject">trust-profiling framework</field><field name="subject">trust relationship</field><field name="subject">web services</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deriving bathymetry from multispectral and hyperspectral imagery</field><field name="creator">Carmody, James Daniel, Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Knowledge of water depth is a crucial for planning military amphibious operations. Bathymetry from remote sensing with multispectral or hyperspectral imagery provides an opportunity to acquire water depth data faster than traditional hydrographic survey methods without the need to deploy a hydrographic survey vessel. It also provides a means of collecting bathymetric data covertly. This research explores two techniques for deriving bathymetry and assesses them for use by those involved in providing support to military operations. To support this aim a fieldwork campaign was undertaken in May, 2000, in northern Queensland. The fieldwork collected various inherent and apparent water optical properties and was concurrent with airborne hyperspectral imagery collection, space-based multispectral imagery collection and a hydrographic survey. The water optical properties were used to characterise the water and to understand how they affect deriving bathymetry from imagery. The hydrographic data was used to assess the performance of the bathymetric techniques. Two methods for deriving bathymetry were trialled. One uses a ratio of subsurface irradiance reflectance at two wavelengths and then tunes the result with known water depths. The other inverts the radiative transfer equation utilising the optical properties of the water to derive water depth. Both techniques derived water depth down to approximately six to seven metres. At that point the Cowley Beach waters became optically deep. Sensitivity analysis of the inversion method found that it was most sensitive to errors in vertical attenuation Kd and to errors in transforming the imagery into subsurface irradiance reflectance, R(0-) units. Both techniques require a priori knowledge to derive depth and a more sophisticated approach would be required to determine water depth without prior knowledge of the area of interest. This research demonstrates that water depth can be accurately mapped with optical techniques in less than ideal optical conditions. It also demonstrates that the collection of inherent and apparent optical properties is important for validating remotely sensed imagery.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oceanography</field><field name="subject">remote sensing</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">bathymetric maps</field><field name="subject">bathymetry</field><field name="subject">multi-spectral</field><field name="subject">hyper-spectral imagery</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Image registration and super-resolution mosaicing</field><field name="creator">Ye, Getian, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents new approaches to image registration and super-resolution mosaicing as well as their applications. Firstly, a feature-based image registration method is proposed for a multisensor surveillance system that consists of an optical camera and an infrared camera. By integrating a non-rigid object tracking technique into this method, a novel approach to simultaneous object tracking and multisensor image registration is proposed. Based on the registration and fusion of multisensor information, automatic face detection is greatly improved.  Secondly, some extensions of a gradient-based image registration method, called inverse compositional algorithm, are proposed. These extensions include cumulative multi-image registration and the incorporation of illumination change and lens distortion correction. They are incorporated into the framework of the original algorithm in a consistent manner and efficiency can still be achieved for multi-image registration with illumination and lens distortion correction.  Thirdly, new super-resolution mosaicing algorithms are proposed for multiple uncompressed and compressed images. Considering the process of image formation, observation models are introduced to describe the relationship between the superresolution mosaic image and the uncompressed and compressed low-resolution images. To improve the performance of super-resolution mosaicing, a wavelet-based image interpolation technique and an approach to adaptive determination of the regularization parameter are presented. For compressed images, a spatial-domain algorithm and a transform-domain algorithm are proposed. All the proposed superresolution mosaicing algorithms are robust against outliers. They can produce superresolution mosaics and reconstructed super-resolution images with improved subjective quality.  Finally, new techniques for super-resolution sprite generation and super-resolution sprite coding are proposed. Considering both short-term and long-term motion influences, an object-based image registration method is proposed for handling long image sequences. In order to remove the influence of outliers, a robust technique for super-resolution sprite generation is presented. This technique produces sprite images and reconstructed super-resolution images with high visual quality. Moreover, it provides better reconstructed low-resolution images compared with low-resolution sprite generation techniques. Due to the advantages of the super-resolution sprite, a super-resolution sprite coding technique is also proposed. It achieves high coding efficiency especially at a low bit-rate and produces both decoded low-resolution and super-resolution images with improved subjective quality. Throughout this work, the performance of all the proposed algorithms is evaluated using both synthetic and real image sequences.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automatic face detection</field><field name="subject">image compression</field><field name="subject">image fusion</field><field name="subject">image registration</field><field name="subject">information fusion</field><field name="subject">mosaicing</field><field name="subject">multisensor image</field><field name="subject">multi-sprite techniques</field><field name="subject">object tracking</field><field name="subject">super-resolution</field><field name="subject">surveillance</field><field name="subject">video coding</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Error resilience for video coding services over packet-based networks</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Jian, Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Error resilience is an important issue when coded video data is transmitted over wired and wireless networks. Errors can be introduced by network congestion, mis-routing and channel noise. These transmission errors can result in bit errors being introduced into the transmitted data or packets of data being completely lost. Consequently, the quality of the decoded video is degraded significantly. This thesis describes new techniques for minimising this degradation.  To verify video error resilience tools, it is first necessary to consider the methods used to carry out experimental measurements. For most audio-visual services, streams of both audio and video data need to be simultaneously transmitted on a single channel. The inclusion of the impact of multiplexing schemes, such as MPEG 2 Systems, in error resilience studies is also an important consideration. It is shown that error resilience measurements including the effect of the Systems Layer differ significantly from those based only on the Video Layer.  Two major issues of error resilience are investigated within this thesis. They are resynchronisation after error detection and error concealment. Results for resynchronisation using small slices, adaptive slice sizes and macroblock resynchronisation schemes are provided. These measurements show that the macroblock resynchronisation scheme achieves the best performance although it is not included in MPEG2 standard. The performance of the adaptive slice size scheme, however, is similar to that of the macroblock resynchronisation scheme. This approach is compatible with the MPEG 2 standard.  The most important contribution of this thesis is a new concealment technique, namely, Decoder Motion Vector Estimation (DMVE). The decoded video quality can be improved significantly with this technique. Basically, this technique utilises the temporal redundancy between the current and the previous frames, and the correlation between lost macroblocks and their surrounding pixels. Therefore, motion estimation can be applied again to search in the previous picture for a match to those lost macroblocks. The process is similar to that the encoder performs, but it is in the decoder.  The integration of techniques such as DMVE with small slices, or adaptive slice sizes or macroblock resynchronisation is also evaluated. This provides an overview of the performance produced by individual techniques compared to the combined techniques. Results show that high performance can be achieved by integrating DMVE with an effective resynchronisation scheme, even at a high cell loss rates.  The results of this thesis demonstrate clearly that the MPEG 2 standard is capable of providing a high level of error resilience, even in the presence of high loss. The key to this performance is appropriate tuning of encoders and effective concealment in decoders.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Video coding</field><field name="subject">digital transmission network</field><field name="subject">error resilient</field><field name="subject">error detection</field><field name="subject">macroblock resynchronisation</field><field name="subject">MPEG</field><field name="subject">error-correcting codes (Information theory)</field><field name="subject">Data compression (Telecommunication)</field><field name="subject">encoders</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bewtween war and peace : the experience of occupation for members of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, 1945-1952</field><field name="creator">Carter, Carolyne, History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the British Commonwealth experience of occupation in Japan from 1945-1952. It draws on official and private records from the four participating British Commonwealth countries ??? Australia, Britain, India and New Zealand- to examine the complex relationship that developed between the occupying troops and the occupied Japanese population in the period between the cessation of hostilities and the formal ratification of a Peace Treaty. The thesis begins with an analysis of the preconceptions British Commonwealth troops brought with them to Japan, to establish the context for their cross-cultural encounter with Japan and the Japanese people. An understanding of the historical background enables the impressions formed by BCOF troops during the occupation to be presented not as random observations, but as part of a tradition of contact and cultural critique.  The British Commonwealth experience in Japan was shaped by a number of external factors. Delays in moving to Japan weakened media and public interest in the force, eroded morale and precipitated a ???foreign force??? mentality. Once in Japan, the dominant US presence, the subordinate status of BCOF and the shortcomings of the isolated, rural area allocated to the force were a source of disappointment and frustration. But the difficulties attending British Commonwealth involvement in the occupation should not obscure the simultaneous development of a significant cultural encounter. The circumstances of the occupation created a particular dynamic between BCOF troops and Japanese civilians. The responsibilities and obligations that SCAP conferred on the British Commonwealth force invested BCOF personnel with authority over the Japanese. The disparity in power was reinforced by participation in occupation tasks that confirmed their status as occupiers.  The occupation relationship was heavily influenced by the nature of personal interactions established between BCOF personnel and the Japanese people. Service in Japan provided opportunities for troops to reassess their views of the Japanese in the light of personal experience. For some, the cultural differences they observed only reinforced their sense of the ???otherness??? of the Japanese. For many others, the occupation provided a bridge between war and peace, as contact with Japanese people eased the intense hatreds generated during the war. For most British Commonwealth personnel, service with BCOF impacted in some way on the beliefs they held about Japan and the Japanese.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">India</field><field name="subject">Britain</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">Cross-cultural relationships</field><field name="subject">Occupiers</field><field name="subject">military control</field><field name="subject">policing</field><field name="subject">military occupation</field><field name="subject">occupation relations</field><field name="subject">demilitarising</field><field name="subject">Allied occupation 1942-1952</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of wool scouring</field><field name="creator">Caunce, James Frederick, Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wool scouring is the first stage of wool processing, where unwanted contaminants are removed from freshly shorn wool. In most scouring machines wool is fed as a continuous mat through a series of water-filled scour and rinse bowls which are periodically drained. The purpose of this project is to mathematically model the scour bowl with the aim of improving efficiency. In this thesis four novel models of contaminant concentration within a scour bowl are developed. These are used to investigate the relationships between the operating parameters of the machine and the concentration of contamination within the scour bowl. The models use the advection-diffusion equation to simulate the settling and mixing of contamination. In the first model considered here, the scour bowl is simulated numerically using finite difference methods. Previous models of the scouring process only considered the average steady-state concentration of contamination within the entire scour bowl. This is the first wool scouring model to look at the bowl in two dimensions and to give time dependent results, hence allowing the effect of different drainage patterns to be studied. The second model looks at the important region at the top of the bowl - where the wool and water mix. The governing equations are solved analytically by averaging the concentration vertically assuming the wool layer is thin. Asymptotic analysis on this model reveals some of the fundamental behaviour of the system. The third model considers the same region by solving the governing equations through separation of variables. A fourth, fully two-dimensional, time dependent model was developed and solved using a finite element method. A model of the swelling of grease on the wool fibres is also considered since some grease can only be removed from the fibre once swollen. The swelling is modelled as a Stefan problem, a nonlinear diffusion equation with two moving boundaries, in cylindrical coordinates. Both approximate, analytical and a numerical solutions are found.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wool scouring</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">wool processing</field><field name="subject">scour bowl</field><field name="subject">contaminant</field><field name="subject">finite element</field><field name="subject">advection-diffusion equation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PAP Singapore: a case study of stationary bandit in a market economy</field><field name="creator">Chan, Heng Kong, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study investigates the role of the state in Singapore???s political economy. The conventional methodology in the neoclassical economics tradition is essentially apolitical and is thus inadequate to appraise the inner working mechanism of the Singapore polity, given the pervasive influence of politics in policy decisions. This study therefore synthesizes a new analytical methodology, drawn from neo-institutionalism, to analyse the interrelations of state, market and social institutions in the Singapore of the People???s Action Party (PAP). Ronald Coase???s theorem of transaction costs, Steven Cheung???s economics of property rights and Douglass North???s theories of institutions and institutional change, collectively, provide a theoretical framework that allows this study to examine the intrinsic nature and characteristics of the Singapore polity.  Three major areas are investigated using this research paradigm. The first is the post-war political transition from colony to self-rule and the eventual emergence of an independent Singapore in the context of Cold War politics. The second is the process of social engineering through reconstitution, resettlement and socialization, a process that has aimed to alter the institutional environment that regulates the state and people and has tended to generate a submissive social ethos. The focus of the third is the redefining of property rights through nationalization, industrialisation, and privatisation that, in effect, has resulted in the extensive transfer of private wealth to the state.  Four case studies are offered to demonstrate the impact of politics in the making of economic policy, the general effect of which has been to eradicate entrepreneurs in favour of state-owned entities. The analysis concludes that Singapore is essentially to be characterised as a predatory state, and adopts Mancur Olson???s ???stationary bandit??? theory to reconcile the state???s predatory behaviour with Singapore???s record of positive economic development. The study identifies nine unique features that have characterised the Singapore polity, the single most important feature being the emergence of ???Lee???s Law??? which amounts to the paramount Singapore informal rule in regulating all aspect of social exchange. It is paramount because without reference to this rule the inner working mechanism of Singapore???s political economy cannot be explicated. But the predominance of PAP control imposes a heavy social cost as it risks Singapore???s long-term viability as a national state because of the likely emergence of distributional collusion and institutional sclerosis. Singapore???s long-term viability is therefore contingent upon the kind of political reformation that would reinstitute a low transaction cost mediation mechanism that would then facilitate incremental institutional change.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">People's Action Party (Singapore)</field><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="subject">Propert</field><field name="subject">Social structure</field><field name="subject">Politics and government</field><field name="subject">Economic conditions</field><field name="subject">Social environment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38649</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Short wave infrared spectral response of fluvial channel sands in the Towamba River, NSW, Australia :  implications for sediment tracing</field><field name="creator">Crowell, Kelly Jean, Geography &amp; Oceanography, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Emergent spatial signals which may be interpreted in the context of fluvial sediment transport processes are detected through the use of reflectance spectroscopy in the sand-sized sediments of the Towamba River, southeastern New South Wales.  Reflectance spectroscopy of sufficiently fine spectral resolution represents a technique for mineral composition analysis which is complementary to X-ray diffraction, with advantages in terms of ease of sample preparation and rapidity of measurement. Instrumentation is available allowing high-quality spectrum acquisition in the field and from airborne and satellite-borne instruments. The former allows mineral analyses to more easily be incorporated into sediment tracing studies as an additional variable. The latter offers large scale, repeatable areal coverage of a dynamic system in which sediments are exposed to the sky.  The Towamba River drains a catchment of c. 1000 km [square] in extensively altered granitic terrain along the south coast of New South Wales, and carries significant quantities of sand-sized sediment through much of the system. Pervasive but spatially variable chlorite, epidote, and sericite have been described in local and neighbouring terrain. These are spectrally active in the SWIR wavelength region in which the PIMA portable spectrometer operates. The airborne HyMap instrument is sensitive through this range as well as through the visible and near-infrared regions. Conventionally such channel sediments would represent a single class in the context of the broader landscape, and comparatively they represent a domain of restricted variance.  In this study of samples of sediment were collected for analysis with the PIMA, the results of which supported the efficacy of such an exercise in a conventional tracing context and supported analysis of HyMap imagery. Although issues related to reduction of HyMap-detected radiance to reflectance prevented effective analysis of the shorter wavelengths sensitive to the presence of ferrous and ferric iron, the consideration of absorption feature depths and the application of a matched filtering operator revealed gross-scale spatial patterns which were interpreted as two populations of sand in the main channel. This interpretation is consistent with bank erosion occurring during two very large magnitude flow events in the 1970s, with minor ongoing perturbation of the sediment signal in the main channel by the contribution of sediment from tributaries.  The presence of a definite spatial signal having been established, routes for further investigation are suggested. A noisy signal hypothesised on the basis of imagery may be used to better direct a field sampling program for a conventional sediment tracing study. The signal to noise ratio may be improved for example through calibration of radiance to reflectance and removal of atmospheric interference and improved field sampling schemes, after which more rigorous, quantitative exercises such as geostatistical ???field??? trial or spatial series analysis may be performed. Connections to process through sediment transport models are enabled through the use of GIS.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reflectance spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">sediment transport</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Towamba River.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38680</field></doc><doc><field name="title">While freedom lives : political preoccupations in the writing of Marjorie Barnard and Frank Dalby Davison, 1935-1947</field><field name="creator">Darby, Robert, English, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The problem with which this thesis is concerned is the relationship between literature and politics. By means of a biographical and historical study two significant writers of the 1930s/40s I examine the ways in which the pressures of Depression, the threat of fascism and the onset of war influenced Australian writing. In particular, I ask whether the political issues of the period affected what these authors wrote and how they wrote it.  My conclusion is that pressure of political concern caused significant personal, philosophical and political changes in Barnard and Davison, and that it affected both the genre in which they wrote and the content of their fiction. They turned from fiction to cultural commentary, historical writing, political pamphleteering and activism. They utilised short fiction as a means of discussing their worries about the state of the world and in order to promote values they felt threatened. When they returned to longer fiction their work bore, to differing degrees, in its ideas, arguments and imagery, the influence of their political engagement.  More generally, I conclude that liberal humanism was the major animating philosophy of writers in the 1930s and that their concern with political issues grew from their conviction that western liberal democracy was the most fruitful soil for the production of art, a climate of freedom which they felt threatened by both fascism and war. This anxiety is the most important factor in both their politicisation and the work they did under the latter???s influence.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian literature</field><field name="subject">Frank Dalby Davison</field><field name="subject">Marjorie Barnard</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">social protest</field><field name="subject">censorship</field><field name="subject">war</field><field name="subject">civil liberties</field><field name="subject">novels</field><field name="subject">short stories</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of wildfire on the spotted-tailed quoll Dasyurus maculatus in Kosciuszko National Park</field><field name="creator">Dawson, James Patrick, Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">A population of spotted-tailed quolls Dasyurus maculatus was studied for three years (2002-2004) in the lower catchment of the Jacobs River, in the Byadbo Wilderness Area of southern Kosciuszko National Park, south-eastern New South Wales, Australia. Survey and monitoring of quoll latrine sites and prey populations, dietary analysis and live-trapping was carried out for one year before and two years after the widespread wildfires of January 2003, which had a very high impact on the study area. Survey for spotted-tailed quoll latrine sites was successful in locating a total of 90 latrine sites in the Jacobs River study area over the three years of the study. These were found throughout all parts of the topography among large, complex granite outcrops and along rocky sections of riparian habitat. After the fire in 2003, lower numbers of latrines were in use than observed pre-fire, and there was a lower level of usage (number of scats) of individual latrines. Continued monitoring in 2004 revealed that many latrines that had become inactive in 2003 following the fire were re-activated in the second breeding season following fire. 1466 spotted-tailed quoll scats were collected from latrines and live-trapped quolls over the three years of the study. Hair analysis from scats identified twenty-two different species of mammal in the diet of the spotted-tailed quoll from the Jacobs River study area, representing the majority of all prey identified (98.5% occurrence) and contributing almost all of the biomass consumed (99.6%). Medium-sized mammals were the most important prey category, followed by small mammals, large mammals (most likely taken as carrion) and non-mammalian prey (birds, reptiles, insects and plants). Brushtail possums were the most important single prey item by both frequency of occurrence and percentage biomass in all years, followed by lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), Rattus spp., and swamp wallabies. There was a significant difference in the composition of the diet by major prey category across the years of the study as a result of the fire, indicated by a shift in utilisation of food resources by quolls in response to significant changes in prey  availability. Monitoring of prey populations revealed that brushtail possums, lagomorphs and bandicoots were all significantly less abundant in the study area in the winter directly following the fire, followed by a significant increase in abundance of lagomorphs, but not of possums, in the second winter after the fire. Quolls adapted well to this altered prey availability. While there was a significant decrease in occurrence of brushtail possum in scats after the fire, significantly more scats contained hair of lagomorphs, to the point where almost equal proportions of lagomorphs and possum hair occurred in scats by the winter of 2004. Other fire-induced changes to the diet were evident, such as a significant drop in the occurrence of small mammals in scats for both winters after the fire, and a peak in occurrence of large mammals in the winter directly following the fire that strongly suggests there was a short-term increase in the availability of carrion. A large, high-density population of spotted-tailed quolls was live-trapped and marked during the winter breeding season of 2002. Twenty-two quolls (13 male and 9 female) were present in the study area in 2002, and subsequent trapping over the 2003 and 2004 winter breeding seasons following the fire revealed that the high-intensity wildfire did not result in the extinction of the local population. There was evidence of a small, short-term decline in the number of quolls present in the study area in the 2003 breeding season, with 16 individual quolls captured. Males were outnumbered two-to-one by females, due either to mortality or emigration. Trapping in 2004 showed a recovery of the population to numbers exceeding that observed prior to the fire, with 26 individuals captured (16 male, 10 female), most likely as a result of immigration. There was some evidence that recruitment of young from the post-fire breeding season in 2003 was reduced because of the fire. This study took advantage of an unplanned wildfire event to monitor the response of a population of spotted-tailed quolls and their prey. In this regard it was fortuitous since it has been recognised that the use of replicates and controls in the study of the impacts of wildfire on such species is likely to be logistically impossible. Consequently, the effects of fire on forest and woodland fauna such as the spotted-tailed quoll are poorly understood, with many authors expressing concern that, potentially, wildfires are likely to be highly detrimental to resident quoll populations. The results of this study, however, concur with the few other studies in which forest mammal populations have been monitored before and after wildfire in suggesting that wildfires may not be as destructive to fauna as that imagined. The results of this work will provide information to assist in the preparation of management strategies for the species, such as recovery plans, as well as information for land managers preparing management plans, including fire management plans, for habitats in which spotted-tailed quolls are found throughout their range.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Byadbo Wilderness Area</field><field name="subject">dasyurus maculatus</field><field name="subject">diet</field><field name="subject">fauna</field><field name="subject">fire</field><field name="subject">Jacobs River</field><field name="subject">Kosciuszko National Park</field><field name="subject">latrines</field><field name="subject">mammals</field><field name="subject">monitor</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">non-mammalian</field><field name="subject">populationa</field><field name="subject">post-fire</field><field name="subject">pre-fire</field><field name="subject">prey</field><field name="subject">scatology</field><field name="subject">spotted-tailed quoll</field><field name="subject">survey</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38669</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Redefinition of Asia : Australian Foreign Policy and Contemporary Asian Regionalism</field><field name="creator">de Somer, Gregory John, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis set out to ascertain the position of recent Australian Governments on the latest instalments of Asian regionalism in the context of an assessment of whether there has been a redefinition of Asia and thus a redefinition of Australia???s engagement with Asia. It will concentrate on the broad themes of politico-strategic and economic engagement. Whilst there has been extensive research and documentation on the Asian economic crisis there has been less work on the issue of a new Asian regionalism and the implications for Australia???s complex and variable engagement with the region. This is the basis for the claim to originality of this thesis, a claim supported by its focus on the practical and policy implications of Australia???s engagement, or lack of it, with regional institutions.  The process of regional integration has been extremely slow, thus supporting the conclusion that there is no evidence of a major redefinition of Asia. Efforts at Asian regionalism are meeting obstacles that pose immense challenges. Asian regionalism remains nascent and poorly defined. This reflects the diversity and enormous disparities in cultures, political systems and the levels of economic development and differences over economic philosophies within East Asia.  What is discernible is that the regionalism is proceeding more rapidly on financial issues than on trade, and in the security area it is conspicuously absent.  This research highlights the fact that the question of Asian engagement remains a sensitive issue in Australia and continues to grow more complex. Australia???s engagement with Asia since 1996 has been variable because of the Howard Government???s broader balance of priorities between global and regional issues, and because of the changing nature of the Asian region. The perception gleaned from sources is that, for the Australian Government, regionalism initiatives are characterised by much discussion but lack substance.  Consequently, this appears to have led the Government to the position that exclusion from some manifestations of regionalism is not so important. Australia is excluded from some of the regional architectures being constructed. In its efforts to seek inclusion in ASEAN + 3 and ASEM, Australia is facing the same barriers that have stood in the way of an AFTA-CER agreement. Exclusion would be important if the performance of regional groupings was not so indifferent. Exclusion from ASEAN + 3 and ASEM, however, does not equate to Australia???s exclusion from the region.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AEM</field><field name="subject">AFTA</field><field name="subject">AFTA-CER</field><field name="subject">ASEAN plus China Japan ROK</field><field name="subject">ASEM</field><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">Asian economic crisis</field><field name="subject">Asia-Europe Meeting</field><field name="subject">ASEAN Free Trade Area</field><field name="subject">ASEAN Free Trade Area (Australia-New Zealand) Closer Economic Relations Agreement</field><field name="subject">Asia region</field><field name="subject">Asian regionalism</field><field name="subject">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian defence debate</field><field name="subject">Australian foreign policy</field><field name="subject">Australian foreign relations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and evaluation of automated radar systems for monitoring and characterising echoes from insect targets</field><field name="creator">Dean, Timothy J., Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the construction of a mobile Insect Monitoring Radars (IMR) and investigations of: the reliability of IMRs for observing insect migration in inland Australia; possible biases in IMR migration estimates; the relation between an insect???s size and its radar properties; radar discrimination between insect species; the effect of weather on the migrations of Australian plague locusts and of moths; the scale of these migrations; and here IMRs are best located. The principles of entomological radar design, and the main features of insect migration in inland Australia, are reviewed. The main procedures used in the study are: calculation of radar performance and of insect radar cross sections (RCSs); reanalysis of a laboratory RCS dataset; statistical analysis of a fouryear dataset of IMR and weather observations; and a field campaign using both two existing fixed IMRs and the new mobile unit. Statistical techniques used include correlation, multiple regression, discriminant analysis, and principal components analysis. The original results of this work include design details of the mobile IMR, extension of radar performance calculations to IMRs and evaluation of flight speed biases, a holistic approach to IMR design, the relation of insect RCS magnitudes and polarization patterns to morphological variables, an estimate of the accuracy of the retrieved parameters, evaluations of three approaches (oneparameter, theory-based, and a novel two-stage method) to target identification, and verification of inferred target identities using results from nearby light traps. Possible sites for future IMRs are identified. The major conclusions are that: a mobile IMR can be built with a performance equal to that of a fixed IMR but at half the cost; significant biases in the signal processing results arise from insect speed; locusts and moths can be distinguished if all RCS parameters are used; IMRs can be designed to match particular requirements; weather has a significant effect on insect migration, the best single predictor of insect numbers being temperature; moonlight has no effect; the spatial correlation of migration properties falls to 50% at a separation of 300 km; and migrating insects can be carried by the wind for 500 km in a single night</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile insect monitoring radars (IMR)</field><field name="subject">insect migration</field><field name="subject">entomological radar design</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">weather</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="subject">signal processing</field><field name="subject">environmental factors</field><field name="subject">spring moth</field><field name="subject">plague locust</field><field name="subject">radar</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38667</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of water displacing corrosion preventatives on the fatigue behaviour of mechanically fastened aluminium joints</field><field name="creator">Dhamari, Ruby Dharma Adji, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Two failure mechanisms in a double lap joint are investigated. Analytical models of net-section and gross-section failure modes are proposed to describe these mechanisms. The effects of lamping force, interference fit, maximum axial load and WDCP on fatigue performance of the joint are included in the models. The effect of WDCP is assumed to give a reduction in friction coefficient. Three types of stress reduction factors are proposed in the net-section failure model to account for these parameters. The stress reduction factors modify stress range that is used in crack growth calculation. If there are no effects of these parameters, the stress reduction factors are equal to one. Two types of fretting stress are introduced in gross-section failure model to describe either sliding contact or incipient sliding contact on faying surface. The fretting stress is combined with body stress to modify stress range. The net-section failure model predicts that fatigue life is increasing as interference fit, clamping force and friction coefficient increase. The gross-section failure model predicts that fatigue life is decreasing as clamping force and friction coefficient increase. Both models predict that fatigue life is decreasing as maximum axial load increases. Transition of the failure mode occurs earlier as friction coefficient and interference fit increase, while it is delayed as maximum axial load increases. A transition parameter is proposed to establish a relationship between the four main parameters. The transition parameter is expressed in a polynomial equation. It gives an optimum combination of the four main parameters in order to achieve relatively higher fatigue life by having gross-section failure mode. Finite element analysis and fatigue testing are performed to validate the models. The finite element and the analytical models show that stress concentration factor at the edge of the hole is decreasing as clamping force increases. The rate of decrease of stress concentration factor is increasing as friction coefficient increases. While stress concentration factor on the faying surface is increasing as clamping force and friction coefficient increase. Fatigue testing reveals that the fatigue life of the joint is in good agreement with the predicted fatigue life of the proposed models.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Axial applied load</field><field name="subject">aluminium</field><field name="subject">clamping</field><field name="subject">corrosion preventatives</field><field name="subject">crack</field><field name="subject">cracking</field><field name="subject">double-shear lap joint</field><field name="subject">fastener hole</field><field name="subject">fatigue testing</field><field name="subject">finite element</field><field name="subject">fracture</field><field name="subject">fretting</field><field name="subject">friction coefficient</field><field name="subject">interference fit</field><field name="subject">joints</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">water-displacing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38668</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic characterisation of vibration isolators</field><field name="creator">Dickens, John D., Aerospace &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">A vibration isolator is designed to reduce the vibration and structure borne noise transmitted from a vibratory source, such as machinery and equipment, to the supporting structure. The vibration and structure borne noise transmitted depends upon the dynamic properties of the foundation, the source mounting point and the vibration isolator. Therefore knowledge of the frequency dependent dynamic properties of vibration isolators is a necessary part of the acoustic prediction and control/reduction process.  Vibration isolators may be characterised by measuring their four-pole parameters. A measurement procedure is proposed that employs the floating mass method, measures the direct forces and corrects for the errors introduced by the direct force measurement. Compared to the basic method, it extends the frequency limits of measurement in both directions.  The development of a novel vibration isolator test facility that implements the proposed measurement procedure is described, and its satisfactory operation is experimentally demonstrated. The vibration isolator test facility is capable of characterizing vibration isolators commonly used in industrial and maritime applications, under service conditions.  A method is proposed for measuring the four-pole parameters of a uni-directional asymmetrical vibration isolator under static load. The method is called the two masses method, and is suitable for determining the four???pole parameters of active vibration isolators with feedback control. The method is also applicable to uni-directional symmetrical and bi-directional symmetrical and bi-directional asymmetrical vibration isolators. It may be regarded as a universal method for characterising vibration isolators. Experimental data is presented and the method is validated.  Modelling of vibration isolators is complicated by the highly non-linear nature of their rubber elements. The notion of an effective rubber cylinder is proposed to account for the barrelling of rubber elements under static load. Consequently, a general static compression model is proposed that applies to vibration isolators having unfilled and filled rubber elements of regular prismatic shapes. The model predicts the dependence of the four-pole parameters on the compression ratio of the rubber element. The predictions derived from the effective rubber cylinder and general static compression model agree excellently with experimental work of this study and other researchers.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vibration isolator</field><field name="subject">vibration</field><field name="subject">structure borne noise</field><field name="subject">four-pole parameters</field><field name="subject">floating mass method</field><field name="subject">uni-directional asymmetrical vibration isolator</field><field name="subject">two masses method</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The provocation of Saul Bellow : perfectionism and travel in The adventures of Augie March and Herzog</field><field name="creator">Atkinson, Adam, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">A consistent feature of Saul Bellow???s fiction is the protagonist???s encounter with one or more teaching figures. Dialogue with such individuals prompts the Bellovian protagonist to reject his current state of selfhood as inadequate and provokes him to re-form as a new person. The teacher figure offers a better self to which the protagonist is attracted; or, more frequently in Bellow, the protagonist is repelled by both his teacher and his own current state to form a new, previously unrepresented self. This thesis argues that Bellow???s self inherits and modifies the perfectionist philosophy of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, in a literary reinterpretation that parallels Stanley Cavell???s philosophical revaluation of the American Transcendentalists. In Emerson and Thoreau, and in Cavell???s reading of perfectionism, the self is attracted onward only by a better representation of selfhood in another, while Bellow???s self may also be, and often is, provoked by a repellent other to inhabit a new form of selfhood. This thesis takes the evolution of selfhood in Bellow to be structured by travel. In The Adventures of Augie March, Augie???s movement between selves is impelled by conversation with teacher figures and paralleled by his unending journeys. In Herzog, Herzog???s self-transformations and travels are provoked by reading and writing, and by the ecstasy of loss revealed to him through apostrophic conversations with the dead and absent in a series of unsent and mental letters. Letter-writing, the provocation for Herzog???s self-perfection, becomes a form of travel in Herzog. This thesis further argues that Bellow???s travelling self is a critical response to two poles of modern subjectivity, structured by European mythologies of travel: Bellow???s fiction is critical, first, of a Hegelian, egoist mode of selfhood structured after the Odyssey; but equally critical of examples of Levinasian openness to the Other, patterned on Abraham???s exile. Bellow does not accept either the Odyssean or the Abrahamic mode of selfhood on its own, recognizing oppressive possibilities in both. Travelling selfhood in Bellow, initiated by conversation with others, both fuses and rereads Odyssean and Abrahamic constructs within a new, but perpetually unfinished American mode of selfperfection.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Saul Bellow</field><field name="subject">Adventures of Augie March</field><field name="subject">selfhood</field><field name="subject">Herzog</field><field name="subject">criticism</field><field name="subject">interpretation</field><field name="subject">selfperfection</field><field name="subject">American fiction</field><field name="subject">modernism</field><field name="subject">influence</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">travels</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38676</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An improved low-Reynolds-number k-E [ symbol -dissipation rate]</field><field name="creator">Chen, Suzhen, Aerospace &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">[Formulae and special characters can only be approximated here. Please see the pdf version of the Abstract for an accurate reproduction.] Since the damping functions employed by most of the low-Reynolds-number models are related to the non-dimensional distance y+[ special character ??? near-wall non-dimensional distance in y direction], which is based on local wall shear stress, these models become invalid for separated flows, because the wall shear stress is zero at the reattachment point. In addition, the pressure-velocity correlation term is neglected in most of these models, although this term is shown in this thesis to be important in the near-wall region for simple flows and large pressure gradient flows. In this thesis, two main efforts are made to improve the k ??? [special character - dissipation rate] model. First, based on Myong and Kasagi???s (1990) low-Reynolds-number model (hereafter referred to as MK model), a more general damping function  [special character - turbulent viscosity damping function in LRN turbulent model] is postulated which only depends on the Reynolds numbers [formula ??? near-wall turbulence Reynolds number]. Second, a form for the pressure-velocity correlation term is postulated based on the Poisson equation for pressure fluctuations.  This modified model predicts the turbulent flow over a flat plate very well. It is found that the inclusion of the pressure-velocity correlation term leads to significant improvement of the prediction of near-wall turbulence kinetic energy. When the model is applied to turbulent flow over a backward-facing step, it produces better predictions than the traditional k ??? [special character - dissipation rate] model, FLUENT???s two-layer model and the MK model. Again, the pressure-velocity correlation term improves the turbulence kinetic energy prediction in the separated region over that of other models investigated here.  The studies of numerical methods concerning computational domain size and grid spacing reveal that a very large domain size is required for accurate flat plate flow computation. They also show that a fine grid distribution in the near-wall region upstream of the step is necessary for acceptable flow prediction accuracy in the downstream separated region.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Damping function</field><field name="subject">flat plate</field><field name="subject">flows</field><field name="subject">kinetic energy</field><field name="subject">near-wall</field><field name="subject">Reynolds number</field><field name="subject">turbulence</field><field name="subject">turbulent flow</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary cluster costing for weapon system early design</field><field name="creator">Chou, Chi-Wu, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Evolutionary Cluster Costing Methodology (ECCM) is proposed for estimating the cost of designing and producing a weapon system at the early design stage. The issue is related to the particular difficulties which system designers often encounter in the absence of cost data on present system details and historically relevant cases associated with the early development phase of a major acquisition project. This is especially relevant in the military environment. In general, the traditional approach for new system cost estimation is to use parametric methods with data from a number of historical cases. However, when there are limited cases it is difficult to establish appropriate and reliable cost models. As an approach to solving this problem, this research has developed ECCM to generate cost characteristics from only a few or even a single existing case to estimate new system costs.  The purpose of ECCM is to extract cost characteristics from an existing system by separating it into mutually independent function clusters. Accordingly, ECCM consists of three essentials: function activity cost tables (FACT), an evolutionary clustering methodology, and cost pattern usages. Based on value engineering and system engineering, a system is made up of a particular group of functions, and each function is further supported by certain activities. Because activities can be represented as resources used for supporting related functions, cost employment among functions can be allocated as FACT. As part of the process, a binary incident matrix is constructed, where the values 1 or 0 represent the existence or non-existence of cost interactions between activity and function in FACT. The binary matrix can easily be deduced to represent the most relevant function clusters. To solve the N-P complete combinatorial problem, evolutionary algorithms and proposed cluster evaluation formulae are integrated into the evolutionary clustering methodology. Once the optimal function clusters have been grouped, the costs that interact among functions and activities can be relisted and rated into ratios within each cluster. Cost patterns can then be determined by activity cost ratios from individual clusters. The cost of a new system can be evaluated by considering each similar cluster as a cost parameter because each cluster represents the cost characteristics of a particular function group. Based on the fact that the technology is evolving gradually and the functions in a cluster are related to each other through certain resource relationships, the cost of new systems or products can be estimated by using those clusters. The cost estimates for the new system are obtained through comparing the needs of technologies or values in similar function clusters of existing systems.  A case study from three generations of light-sport helicopters has shown that function and assembly clusters can be used to infer the cost of a new design. The results from the case study demonstrate that: 1) the various functions can be clustered to create a certain number of critical purposes, e.g., engine power or structural strength and safety related tasks; 2) ECCM can be used to estimate empirical costs given the absence of detailed design information; 3) the function and assembly similarities of clusters among systems are statistically significant; 4) the differences of cost ratios in related clusters between systems are not statistically significant; 5) the differences between cluster's estimated costs and actual costs in helicopter L-2 or L-3 are not significant statistically; and 6) the differences between assembly's estimated costs and actual costs in L-2 or L-3 are not significant statistically. The cost ratio patterns of individual clusters can be used to target the activity or assembly budgets for developing new systems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="subject">clusters</field><field name="subject">clustering</field><field name="subject">cost ratio patterns</field><field name="subject">costing</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">evolutionary</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">methodology</field><field name="subject">military equipment</field><field name="subject">system engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Spratly Islands dispute : decision units and domestic politics</field><field name="creator">Chung, Christopher, Humanities &amp; Social Science, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a cross-national, cross-regime examination of foreign policy decision-making in the Spratly Islands dispute, focusing on China, Malaysia and the Philippines. It argues that how and why these countries have acted in particular ways towards the dispute relates to the relationship among foreign policy decision-making, government behaviour and domestic politics.  The theoretical foundation of the study is foreign policy analysis. It applies the decision units approach advanced by Margaret and Charles Hermann and Joe Hagan to investigate who made foreign policy decisions on the Spratly Islands dispute in the three countries during the period 1991-2002, and how this influenced government behaviour. In addition, the contextual influence of domestic politics is considered. Four case studies inform the empirical analysis: the approaches taken by Malaysia and the Philippines to bolster their respective sovereignty claim, China???s establishment of a comprehensive maritime jurisdictional regime covering the Spratly Islands among other areas, China-Philippines contestation over Mischief Reef and the development of a regional instrument to regulate conduct in the South China Sea. 	Three conclusions are drawn. First, the decision units approach identifies the pivotal foreign policy decision-makers in each of the countries examined and the process involved. Second, it explains the relationship between decision unit characteristics -- self-contained or externally influenceable -- and each government???s behaviour towards the dispute. Injecting domestic politics into the analysis highlights motivations of and constraints faced by decision-makers, conditioning the form and content of government action. Third, it demonstrates a low predictive capability: the ???fit??? between hypothesised and actual government behaviour is poor.   While it is not a comprehensive analytical tool, the combined decision units-domestic politics approach offers deeper insight into government decisions and behaviour on the Spratly Islands dispute than hitherto reported in the literature.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ASEAN</field><field name="subject">ASEAN Regional Forum</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Code of conduct</field><field name="subject">South China Sea</field><field name="subject">domestic politics</field><field name="subject">Erica Reef</field><field name="subject">Foreign policy decision-making</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">international relations</field><field name="subject">Investigator Shoal</field><field name="subject">law of the sea</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">maritime boundary disputes</field><field name="subject">maritime security</field><field name="subject">Mischief Reef</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">South China Sea</field><field name="subject">South East Asia</field><field name="subject">Spratly Islands</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marching to their own drum : British Army officers as military commandants in the Australian colonies and New Zealand 1870-1901</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Stephen John, History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Between 1870 and 1901, seventeen officers from the British army were appointed by the governments of the Australian colonies and New Zealand as commanders of their colonial military forces. There has been considerable speculation about the roles of these officers as imperial agents, developing colonial forces as a wartime reserve to imperial forces, but little in depth research. This thesis examines the role of the imperial commandants with an embryonic system of imperial defence and their contribution to the development of the colonial military forces. It is therefore a topic in British imperial history as much as Australian and New Zealand military history.  British officers were appointed by colonial governments to overcome a shortfall in professional military expertise but increasingly came to be viewed by successive British administrations as a means of fulfilling an imperial defence agenda. The commandants as ???men-on-the-spot???, however, viewed themselves as independent reformers and got offside with both the imperial and colonial governments. This fact reveals that the commandants occupied a difficult position between the aspirations of London and the reality of the colonies. They certainly brought an imperial perspective to their commands and looked forward to the colonies playing a role on the imperial stage but generally did so in terms of a personal agenda rather than one set by London. This assessment is best demonstrated in the commandants??? independent stance at the outset of the South African War.  The practice of appointing British commandants in Australasia was fraught with problems because of an inherent conflict in the goals of the commandants and their colonial governments. It resembles the Canadian experience of the British officers which reveals that the system of imperials military appointments as a whole was flawed. The problem remained that until a sufficient number of colonial officers had the prerequisite professional expertise for high command there was no alternative. The commandants were therefore the beginning rather than the end of a traditional reliance upon British military expertise. The lasting legacy of the commandants for the military forces of Australia and New Zealand was the development of colonial officers, transference of British military traditions, and the encouragement of a colonial military identity premised on the expectation of future participation in defence of the empire. The study provides a major revision to the existing historiography of imperial officers in the colonies, one which concludes that far from being ???imperial agents??? they were largely marching to their own drum.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">Australasia</field><field name="subject">British Army</field><field name="subject">commandants</field><field name="subject">colonial forces</field><field name="subject">colonies</field><field name="subject">defence</field><field name="subject">imperial</field><field name="subject">military</field><field name="subject">officers</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">South African War</field><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">1890s</field><field name="subject">19th century</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Canadian official historians and the writing of the world wars</field><field name="creator">Cook, Tim, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation analyses academic military history and the writing of the World Wars in Canada. While there have been hundreds of books devoted to Canada???s role in the World Wars, few historians have examined the writing of that same history, or the archival records that were used to construct these narratives.  It has been the official historians of the Department of National Defence who, for much of the twentieth century, have controlled the historical writing of the World Wars, and that military history has been narrowly defined as the history of military operations. Training, administrating and operational war-fighting remained the focus. Only recently have academic military historians pushed the discipline of military history to explore the impact of the World Wars on Canadian society. Nonetheless, it remains the publications of A.F. Duguid, C.P. Stacy, Gilbert Tucker, Fred Hitchins, Joseph Schull, and more recent official historians that provide the central narrative when examining the writing on Canada???s World Wars. An exploration of key historians and their works reveals historical themes underpinning how memory and narrative of the World Wars has been constructed within historical writing.  The official historians were the guardians of memory and controllers of the past. Caught within the battles of reputations that followed the World Wars, they were forced to carefully navigate through these contested issues. Laying an interpretative frame-work, the official historians allowed subsequent generations to build upon and rework their findings, through writing their histories but also by acting as the archivists for their respective services. While the official histories have their flaws, they are also exceptionally important foundational studies that deserve greater attention and study in their own right.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Archive</field><field name="subject">archival</field><field name="subject">Canada</field><field name="subject">Canadian</field><field name="subject">historians</field><field name="subject">historical writing</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">military</field><field name="subject">official</field><field name="subject">war records</field><field name="subject">World Wars</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38660</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of electromagnetic force and noise in inverter driven induction motors</field><field name="creator">Astfalck, Allen, Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is part of a major research project to analyse vibro-acoustic characteristics from variable speed inverter driven induction motors (VSIDIM). The overall projects??? aimed at providing a better understanding of the mechanisms of sound generation from electromagnetic origins and developing a numerical model to predict the sound power emitted from a VSIDIM. The scope of this thesis is to assess experimentally the effect of various controller strategies on the radiated sound power and to develop a finite element method for calculating the electromagnetic force distribution over the stator.  Various sources of noise in induction motors and their behaviour with speed and load have been reviewed. Models of the electromagnetic field and vibro-acoustic character have been discussed. An outline of various techniques of reducing noise in induction motors through design of inverters and modifications to the motor structure has been given.  Experiments were conducted to assess the effect of controller strategies on the radiated sound power. Three different supplies were tested: a dynamotor which produces an almost sinusoidal supply with very low harmonic content, an inverter with a low switching frequency (less than 1kHz) and an inverter with a high switching frequency (8kHz) and various levels of random modulation. Results indicate that the sound power level of the MSC drive is a lot higher than that of the VSC 2000 drive and the dynamotor drive. The sound power level of the VSC 2000 drive and the dynamotor drive increases almost linearly with motor speed, that for the MSC drive is almost independent of speed. The sound power level of the MSC drive is almost 28dB higher than that of the dynamotor drive at 450rpm and the difference is reduced to 14dB at 1500rpm where the aerodynamic noise becomes more dominant. It has been found that at the rated speed (1500rpm), the sound power level varies by less than 3dB from no load to full load for all three sources.  Although increasing the switching frequency increases the cost of the inverters and switching losses, results from the MSC and VSC 2000 drives clearly show that it reduces the radiated sound power by shifting the harmonics into higher and inaudible frequency range. The tonal nature around the switching frequency has been reduced by increasing the levels of random modulation to spread the energy over a wider range of frequencies, although the sound power level has not varied by more than 0.2dB.  A finite element model has been developed to calculate the electromagnetic force distribution. The quasi-static solution method has been implemented by stepping the rotor through the time domain using a fine regular mesh in the air gap. The stator currents were experimentally obtained while the rotor currents were obtained using a 4 parameter state space model of the motor. Results of the simulation indicate the influence of stator and rotor slots, saturation and time harmonics in the current. The calculated electromagnetic force distribution has been used in a FEM/BEM acoustic model and SEA acoustic model to predict the radiated sound power which agrees reasonably well with the measured sound, thus validating indirectly the electromagnetic force simulations.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Induction motor</field><field name="subject">inverter</field><field name="subject">acoustic</field><field name="subject">vibration</field><field name="subject">finite element modelling</field><field name="subject">Maxwell force distribution</field><field name="subject">vibro-acoustic</field><field name="subject">radiated sound power</field><field name="subject">dynamotor drive</field><field name="subject">electromagnetic force distribution</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38671</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Track made good : a history of air navigation in the Royal Australian Air Force and its predecessor, the Australian Flying Corps ??? 1914 to 1945</field><field name="creator">Coyle, Tim, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Between 1914 and 1945 the Australian air services, the Australian Flying Corps (AFC ??? 1914 to 1919), the Australian Air Corps (AAC ??? 1920 to 1921) and their successor, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF ??? 1921 to 1945), developed from a marginally effective air arm into a major air force with a continental strike capability.  The interwar period saw a series of pioneering flights which not only laid the foundations for the air defence of Australia but also assisted in national development.  Essential to the development of the AFC and the RAAF was the practice of air navigation.  While much has been written on World War II RAAF operations, almost nothing has been published on the policy, training and practice of air navigation in support of wartime operations or the interwar period.  This omission is addressed by the examination of air navigation in the AFC and the RAAF from the rudiments of World War I to the emergence of air navigation as a critical specialist function which culminated in its practice in World War II tactical and strategic air operations.  It was the wartime development of Australian air power between 1939 and 1945, and the parallel practice of advanced navigation techniques, that underscored Australia???s contribution to the allied air offensive.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Royal Australian Air Force</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">World War</field><field name="subject">1914-1918</field><field name="subject">World War</field><field name="subject">1939-1945</field><field name="subject">aerial operations</field><field name="subject">navigation</field><field name="subject">navigators</field><field name="subject">aeronautics</field><field name="subject">Australian Flying Corps</field><field name="subject">RAAF</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38678</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parametric solitons due to cubic nonlinearities</field><field name="creator">Kolossovski, Kazimir, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The main subject of this thesis is solitons due to degenerate parametric four-wave mixing. Derivation of the governing equations is carried out for both spatial solitons (slab waveguide) and temporal solitons (optical fibre). Higher-order effects that are ignored in the standard paraxial approximation are discussed and estimated. Detailed analysis of conventional solitons is carried out. This includes discovery of various solitons families, linear stability analysis of fundamental and higher-order solitons, development of theory describing nonlinear dynamics of higher-order solitons. The major findings related to the stationary problem are bifurcation of a two-frequency soliton family from an asymptotic family of infinitely separated one-frequency solitons, jump bifurcation and violation of the bound state principle. Linear stability analysis shows a rich variety of internal modes of the fundamental solitons and existence of a stability window for higher-order solitons. Theory for nonlinear dynamics of higher-order solitons successfully predicts the position and size of the stability window, and various instability scenarios. Equivalence between direct asymptotic approach and invariant based approach is demonstrated. A general analytic approach for description of localised solutions that are in resonance with linear waves (quasi-solitons and embedded solitons) is given. This includes normal form theory and approximation of interacting particles. The main results are an expression for the amplitude of the radiating tail of a quasi-soliton, and a two-fold criterion for existence of embedded solitons. Influence of nonparaxiality on soliton stability is investigated. Stationary instability threshold is derived. The major results are shift and decreasing of the size of the stability window for higher-order solitons. The latter is the first demonstration of the destabilizing influence of nonparaxiality on higher-order solitons. Analysis of different aspects of solitons is based on universal approaches and methods. This includes Hamiltonian formalism, consideration of symmetry properties of the model, development of asymptotic models, construction of perturbation theory, application of general theorems etc. Thus, the results obtained can be extended beyond the particular model of degenerate four-wave mixing. All theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the results of direct numerical modeling.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Embedded soliton</field><field name="subject">quasi-soliton</field><field name="subject">parametric process</field><field name="subject">cubic nonlinearity</field><field name="subject">stability</field><field name="subject">bifurcation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The nearby young [special character] Chamaeleontis cluster as a laboratory for star formation and evolution</field><field name="creator">Lyo, A-Ran, Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">[Special characters cannot be displayed. Please see the pdf version of the Abstract for an accurate reproduction.] We studied the circumstellar discs, the initial mass function (IMF), mass distribution, binarity and the fundamental properties of the [special character] 9 Myr-old pre-main sequence (PMS)  [special character] Chamaeleontis cluster. Using JHKL colour-colour and colour-excess diagrams, we found the circumstellar disc fraction to be [special character] 0.60 among the late-type members. Four stars with [special character] (K - L) &gt; 0.4 were identified as experiencing ongoing accretion which was later confirmed by high-resolution spectroscopic study. Quantitative analysis of the H[special character] profiles found accretion in these four stars at rates comparable to that of two members of the similarly-aged TW Hydrae Association (TWA); rates 1 - 3 orders of magnitude lower than in younger classical T Tauri stars. Together these results suggest that, while the mass accretion rate decreases with age, PMS stars can retain their inner discs for [special character] 10 Myr. An optical photometric survey spanning 1.3 ?? 1.3 pc added two low-mass stars to the cluster inventory. Together with other recent surveys the population is likely to be significantly complete for primaries with masses M &gt; 0.15M[special character]. The cluster now consists of 18 primaries and 9 confirmed and candidate secondaries, with [special character] 2-4 times higher multiplicity than seen in field dwarfs. The cluster IMF is consistent with that of rich young clusters and field stars. By extending the IMF to lower masses, we predict 20-29 low-mass stars and brown dwarfs may remain undiscovered. From study of the cluster???s spatial and mass distribution, we find the [special character] Cha cluster has significant mass segregation, with &gt; 50 per cent of the stellar mass residing within the central 0.17 pc. Lastly we classified members of the cluster with low-resolution spectra, providing information about the fundamental properties of the PMS stars by comparison to standard dwarfs. Broadband VRI colours and pseudocontinuum indices derived for the cluster stars are indistinguishable from dwarfs at visual and red wavelengths. This suggests the temperature sequence for the PMS [special character] Cha cluster is similar to that of the dwarf sequence. Narrow-band spectral indices for the [special character]  Cha cluster possibly indicate higher metallicity and strongly indicate lower surface gravity than the dwarf indices.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bibary population</field><field name="subject">Chamaeleontis cluster</field><field name="subject">circumstellar disks</field><field name="subject">initial mass function (IMF)</field><field name="subject">mass dustribution</field><field name="subject">optical photometric</field><field name="subject">pre-main sequence (PMS)</field><field name="subject">spectroscopic</field><field name="subject">star evolution</field><field name="subject">star formation</field><field name="subject">starss</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian Army logistics 1943-1945</field><field name="creator">Mallett, Ross A., History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the logistical support of the Australian Army???s operations in the South West Pacific from January 1943 to August 1945.

Warfare in the twentieth warfare is characterised by the presence of certain technologies that give it a distinctive nature and which first  appeared in the Great War. It was in the Great War that the highly dispersed form of tactics that we know today emerged. Thus, it is a natural starting point not only for the examination of warfare in the era of technology but for considering the nature of technological change itself. My Australian perspective enabled issues to be looked at to a depth that would not be possible in a work of this length with a broader view.  I have argued that the Great War was characterised by the problem of trench warfare, and I have traced the progress of tactical, technological and organisational developments that ultimately supplied the solutions. I have also shown how the Great War was not only a war of technology in which new technologies were introduced and developed, but also one which saw the spread of new ways of thinking about military technology. In preparing this thesis, I have inspected the actual battlefields in France, Belgium and Turkey. I have drawn on a broad range of published material, but the thesis is largely based upon the primary documents found in the Australian War Memorial and Australian National Archives.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gallipoli</field><field name="subject">Western Front</field><field name="subject">Semi Open Warfare</field><field name="subject">Messines</field><field name="subject">Third Ypres</field><field name="subject">Sinai</field><field name="subject">Palestine</field><field name="subject">German Offensives</field><field name="subject">World War One</field><field name="subject">WWI</field><field name="subject">Australian Imperial Force</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Viscoplastic modelling of embankments on soft soils</field><field name="creator">Manivannan, Ganeshalingam, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">A major instrumented geosynthetic reinforced approach embankment was constructed to 5.5 m elevation above ground, with prefabricated vertical drains, over a soft compressible clay deposit at Leneghan, Newcastle, Australia in May 1995. The field monitoring of settlements for over six years shows that the embankment manifests significant creep. The instrumentation, field performance and the finite element analyses for predicting the long-term performance of this embankment are described in this thesis.  The maximum settlement of 1.1 m was observed one year after the completion of construction. However, the embankment continued to settle at a rate of 0.4 mm/day for the next 5 years. The horizontal displacements of 0.09-0.14 m at various locations and the maximum reinforcement strains of 0.67% were recorded.  A numerical model was developed to perform a fully coupled large deformation elasto-viscoplastic finite element analysis for this performance prediction based on creep model proposed by Kutter and Sathialingam (1992). The foundation soil was modelled with creep material behaviour using six noded linear strain triangular elements. A well-documented case history ??? Sackville embankment, New Brunswick, Canada was analysed using this model as a benchmark problem and the model was found to predict all the behaviour characteristics reasonably well. The results obtained from finite element analysis using this model are shown to be in reasonable agreement with the observed performance of Leneghans embankment in terms of settlements, horizontal displacements, excess pore pressures and geosynthetic strains. But, the prediction of settlements was less than satisfactory beyond April 1999.  Finite element analyses were performed to study the sensitivity of this embankment behaviour on the variation of hydraulic conductivity values and geosynthetic reinforcement properties. This sensitivity study indicated that the kv variation, the kh/kv ratio and the nominal values of geosynthetic properties adopted in the benchmark analysis are reasonable enough for the long-term behaviour prediction.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clay soil</field><field name="subject">creep behaviour</field><field name="subject">deformations</field><field name="subject">elastoplastic</field><field name="subject">elasto-viscoplastic</field><field name="subject">embankment</field><field name="subject">embankments</field><field name="subject">finite element program</field><field name="subject">geosynthetic</field><field name="subject">geotechnical structures</field><field name="subject">Leneghans</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="subject">models</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">numerical analysis</field><field name="subject">mathematical</field><field name="subject">reinforced</field><field name="subject">reinforcement</field><field name="subject">soft soils</field><field name="subject">vertical drains</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The once and future Army : an organizational, political and social history of the Citizen Military Forces, 1947-1974</field><field name="creator">McCarthy, Dayton S., History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the Citizen Military Forces (CMF) from 1947 until it ceased to exist under that name with the release of the report of the Millar Inquiry in 1974. This thesis examines three broad areas: the organizational changes that the CMF adopted or had imposed upon it; the political decision-making surrounding the CMF; and a social analysis of the CMF which questions the viability and validity of a number of the CMF???s long held precepts. The thesis will show that the majority of circumstances and decisions surrounding the CMF were beyond its control. For example, the CMF could not change the prevailing military thought of the post-war period which emphasized increasingly the role of smaller, professional, readily-available armies. The first three chapters recount the CMF???s ???heyday??? in which the Army, assisted by National Service after 1950, was based around it and its influence at the highest levels was strongest.  The next two chapters chronicle the background to Australia???s adoption of the  ???Pentropic??? organization and the repercussions this had on the CMF. Chapters Six and Seven examine the consequences of the introduction of a second compulsory service scheme and the concomitant result which precluded the CMF from operational service in Vietnam. Chapters Eight and Nine deal with the Millar Inquiry, which offered the CMF a new hope, but in some regards, brought forth little beneficial gains for the CMF. The final chapters analyze some of the characteristics unique to the CMF, such as territorial affiliation, high turnover rates amongst the rank and file and the concept of the ???brilliant amateur???. This thesis concludes that, despite the mixed performance of the CMF, there is still a place for the citizen soldier in contemporary warfare, but far more consideration at the highest political and military levels must be given to the peculiar and difficult, but by no means insurmountable, problems citizen soldiering encounters in Australia.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CMF</field><field name="subject">Citizen Military Force</field><field name="subject">Australian citizen soldier</field><field name="subject">Army Reserve</field><field name="subject">Citizen Army</field><field name="subject">Post-War CMF</field><field name="subject">CMF Officer Corps</field><field name="subject">CMF NCO</field><field name="subject">CMF Non-commissioned officers</field><field name="subject">CMF Officers</field><field name="subject">Defence Act</field><field name="subject">Military planning</field><field name="subject">Defence planning</field><field name="subject">Organizational structure</field><field name="subject">Social analysis</field><field name="subject">Millar Inquiry</field><field name="subject">Selective Service</field><field name="subject">National Service</field><field name="subject">Pentropic Division</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Particularities of the structural behaviour of reinforced high strength concrete slabs</field><field name="creator">Bliuc, Radu, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The introduction of high strength concrete in construction demanded an assessment of the current methods of structural design. In the case of the slabs, the benefits brought about by concretes of higher strength could translate into design of slender sections. Theoretically these sections could be prone to excessive deflections. The flexural behaviour of such structural elements should be carefully assessed. The present thesis addresses a series of particular issues such as deflection at service loads, crack formation and development of tension stiffening and ductility.  An experimental program on large-scale samples was conducted. Six one way and four two way slabs made of reinforced high strength concrete were tested under simulated and accurately measured equally distributed loads. Different loading stages were recorded. Crack formation, crack patterns and yield line disposition were observed. The main characteristics of concrete that influence the deflection behaviour were assessed based on collected data and on available literature results. Statistical methods were employed in order to refine empirical equations that help in the design of slabs. To improve the calculation of deflection of slabs a new equation for the effective moment of inertia was proposed. The new formula was integrated into a method of calculating deflection and verified against experimental results.  Limits of the use of high strength concrete in slabs were investigated by means of a parametric study. This was designed to answer some questions as: which would be the most important characteristics of high-strength concrete that influence the design and up to what value of strength would the beneficial effect on deflection exhaust its effectiveness. Models based on the refined empirical equations for different concrete parameters were proposed.  Another area that has been studied was the ductility of high strength concrete slabs. An analytical comparative study of the ductility of slabs reinforced with steel of different ductility class was conducted. Results were critically appraised and discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Beams</field><field name="subject">concrete</field><field name="subject">compression</field><field name="subject">crack</field><field name="subject">cracking</field><field name="subject">deflection</field><field name="subject">ductility</field><field name="subject">high strength</field><field name="subject">loads</field><field name="subject">reinforced</field><field name="subject">slabs</field><field name="subject">strain</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ignition enhancement for scramjet combustion</field><field name="creator">McGuire, Jeffrey Robert, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The process of shock-induced ignition has been investigated both computa- tionally and experimentally, with particular emphasis on the concept of radical farming. The first component of the investigation contained Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) calculations of an ignition delay study, a 2D pre-mixed flow over flat plate at a constant angle to the freestream, and through a generic 2D scramjet model. The focal point of the investigation however examined the complex 3D flow through a generic scramjet model. Five experimental test conditions were ex- amined over flow enthalpies from 3.4 MJ/kg to 6.4 MJ/kg. All test conditions simulated flight at 21000 metres ([symbol=almost equal to] 70000 ft), while the equivalent flight Mach number varied from approximately 8.5 at the lowest enthalpy, to approximately Mach 12 at the highest enthalpy condition. The presence of H2 fuel injected in the intake caused a separated region to form on the lower surface of the model at the entrance to the combustor. A fraction of the total mass of fuel was entrained in this separated region, providing long residence times, hence increased time for the chemical reactions that lead to ignition to occur. In addition, extremely high temperatures were found to exist between each fuel jet. Both fuel and air are present in these regions, therefore the chance of ignition in these regions is high. Streamlines passing through the recirculation zone ignited within this zone, while streamlines passing between the fuel jets ignited soon after entry into the combustor. The first instance of a pressure rise from combustion was observed on the centreline of the model where the reflected bow shock around the fuel jets crossed the centreline of the combus- tor. Upstream of this location the static pressure of the flow was too low for the chemical reactions that release heat to occur. The comparison between the experimental and computational results was lim- ited due to inaccuracies in modelling the thermal state of the gas in the CFD calculations. The gas was modelled as being in a state of thermal equilibrium at all times, which incorrectly models the freestream flow from the nozzle of the shock tunnel, and also the flow downstream of oblique shock wave within the scramjet model. As a result combustion occurs sooner in the CFD calculations than in the experimental result.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shock-induced ignition</field><field name="subject">2D scramjet model</field><field name="subject">radical farming</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamic (CFD) calculations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental management and the international competitiveness of nature-based tourism destinations : the case of Tropical North Queensland</field><field name="creator">Huybers, Twan, Economics &amp; Management, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The natural environment is a key attraction for Australia???s tourism industry.  In order to prevent the deterioration of the environment, environmental management measures have been adopted by the tourism industry.  Some of these measures are related to environmental regulations imposed on tourism operators by governments.  However, given the dependence of the nature-based tourism industry on the environment, voluntary environmental management measures have also been instituted.  The objective of this thesis is to investigate the effect of environmental management on the competitiveness of a nature-based tourism destination.  For that purpose, Tropical North Queensland, a major Australian nature-based destination, is selected as a case study.  Competitiveness is measured by the aggregate profitability of the tourism industry in the destination region.  The investigation incorporates an assessment of the simultaneous effects of environmental management on the destination???s tourism demand and on business costs to tourism operators at the destination.  The conceptual background to the investigations is discussed in the first part of the thesis.  It includes the rationale for choosing a nature-based destination region as the unit of analysis.  The conceptual framework is a departure from the conventional analysis of the relationship between the environment and international competitiveness in which the effect of regulatory compliance costs is emphasised.  In this thesis, the potential demand benefits and the associated voluntary environmental management are added to the conventional analytical framework.  The primary data for the analysis are derived from two separate investigations.  The first comprises an analysis of the tourism industry in Tropical North Queensland.  The second investigation involves a discrete choice modelling analysis of destination choices by prospective visitors to Tropical North Queensland.  The empirical results show that it is justified to treat the nature-based tourism destination region, Tropical North Queensland, as an aggregate entity in the analysis.  The destination competes as a collective unit with other destinations.  This is done, predominantly, on the basis of the region???s high-quality natural attractions.  The empirical analyses show that tourism businesses??? costs due to environmental management are small in comparison with the positive demand effects.  The cost and demand effects are assessed in a quantitative fashion in an economic model.  That analysis shows that environmental management makes a positive contribution to Tropical North Queensland???s competitiveness as a nature-based tourism destination.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural environment</field><field name="subject">Environmental management</field><field name="subject">Nature-based tourism</field><field name="subject">Destination competitiveness</field><field name="subject">Profitability</field><field name="subject">Regional cooperation</field><field name="subject">Tourism demand</field><field name="subject">Choice modelling</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Classification techniques for hyperspectral remote sensing image data</field><field name="creator">Jia, Xiuping, Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hyperspectral remote sensing image data, such as that recorded by AVIRIS with 224 spectral bands, provides rich information on ground cover types. However, it presents new problems in machine assisted interpretation, mainly in long processing times and the difficulties of class training due to the low ratio of number of training samples to the number of bands. This thesis investigates feasible and efficient feature reduction and image classification techniques which are appropriate for hyperspectral image data. The study is reported in three parts.  The first concerns a deterministic approach for hyperspectral data interpretation. Multigroup and multiple threshold spectral coding procedures, and associated techniques for spectral matching and classification, are proposed and tested. By coding on subgroups of bands using one or three thresholds, spectral searching and matching becomes simple, fast and free of the need for radiometric correction.  Modifications of existing statistical techniques are proposed in the second part of the investigation A block-based maximum likelihood classification technique is  developed. Several subgroups are formed from the complete set of spectral bands in the data, based on the properties of global correlation among the bands. Subgroups which are poorly correlated with each other are treated independently using conventional maximum likelihood classification. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using appropriate subgroup sizes, the new method provides a compromise among classification accuracy, processing time and available training pixels. Furthermore, a segmented, and possibly multi-layer, principal components transformation is proposed as a possible feature reduction technique prior to classification, and for effective colour display. The transformation is performed efficiently on each of the highly correlated subgroups of bands independently. Selected features from each transformed subgroup can be then transformed again to achieve a satisfactory data reduction ratio and to generate the three most significant components for colour display. Classification accuracy is improved and high quality colour image display is achieved in experiments using two AVIRIS data sets.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Remote sensing</field><field name="subject">hyperspectral</field><field name="subject">AVIRIS</field><field name="subject">spectral matching</field><field name="subject">maximum likelihood classification</field><field name="subject">principal components transformation</field><field name="subject">decision tree classifier</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representations of Japan and Japanese people in Australian literature</field><field name="creator">Kato, Megumi, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a broadly chronological study of representations of Japan and the Japanese in Australian novels, stories and memoirs from the late nineteenth century to the twenty-first century.  Adopting Edward Said???s Orientalist notion of the `Other???, it attempts to elaborate patterns in which Australian authors describe and evaluate the Japanese.  As well as examining these patterns of representation, this thesis outlines the course of their development and change over the years, how they relate to the context in which they occur, and how they contribute to the formation of wider Australian views on Japan and the Japanese.    The thesis considers the role of certain Australian authors in formulating images and ideas of the Japanese ???Other???.  These authors, ranging from fiction writers to journalists, scholars and war memoirists, act as observers, interpreters, translators, and sometimes ???traitors??? in their cross-cultural interactions.  The thesis includes work from within and outside ???mainstream??? writings, thus expanding the contexts of Australian literary history. The major ???periods??? of Australian literature discussed in this thesis include: the 1880s to World War II; the Pacific War; the post-war period; and the multicultural period (1980s to 2000).  While a comprehensive examination of available literature reveals the powerful and continuing influence of the Pacific War, images of ???the stranger???, ???the enemy??? and later ???the ally??? or ???partner??? are shown to vary according to authors, situations and wider international relations.     This thesis also examines gender issues, which are often brought into sharp relief in cross-cultural representations.  While typical East-West power-relationships are reflected in gender relations, more complex approaches are also taken by some authors.  This thesis argues that, while certain patterns recur, such as versions of the ???Cho-Cho-San??? or ???Madame Butterfly??? story, Japan-related works have given some Australian authors, especially women, opportunities to reveal more ???liberated??? viewpoints than seemed possible in their own cultural context.     As the first extensive study of Japan in Australian literary consciousness, this thesis brings to the surface many neglected texts.  It shows a pattern of changing interests and interactions between two nations whose economic interactions have usually been explored more deeply than their literary and cultural relations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Authors</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">Cowra</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">invasion novels</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">literary</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">memoirs</field><field name="subject">multicultural</field><field name="subject">Pacific War</field><field name="subject">post-war</field><field name="subject">short story</field><field name="subject">stories</field><field name="subject">World War II</field><field name="subject">Two</field><field name="subject">2</field><field name="subject">1939-1945</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life on the margins : the autobiographical fiction of Charles Bukowski</field><field name="creator">Bigna, Daniel, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Charles Bukowski devoted his writing career to turning his own life into poetry and prose. In poems and stories about his experiences as one of the working poor in post war America, and in those depicting his experiences as a writer of the American underground, Bukowski represents himself as both a literary and social outsider. Bukowski expresses an alternative literary aesthetic through his fictional persona, Henry Chinaski, who struggles to overcome his suffering in a world he finds absurd, and who embarks on a quest for freedom in his youth to which he remains committed all his life. This thesis examines Charles Bukowski's autobiographical fiction with a specific emphasis on five novels and one collection of short stories. In the novels, Post Office (1970), Factotum (1975), Women (1978), Ham on Rye (1982) and Hollywood (1989), and in a number of short stories in the collection Hot Water Music (1983), Bukowski explores different periods of Chinaski???s life with a dark humour, revealing links between Chinaski???s struggle with the absurd and those aspects comprising Bukowski???s alternative aesthetic. The thesis focuses on such aspects of Bukowski???s art as the uncommercial nature of his publishing history, his strong emphasis on literary simplicity, the appearance of the grotesque and Bukowski???s obsession with nonconformity, drinking and sex. These aspects illuminate the distinctive nature of Bukowski???s art and its purpose, which is the transformation of an ordinary life into literature.  This thesis argues that Bukowski illuminates possibilities that exist for individuals to create an identity for themselves through aesthetic self-expression. The thesis traces the development of Chinaski's non-conformist personality from Ham on Rye, based on Bukowski's youth in Los Angeles during the Depression, to Hollywood, Bukowski's ironic portrayal of Chinaski's brush with the commercial film industry. Through meeting the many challenges he faced throughout his life with defiance, honesty and an irreverent sense of humour, Bukowski invites readers to identify with his alternative world view. The thesis argues this particular aspect of his writing constitutes his most valuable contribution to twentieth century American fiction.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Charles Bukowski</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">criticism</field><field name="subject">aesthetic</field><field name="subject">novel</field><field name="subject">novels</field><field name="subject">literary. literature</field><field name="subject">non-conformist</field><field name="subject">Post Office</field><field name="subject">Factotum</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">ham on Rye</field><field name="subject">Hot Water Music</field><field name="subject">Hollywood</field><field name="subject">Henry Chinaski</field><field name="subject">autobiographical fiction</field><field name="subject">American</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speciation and chromosomal rearrangements in the Australian Morabine Grasshopper Vandiemenella viatica species group</field><field name="creator">Kawakami, Takeshi, Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Recent theoretical developments have led to a renewed interest in the potential role of chromosomal rearrangements in speciation. Australian morabine grasshoppers (genus Vandiemenella, viatica species group) provide an excellent study system to test this potential role, because they show extensive chromosomal variation: 12 chromosomal races/species with parapatric distributions. The research in this thesis involves the application of molecular genetic analyses to examine patterns of gene introgression among chromosomal races of Vandiemenella at three different spatial scales: local-scale hybrid zone analysis, island-scale phylogeography, and continental-scale phylogeography. The aims of these multi-scale analyses are to investigate whether chromosomal races represent genetically distinct taxa with limited gene flow, and to infer the historical biogeography of Vandiemenella and evolutionary origins of their parapatric distributions.  Karyotype and 11 nuclear markers revealed a remarkably narrow hybrid zone with substantial linkage disequilibrium and strong deficits of heterozygotes between the chromosome races P24(XY) and viatica17 on Kangaroo Island, suggesting that the zone is maintained by a balance between dispersal and selection against hybrids (tension zone). Selection that maintains the stable hybrid zone is unlikely to be operating only on loci linked to rearranged chromosomes. Island-scale and continental-scale phylogeography using multiple nuclear markers indicated that Vandiemenella chromosome races/species generally represent genetically distinct taxa with reduced gene flow between them. In contrast, analyses of a mitochondrial gene showed the presence of distinctive and geographically localised phylogroups that do not correspond with the distribution of the Vandiemenella taxa. These discordant population genetic patterns are likely to result from introgressive hybridization between the taxa and range expansions and contractions.  Overall, our molecular analyses favour the allopatric mode of diversification for the evolution of Vandiemenella and do not support the stasipatric speciation model of White (1978). Patterns of genetic differentiation between the chromosomal races analysed at three different spatial scales show dynamic responses of the grasshoppers to past climatic fluctuations, leading to opportunities for long-term isolation and allopatric fixation of new chromosome variants and molecular mutations at many loci. Further analyses are necessary to assess potential roles of chromosomal rearrangements in facilitating diversification in Vandiemenella by reducing recombination within the rearranged chromosome segments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian morabine grasshoppers</field><field name="subject">chromosomal rearrangement</field><field name="subject">polymorphic microsatellite markers</field><field name="subject">Vandiemenella viatica</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forensic speaker analysis and identification by computer : a Bayesian approach anchored in the cepstral domain</field><field name="creator">Khodai-Joopari, Mehrdad, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis advances understanding of the forensic value of the automatic speech parameters by addressing the following question: what is the potentiality of the speech cepstrum as a forensic-acoustic parameter?  Despite many advances in automatic speech and speaker recognition, robust and unconstrained progress in technical forensic speaker identification has been partly impeded by our incomplete understanding of the interaction and relation between forensic phonetics and the techniques employed in state-of-the-art automatic speech and speaker recognition. The posed question underlies the recurrent and longstanding issue of acoustic parameterisation in the area of forensic phonetics, where 1) speaker identification often must be carried out under less than optimal conditions, and 2) views differ on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the formant frequency measurements.  To this end, a new formulation for the forensic evaluation of speech data was derived which is effectively a spectral likelihood ratio with enhanced sensitivity to the local peaks of the formant structure of the speech spectrum of vowel sounds, while retaining the characteristics of the Bayesian framework. This new hybrid formula was used together with a novel approach, which is founded on a statistically-based matched-pairs technique to account for various levels of variation inherent in speech recordings, thereby providing a spectrally meaningful measure of variations between two speech spectra and hence the true worth of speech samples as forensic evidence. The experimental results are obtained based on a forensically-realistic database of a relatively large population of 297 native speakers of Japanese.  In sum, the research conducted in this thesis is a major step forward in advancing the forensic-phonetic field which broadens the objective basis of the forensic speaker identification. Beyond advancing knowledge in the field, the semi data-independent nature of the new formula ultimately has great implications in technical forensic speaker identification. It also provides us with a valuable biometric tool with both academic and commercial potential in crime investigation in a field which is already suffering from the lack of adequate data.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Speech</field><field name="subject">speaker identification</field><field name="subject">forensic phonetics</field><field name="subject">automatic speech recognition</field><field name="subject">cepstral parameterisation</field><field name="subject">Bayesian statistical decision theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The conjunctive use of bonded repairs and crack growth retardation techniques</field><field name="creator">Kieboom, Orio Terry,  Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">In an attempt to find a way of improving the damage tolerance of composite bonded repairs to metallic aircraft structures, the effect of using conventional crack growth retardation techniques in conjunction with bonded repairs was experimentally investigated.  Hence, an experimental test program was set up to determine whether fatigue crack growth under bonded repairs is retarded further by giving the crack to be repaired a crack growth retardation treatment prior to repair patch application. In addition, it was set up to determine the influence of a bonded repair on the effectiveness of a crack growth retardation method. Centrally cracked aluminium plates were used. Stop drilling followed by cold hole expansion and the application of single overloads were selected as retardation treatments. Two patch materials were considered; boron/epoxy and Glare 2. Further test variables were the aluminium alloy and the plate thickness.  Fatigue testing was carried out under constant amplitude loading and baseline results were determined first. In addition to optically monitoring the crack growth, local and global out-of-plane deformations were visualised with holographic interferometry and shadow moire??. Furthermore, the stress intensity factors under the repair patch were examined with strain gauges and measurement of the central crack opening displacement. Disbonds and fracture surfaces were studied after residual strength tests.  The crack growth results obtained showed that retardation treatments decrease crack growth rates under a repair patch and that the effectiveness of a retardation treatment is increased by the patch. Although identical crack growth rates were observed under boron/epoxy and Glare 2 patches, the reinitiation period after the retardation treatment lasted longer when Glare 2 patches were applied. Analytical predictions of the extent of retardation based on existing models showed that the conjunctive effect of retardation treatments and bonded repairs was underestimated. A sustained reduction in crack growth rates was observed under bonded repairs with a prior overload retardation treatment.  It was concluded that the damage tolerance of bonded repairs is increased by the application of a crack growth retardation treatment because the crack growth is retarded further. These findings indicate that the range of cracks in aircraft for which bonded repairs can be considered is expanded and that economic benefits can be obtained.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Airframes</field><field name="subject">fatigue crack growth</field><field name="subject">cracking</field><field name="subject">repair patch</field><field name="subject">bonded repair</field><field name="subject">aluminium plates</field><field name="subject">crack growth retardation treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The political consequences of military operations in Indonesia 1945-99 : a fieldwork analysis of the political power-diffusion effects of guerilla conflict</field><field name="creator">Kilcullen, David J., Politics, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Problem Investigated. This dissertation is a study of the political effects of low-intensity warfare in Indonesia since 1945. In particular, it examines the interaction between general principles and contextual variables in guerrilla conflict, to determine whether such conflict causes the diffusion of political power.  Analysis of insurgent movements indicates that power structures within a guerrilla group tend to be regionalised, diffuse and based on multiple centres of roughly equal authority. Conversely, studies of counter-insurgency (COIN) techniques indicate that successful COIN depends on effective political control over the local population. This tends to be exercised by regional or local military commanders rather than by central authority. Based on this, the author???s initial analysis indicated that one should expect to see a diffusion of political authority from central leaders (whether civilian or military) to regional military leaders, when a society is engaged in the conduct of either COIN or guerrilla warfare.  The problem investigated in this dissertation can therefore be stated thus:  To what extent, at which levels of analysis and subject to what influencing factors does low-intensity warfare in Indonesia between 1945 and 1999 demonstrate a political power-diffusion effect?  Procedures Followed. The procedure followed was a diachronic, qualitative, fieldwork-based analysis of two principle case studies:  the Darul Islam insurgency in West Java 1948-1962 and the campaign in East Timor 1974-1999. Principle research tools were:  ???	Semi-structured, formal, informal and group interviews.  ???	Analysis of official and private archives in Australia, Indonesia, the Netherlands and the UK.  ???	Participant observation using anthropological fieldwork techniques.  ???	Geographical analysis using transects, basemapping and overhead imagery.  ???	Demographic analysis using historical data, cartographic records and surveys.  Research was conducted in Australia, Indonesia (Jakarta and Bandung), the Netherlands (The Hague and Amsterdam) and the United Kingdom (London, Winchester, Salisbury and Warminster). Fieldwork was conducted over three periods in West Java (1994, 1995 and 1996) and one period in East Timor (1999-2000).  General Results Obtained. The two principal case studies were the Darul Islam insurgency in West Java 1948-62 and the campaign in East Timor since 1974.  The fieldwork data showed that low-intensity warfare in Indonesia between 1945 and 1999 did indeed demonstrate the political power-diffusion effect posited by the author. This effect was triggered by the outbreak of guerrilla warfare, which itself flowed from crises generated by processes of modernisation and change within Indonesian society from traditional hierarchies to modern forms of social organisation. These crises were also affected by events at the systemic and regional levels of analysis ??? the invasion of the Netherlands East Indies by Japan, the Cold War, the Asian financial crisis and increasing economic and media globalisation. They resulted in a breakdown or weakening of formal power structures, allowing informal power structures to dominate. This in turn allowed local elites with economic, social or religious influence and with coercive power over the population, to develop political and military power at the local level while being subject to little control from higher levels. This process, then, represented a power diffusion from central and civilian leadership levels to local leaders with coercive means ??? most often military or insurgent leaders.  Having been triggered by guerrilla operations, however, the direction and process by which such power diffusion operated was heavily influenced by contextual variables, of which the most important were geographical factors, political culture, traditional authority structures and the interaction of external variables at different levels of analysis. Topographical isolation, poor infrastructure, severe terrain, scattered population groupings and strong influence by traditional hierarchies tend to accelerate and exacerbate the loss of central control. Conversely good infrastructure, large population centres, good communications and a high degree of influence by nation-state and systemic levels of analysis ??? particularly through economic and governmental institutionalisation ??? tend to slow such diffusion. Moreover, while power may be diffusing at one level of analysis (e.g. nation-state) it may be centralising at another (e.g. into the hands of military leaders at local level).  Analysis of the Malayan Emergency indicates that, in a comparable non-Indonesian historical example, the same general tendency to political power diffusion was evident and that the same broad contextual variables mediated it. However, it would be premature to conclude that the process observed in Indonesia is generally applicable. The nature and relative importance of contextual factors is likely to vary between examples and hence additional research on non-Indonesian examples would be necessary before such a conclusion could be drawn. Further research on a current instance of guerrilla operations in Indonesia is also essential before the broader contemporary applicability of these findings can be reliably demonstrated.  Major Conclusions Reached. Based on the above, the theses developed to answer the initial problem can be stated thus:  The command and control (C2) structures inherent in traditional, dispersed rural guerrilla movements that lack access to mass media or electronic communications tend to lessen the degree of control by central (military or political) leaders over regional leaders.  If COIN or Internal Security Operations are conducted, two factors will operate. First, there will be an increase in the degree of control over the civil population by local military leaders, at the expense of local or central political leaders. Second, where military command structures are pyramidal or segmentary, there will be an increase in control by local commanders at the expense of central military leaders. Where the central government is civilian or has interests divergent from the military???s, the first of these factors will dominate. Where the government is military or has interests largely identical to those of the military, the second factor will be dominant.  The process of power diffusion can thus be summarised as follows:  A crisis driven by processes of societal change or by external causes, leads to the outbreak of violence, one facet of which may include guerrilla operations. If guerrilla operations do occur, the C2 structures inherent in such operations give a high degree of autonomy and independence to local military leaders.  The same (or a contemporaneous) crisis produces a breakdown of formal power structures, causing organisations to fall back upon informal power structures.  The nature of these informal power structures is determined by geography, political culture, patterns of traditional authority within the society and the degree of interaction of systemic/regional factors with local events.  Thus the guerrilla operations and the concomitant breakdown in formal power structures form the trigger for political power diffusion. The precise nature and progress of this diffusion is then determined by contextual variables.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Low-intensity conflicts (Military science)</field><field name="subject">Civil-military relations</field><field name="subject">Guerrilla warfare</field><field name="subject">Insurgency</field><field name="subject">counter-insurgency</field><field name="subject">West Java</field><field name="subject">East Timor</field><field name="subject">political power</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">Darul Islam</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early developments in the literature of Australian natural history : together with a select bibliography of Australian natural history writing, printed in English, from 1697 to the present</field><field name="creator">Drayson, Nick, English, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Early nineteenth-century Eurocentric perceptions of natural history led to the flora and fauna of Australia being thought of as deficient and inferior compared with those of other lands. By the 1820s, Australia had become known as ???the land of contrarieties???. This, and Eurocentric attitudes to nature in general, influenced the expectations and perceptions of immigrants throughout the century. Yet at the same time there was developing an aesthetic appreciation of the natural history of Australia. This thesis examines the tension between these two perceptions in the popular natural history writing of the nineteenth century, mainly through the  writing of five authors ??? George Bennett (1804-1893), Louisa Anne Meredith (1812-1895), Samuel Hannaford (1937-1874), Horace Wheelwright (1815-1865) and Donald Macdonald (1859?-1932). George Bennett was a scientist, who saw Australian plants and animals more as scientific specimens than objects of beauty. Louisa Meredith perceived them in the familiar language of English romantic poetry. Samuel Hannaford used another language, that of popular British natural history writers of the mid-nineteenth century. To Horace Wheelwright, Australian animals were equally valuable to the sportsman???s gun as to the naturalist???s pen. Donald Macdonald was the only one of these major writers to have been born in Australia. Although proud of his British heritage, he rejoiced in the beauty of his native land. His writing demonstrates his joy, and his novel attitude to Australian natural history continued and developed in the present century.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Meredith</field><field name="subject">Louisa Anne</field><field name="subject">Hannaford</field><field name="subject">Samuel</field><field name="subject">Wheelwright</field><field name="subject">Horace William</field><field name="subject">Macdonald</field><field name="subject">Donald</field><field name="subject">natural history literature</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">fauna</field><field name="subject">flora</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38674</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Raicakacaka : 'walking the road' from colonial to post-colonial mission : the life, work and thought of the Reverend Dr. Alan Richard Tippett, Methodist missionary in Fiji, anthropologist and missiologist, 1911-1988</field><field name="creator">Dundon, Colin George, History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis contributes to the literature on the history of the transition from colonial to post-colonial in the Pacific. It explores the contribution of an individual to this transition, Rev. Dr. Alan Richard Tippett, as a focus for illuminating the struggles in the transitions and the development of post-colonial theory for mission.  Alan Richard Tippet sailed to Fiji as an ordained Methodist missionary in 1941. He was a product of a Methodist parsonage and heir to the evangelical and revival tendencies of the Cornish Methodism of his family. He began his missionary career steeped in the colonial visions of the mission enterprise fostered by the Board of Missions of his church. He was eager to study anthropology but was given no chance to do so before he left Australia.  He pursued his study of anthropology and history in Fiji and began to question the paternalism of colonial theory. Early in his time in Fiji he made the decision to join with those who sought change and the death of colonial mission. In his work as a circuit minister, theological educator, writer and administrator he worked to this end. He developed his talent for writing and research, encouraging the Fijian church to take pride in its past achievements. He became alienated from the administrators of the Australasian Methodist Board of Missions and could find no place in the Australian church.  In 1961 he left Fiji and began a course of study at the newly formed Institute of Church Growth in Eugene, Oregon. This led him into the orbit of Donald McGavran and the newly emerging church growth theory of Christian mission. Although his desire was to enhance the study of post-colonial mission in Australia he could not find a position to support him even after he gained a PhD in anthropology from the University of Oregon. After research in the Solomon Islands he returned to the USA to assist Donald McGavran in the formation of the now famous School of World Mission at Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena.  While at Fuller he exercised considerable influence in the development of missiological theory and especially the application of anthropological studies in post-colonial mission. Although he contributed to both the ecumenical and evangelical debates on mission, he found himself caught up in the bitter debates of the 1960s and 1970s between them and, despite all efforts to maintain links, lost contact with the ecumenical wing.  Retiring to Australia in 1977 he found that his world reputation was not recognised in his native land. He continued his work apace, although he was deeply saddened by the ignorance he found in Australia and by his continued rejection. He finally donated his library to St. Mark???s National Theological Centre. He died in 1988 in Canberra.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alan Richard Tippett</field><field name="subject">anthropology</field><field name="subject">biography</field><field name="subject">Christian</field><field name="subject">colonial</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural</field><field name="subject">Donald McGavran</field><field name="subject">ecumenical</field><field name="subject">ethnohistory</field><field name="subject">evangelical</field><field name="subject">faith</field><field name="subject">Fiji</field><field name="subject">Fijian</field><field name="subject">Fuller Theological Seminary</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Institute of Church Growth</field><field name="subject">Methodism</field><field name="subject">Methodist Church</field><field name="subject">ministry</field><field name="subject">missiologist</field><field name="subject">mission</field><field name="subject">missions</field><field name="subject">missionary</field><field name="subject">post-colonial</field><field name="subject">Pacific</field><field name="subject">School of World Mission</field><field name="subject">Suva</field><field name="subject">theologians</field><field name="subject">theology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38694</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Half the battle : the administration and higher organisation of the AIF 1914-1918</field><field name="creator">Faraday, Bruce Douglas, History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Administration of armies has been sadly neglected in historical studies but the ability of the AIF to develop an efficient system of administration and to fit into the equally efficient British system, had much to do with the success of  the AIF, especially late in the war.

It examines the manner in which the AIF developed a  system and the many facets of this system, which had developed a remarkable degree of efficiency by the end of the war.

This enigmatic source has previously been proposed to be the first in a new class of super-slow X-ray pulsars, containing a neutron star revolving once every 2.7 h. The 11.6 d orbital period of this system has been well established in both X-ray and optical wavelengths. During the initial stages of the research presented in this thesis we discovered an additional 30.7 d ???super-orbital??? modulation in the X-ray emission from this source. While similar periodicities seen in other X-ray binaries are commonly attributed to the precession of a warped accretion disc, the observational evidence suggests the absence of such a disc in 2S 0114+650. The purpose of this project is thus to determine the nature of the super-orbital modulation and to better constrain the astrophysical parameters of this system.    To investigate the long-term variability we analysed ~8.5 yr of archived data from  the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer space telescope. The problem of the spurious ~24 h periods in this data was solved as a by-product of these studies. Follow-up pointed observations were obtained with this satellite in order to examine the spectral and temporal behaviour over the spin, orbital and super-orbital timescales. Independent confirmation of the super-orbital modulation was performed using ~2 yr of data from the INTEGRAL satellite obtained during a long-term monitoring campaign of the Cassiopeia region. The evolution of the spin, orbital and super-orbital periods over ~10 yr was examined using archived data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite. Radio observations were performed with the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope to search for any radio emission associated with this source and to determine whether it is variable over the known periodicities. Near infrared observations were performed with the Mt Abu telescope to determine whether a Be star nature can be ruled out for the optical component. Finally, a statistical analysis of the properties of the confirmed super-orbital X-ray binaries was performed in order to search for commonalities between these systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">X-ray astronomy</field><field name="subject">X-ray binaries</field><field name="subject">pulsars</field><field name="subject">Rossi x-ray timing explorer</field><field name="subject">spectral leakage</field><field name="subject">RXTE PCA &amp; HEXTE observations</field><field name="subject">2S 0114+650</field><field name="subject">near infrared observations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38692</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Where fate calls : the HMAS Voyager tragedy</field><field name="creator">Frame, Thomas Robert, History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">On 10 February 1964 during naval night exercises off the south coast of Australia, the destroyer HMAS Voyager was lost after colliding with the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne. 82 men were killed. Following the collision, there  were two Royal Commissions that sustained a political controversy that lasted for over four years. This thesis examines the loss of Voyager as a watershed in the operational and administrative history of the RAN and as a major event in Australian national history. This study has four broad objectives: to describe the loss of Voyager and the long running controversy that accompanied the disaster; to offer a convincing explanation of the causes of the collision and why two royal commissions concluded that the causes for the disaster were inexplicable; to assess the effect on the RAN, in terms of specific reforms and its influence on Service culture and professional ethos, of the disaster and the inquiries that followed; and finally, to analyse the loss of Voyager as a media and political cause celebre in Australian history. As so little has been written about Voyager using primary sources, this thesis was committed to detailed description of events as well as analysis of themes. This thesis draws upon an extensive body of primary source material in the form of official naval and Royal Commission records to which complete access was given; several large collections of private papers; over one hundred interviews with principal participants; and comprehensive files of press cuttings. The discussion seeks to demonstrate that a series of naval accidents preceding the loss of Voyager contributed in a substantial way to shaping the public reaction to, and political handling of, the disaster; that the method of inquiry played a major role in generating public and political disquiet; that the collision was both a catalyst and stimulus to change in naval operations and reform in naval administration; that the inability of two Royal Commissions to ascertain the causes of the collision and then to public suspicion of a cover-up; and, that the collision was most probably caused by the incorrect relaying of a tactical signal on the bridge of Voyager. The loss of HMAS Voyager appears to be a key event in the development of the RAN, not as a direct result of the collision or its causes, but as a consequence of its long and controversial aftermath.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HMAS Voyager</field><field name="subject">HMAS Melbourne</field><field name="subject">Royal Australian Navy</field><field name="subject">RAN</field><field name="subject">Voyager Royal Commision</field><field name="subject">Spicer Report</field><field name="subject">Burbury Report</field><field name="subject">Captain John Robertson</field><field name="subject">Captain Duncan Stevens</field><field name="subject">collision at sea</field><field name="subject">naval administration</field><field name="subject">naval operations</field><field name="subject">Australian Commonwealth Navy Board</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visualisation techniques for the computer simulation of bushfires in two dimensions</field><field name="creator">French, Ian, Dept. of Computer Science, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines techniques that provide a method of computer visualisation of bushfire spread. Existing techniques studied include, Kourtz &amp; O???Regan, Green???s Contact, Heat Accumulation, Percolation modelling and Huygens??? Principle by Anderson et.al., French, Roberts, Richards. Many of these techniques are extended as part of a comprehensive study into how they perform in a two dimensional reference frame (ie over flat terrain only). New techniques are defined for Percolation Modelling and Huygens??? Principle.  Each technique is examined in a series of test cases which include computer simulations with no wind, constant wind, variable wind, variable vegetation (including patchy fuel and two fuels) and where fuel burns out. These test cases provide: (a) an incremental approach to understanding the operation of each technique; (b) a basis for comparison; and (c) verification of correctness of the technique in two dimensions.  Several of the techniques are shown, by these test cases, to be equivalent. For instance, the Kourtz &amp; O???Regan technique using a square template is equivalent to the Contact Technique, Site percolation is similar to the Heat Accumulation technique and Template percolation is similar to the Contact Technique. Overall the Huygens???

Decisions based on a predominately heuristic (rule of thumb) approach to design have had many adverse consequences for the integrity of the proximity warning function. A sound mathematical model is required to establish this function on a mature engineering foundation. To achieve this, the proximity warning function has been investigated as a hybrid-system. This approach recognises the dual nature of the design: that aircraft dynamics give rise to continuous mathematical models while the communication protocols controlling proximity require discrete mathematical approaches. The blending of each aspect has yielded a deeper insight into the operational limitations and failure modes of this function. The presentation of the thesis follows a design thread through the function. It begins with a description of existing standards and implementations. Risk models are then developed. The pilot interface is recognised as a primary design constraint. Mathematical models are then developed to describe the topology of flow, proximity dynamics, and the scheduling constraints associated with visual, voice, and data-link communications required by the proximity warning function. These analyses show that many aspects of design can be bounded by analytical formulae that bring new robustness to the design and resolve some of the misconceptions arising from the often inaccurate perceptions of present airspace operations. Failure modes, unaccounted for in existing designs are found to actually aggravate failure in the very situations in which the airspace design should be robust and should act to prevent collisions. In particular, there are divergences of performance between the demands required by the system design and the ability of the pilot to deliver such performances. In some cases, these failures may be traced to policy decisions such as service between Instrument Flight Rule and Visual Flight Rule category aircraft. On the basis of the conclusions of this research, a formal engineering review of the proximity warning function is required to assure the containment of the likelihood of mid-air collision for all future operations.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aeroplanes; aircraft proximity; airplanes; airspace; communication; collision risk;  data link; flight-path dynamics;  instrument flight rule;  managed; mathematical models; mid-air collision; pilot-to-pilot; proximity; regional Australia; safety; unmanaged; visual flight rule;  visual communication; voice link communication; warning systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local-global coupling in strategy games: extracting signatures and unfolding dynamics</field><field name="creator">Ghoneim, Ayman Ahmed Sabry Abdel Rahman, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Complexity underlying life is largely governed by the dynamics of interaction within and between living and nonliving entities. Evolutionary strategy games are extensively used in modelling and understanding complex behaviors in a wide range of fields including theoretical biology, social interactions, economics, politics, defense and security. Strategy games are said to distill the key elements of interactions be- tween real-world entities and organizations - one of the challenges lies in determining the mapping of complex real life situation dynamics to that of a certain game. That leads us to the two major research questions outlined below. In this thesis, we are taking evolutionary games a step further to investigate the interplay between local and global dynamics, where local dynamics are repre- sented by locally pairwise interactions among the population's players governed by the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game. To represent the global dynamics, two main modelling ideas are proposed, in the first model; a mixed evolutionary game is in- troduced where players are competing globally on the population level in a minority game. The interplay between local and global dynamics in this model represents the interplay between different scopes of competition between the same players. Sec- ondly, we introduce a model for studying the effect of sharing global information concerning a population of players, shedding light on how global information can alter the emerging dynamics of local interactions. Furthermore, the thesis addresses the question of whether games - with different dynamics - have unique signatures (footprints) that can be used in recognizing and differentiating among them, and whether these footprints are consistent along the evolutionary path of these games. We show here that by building winning networks between players, and determining network motifs of these winning networks, we can obtain motifs' counts signals that are sufficient to categorize and recognize the game's utility matrix used by the players. We also demonstrate that these footprints - motifs' counts - are consistent along the evolutionary path of the games, due to a hyper-cyclic behavior that exists between strategies. Finally, we show that this approach is capable of identifying whether a certain population is driven by local dynamics or both local and global dynamics using the proposed mixed game.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Game Theory</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary Game Theory</field><field name="subject">Local and Global Dynamics</field><field name="subject">2 x 2 Games</field><field name="subject">Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma</field><field name="subject">Minority Game</field><field name="subject">Mixed Games</field><field name="subject">Information Sharing</field><field name="subject">Game Dynamics</field><field name="subject">Games' Winning Networks</field><field name="subject">Network Motifs</field><field name="subject">Co-evolutionary Genetic Algorithm</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outback or at home? : environment, social change and pastoralism in Central Australia</field><field name="creator">Gill, Nicholas, Geography &amp; Oceanography, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the responses of non-indigenous pastoralists in Central Australian rangelands to two social movements that profoundly challenge their occupancy, use and management of land. Contemporary environmentalism and Aboriginal land rights have both challenged the status of pastoralists as valued primary producers and bearers of a worthy pioneer heritage. Instead, pastoralists have become associated with land degradation, biodiversity loss, and Aboriginal dispossession. Such pressure has intensified in the 1990s in the wake of the native Title debate, and various conservation campaigns in the arid and semi-arid rangelands.  The pressure on pastoralists occur in the context of wider reassessment of the social and economic values or rangelands in which pastoralism is seen as having declined in value compared to ???post-production??? land uses. Reassessments of rangelands in turn are part of the global changes in the status of rural areas, and of the growing flexibility in the very meaning of ???rural???.  Through ethnographic fieldwork among largely non-indigenous pastoralists in Central Australia, this thesis investigates the nature and foundations of pastoralists??? responses to these changes and critiques. Through memory, history, labour and experience of land, non-indigenous pastoralists construct a narrative of land, themselves and others in which the presence of pastoralism in Central Australia is naturalised, and Central Australia is narrated as an inherently pastoral landscape. Particular types of environmental knowledge and experience, based in actual environmental events and processes form the foundation for a discourse of pastoral property rights. Pastoralists accommodate environmental concerns, through advocating environmental stewardship. They do this in such a way that Central Australia is maintained as a singularly pastoral landscape, and one in which a European, or ???white???, frame of reference continues to dominate. In this way the domesticated pastoral landscapes of colonialism and nationalism are reproduced.  The thesis also examines Aboriginal pastoralism as a distinctive form of pastoralism, which fulfils distinctly Aboriginal land use and cultural aspirations, and undermines the conventional meaning of ???pastoralism??? itself.  The thesis ends by suggesting that improved dialogue over rangelands futures depends on greater understanding of the details and complexities of local relationships between groups of people, and between people and land.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal land rights</field><field name="subject">pastoralists</field><field name="subject">pastoralism</field><field name="subject">pastoral settlement</field><field name="subject">land use</field><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="subject">Central Australia</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">environmentalism</field><field name="subject">mythic landscapes</field><field name="subject">cultural politics</field><field name="subject">colonialism</field><field name="subject">soil conservation</field><field name="subject">non-indigenous</field><field name="subject">indigenous</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">cattle</field><field name="subject">landcare</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">outback</field><field name="subject">variability</field><field name="subject">rangelands</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of social network properties on the impact of direct contact epidemics</field><field name="creator">Badham, Jennifer Marette, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Epidemiological models are used to inform health policy on issues such as target vaccination levels, comparing quarantine options and estimating the eventual size of an epidemic. Models that incorporate some elements of the social network structure are used for diseases where close contact is required for transmission.  The motivation of this research is to extend epidemic models to include the relationship with a broader set of relevant real world network properties. The impact of degree distribution by itself is reasonably well understood, but studies with assortativity or clustering are limited and none examine their interaction.  To evaluate the impact of these properties, I simulate epidemics on networks with a range of property values. However, a suitable algorithm to generate the networks is not available in the literature. There are thus two research aspects: generating networks with relevant properties, and estimating the impact of social network structure on epidemic behaviour.  Firstly, I introduce a flexible network generation algorithm that can independently control degree distribution, clustering coefficient and degree assortativity. Results show that the algorithm is able to generate networks with properties that are close to those targeted.  Secondly, I fit models that account for the relationship between network properties and epidemic behaviour. Using results from a large number of epidemic simulations over networks with a range of properties, regression models are fitted to estimate the separate and joint effect of the identified social network properties on the probability of an epidemic occurring and the basic reproduction ratio. The latter is a key epidemic parameter that represents the number of people infected by a typical initial infected person in a population.  Results show that social network properties have a significant influence on epidemic behaviour within the property space investigated. Ignoring the differences between social networks can lead to substantial errors when estimating the basic reproduction ratio from an epidemic and then applying the estimate to a different social network. In turn, these errors could lead to failure in public health programs that rely on such estimates.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">epidemic modelling</field><field name="subject">social network theory</field><field name="subject">network generation algorithms</field><field name="subject">epidemic simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extended macroscopic dispersion model with applications to confined packed beds and capillary column inverse gas chromatography</field><field name="creator">Hamdan, Emad, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Until present, many researchers relied on the conventional plug flow dispersion models to analyse the concentration profiles obtained from the tracer injection experiments to evaluate the dispersion coefficients in packed beds. The Fickian concept in the limit of long time duration is assumed to be applicable and it implies that the mean-square displacement of the tracer profile is constant with time and the concentration profile is Gaussian. There were very few studies on identifying the conditions under which this assumption is valid and delineate the range of applicability of the existing plug flow dispersion models. If the time scales of a tracer injection experiment are not sufficient for a tracer to traverse the bed radius and sample the velocity variations, this could give rise to persisting non-Fickian transients where the mean-square displacement of the tracer profile is not constant with time and the concentration profile deviates from the normal Gaussian distribution. These transients cannot be predicted by the conventional plug dispersion models. An extended axial non-Fickian macroscopic dispersion model is derived to describe the transient development of a solute tracer when injected into a fluid flowing through a cylindrical packed bed or empty tube and some non-Fickian effects in the dispersion process. The flow profile in beds packed with uniform particles exhibits radial non-uniformity due to the oscillatory variation in porosity because of the wall confinement (wall effect). Compared with the axial plug flow dispersion model, the extended model contains time-dependent coefficients such as the transient axial dispersion coefficient and higher order derivatives (higher than second order) of the cross-sectionally averaged concentration. Including them provides some insight on non-Fickian transport in the dispersion process. The model provides time criteria on the basis that the effelongitudinal dispersion coefficient in the packed bed reaches its asymptotic value and the non-Fickian transients will die out. Some experimental conditions in the literature were checked by these criteria and found to be either marginally satisfied, or not satisfied at all, which indicates that the Fickian concept is not valid. The model results for tracer dispersion in cylindrical packed beds show that the longitudinal dispersion coefficient converges to its asymptotic value on a time scale proportional to R2/(DT) where R is the column radius and (DT) is the area averaged lateral dispersion coefficient. The extended model encouraged study of the consequences of the additional dispersion terms in other applications such as the pulse spread in the field of capillary column inverse gas chromatography (CCIGC). CCIGC is used to evaluate the solute-polymer diffusion coefficient Dp and the partition coefficient K at infinite dilute conditions. The tube geometry in CCIGC is more complex than the conventional Taylor dispersion problem due to the polymer coating on the inside of the capillary wall. The extended CCIGC model presented in this study has advantages over the previous models by including the effects of Taylor dispersion and higher order derivatives of the pulse area-averaged concentration. Taylor dispersion effect causes more pulse spread in the longitudinal direction and by not including it in the CCIGC regression models may cause a significant error in the measured Dp values. The extended CCIGC model provides for the first time criteria on capillary dimensions for the transient coefficients (multiplying the second and higher order derivatives) to become constant and for the non-Fickian effects associated with the higher order derivatives to be neglected. Model results show that Taylor dispersion effect has a significant effect on the elution profiles at high values of Dp  and/or low values of gas diffusion coefficients Dg and it can be used to increase the sensitivity range of the previous CCIGC models at extremely low and high Dp values.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Non-Fickian macroscopic dispersion model</field><field name="subject">capillary column inverse gas chromatography</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eco-sedimentological environments of an inter-tidal reef platform, Warraber Island, Torres Strait</field><field name="creator">Hart, Deirdre E., Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines functional relationships between the morphologic, hydrodynamic, ecological and sedimentological characteristics of the Warraber reef platform, an inter-tidal reef island system, Central Torres Strait, Australia (10[degrees] 12??? S, 142 [degrees] 49??? E).  Hydrodynamic and sediment-transport experiments were conducted on the reef flat using current meters, water level recorders and directional sediment traps. Results showed dominantly SE flows during the dry season and more variable NW to SE flows during the wet season. Topography and reefal water levels modulated the direction and strength of currents and the generation of wind-waves on the reef flat as well as the passage of waves over the reef rim. These hydrodynamic conditions are sufficient to induce significant transport of moderately fast to slow settling sediment (&amp;gt-5.25 symbol psi) on the reef flat, though the platform as a whole is a relatively closed transport system.  Carbonate production was estimated based on the key ecological variables of live assemblage distribution and cover. Overall, only 24% of the reef flat was occupied by carbonate-producing organisms. The average estimated carbonate-production rate for the reef was 1.6 kgm -2y-1 (0.07-4.37 kgm-2y-1). Production is dominated by coral (73%), with subordinate proportions contributed by coralline algae (19%). And molluscs, foraminifera and Halimeda (&amp;lt4%) though actual reef-flat sediments did not reflect this potential. Instead, they were dominated by molluscs (35-55%), coralline algae (16-26%), coral (8-13%), Halimeda (7-8%) and foraminifera (5-10%). Differential rates of carbonate to sediment conversion meant the reef-platform sediments were more closely related to the cover of live organisms than to the contribution of carbonate production by each parent organism.  The settling properties of the least altered particles of the five commonest constituents were measured and these provided the basis for an eco-sedimentological model of the reef-platform system. Modelled textures were compared to the actual textures, indicating the degree of textural alteration resulting from a combination of biological and physical processes, including sediment production, hydraulic sorting and mechanical breakdown. This analysis, integrated with the hydrodynamic, exposure and other data, was used to determine reef-platform surface-sediment sources, sinks and transport pathways.  In using both the textual and constituent compositional properties of sediments, as well as information on local biological and physical processes, the model approach developed offers progress towards an integrative, interdisciplinary analysis of carbonate environments.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Warraber Island</field><field name="subject">Torres Strait</field><field name="subject">sediments</field><field name="subject">sedimentation</field><field name="subject">reef environments</field><field name="subject">ecosystem</field><field name="subject">beach morphology</field><field name="subject">reef flat</field><field name="subject">tidal</field><field name="subject">hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">currents</field><field name="subject">waves</field><field name="subject">carbonate production</field><field name="subject">eco-sedimentology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ten years at the top : an analysis of the role of Air Marshal Sir George Jones as Chief of the Air Staff, Royal Australian Air Force, 1942-1952</field><field name="creator">Helson, Peter,  Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis sets out to examine the proposition that Air Marshal Sir George Jones??? time as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) of the Royal Australian Air force (RAAF) was both beneficial and detrimental to the Service but the benefits gained from his time in office outweighed the detriment. Sir George Jones served as CAS for nearly ten years (1942 - 1952). This was the longest continuous appointment of a CAS to date. Jones was CAS for most of the Second World War and it was during that time that the two events for which he is most remembered occurred, viz the controversy surrounding his appointment and his ongoing conflict with the RAAF Operational Commander (W.D. Bostock). In order to assess his impact on the RAAF, this thesis describes events and incidents that occurred while Jones was CAS. To compile this work, data was drawn from numerous sources including: interviews with family members and ex-RAAF personnel; official records maintained by the National Archives of Australia (NAA), the RAAF Historical Section and the RAAF Museum; Jones??? personal papers held by family members and the Australian War Memorial; and the papers of other RAAF officers and politicians held by the RAAF Museum and the National Library of Australia (NLA). Jones wrote a brief autobiography, which (together with other secondary sources) was used to ???fill in the gaps.??? This research shows that Jones??? time as CAS was far more eventful and filled with more conflict than he alludes to in his autobiography. He had no say in his appointment as CAS but his personality did not allow him to make the best of the situation with Bostock. Contrary to the views expressed in earlier works, Jones??? appointment was not a mistake but a deliberate move by the Minister for Air. The conclusion reached is that Jones??? time in office was beneficial to the RAAF. He presided over its growth to being the world???s fourth largest air force at the end of the Second World War. He oversaw its post war demobilisation and was responsible for planning the Service???s structure to meet the Australian Government???s needs during the early years of the Cold War.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Royal Australian Air Force</field><field name="subject">Officers</field><field name="subject">biography</field><field name="subject">RAAF</field><field name="subject">Sir George Jones</field><field name="subject">Chief of Air Staff</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">administration</field><field name="subject">World War 1939-1945</field><field name="subject">W.H.

This thesis sets out to discuss the campaign by considering various factors that impacted on the RAAF in the lead up to and during the course of the Pacific war and their relevance to the campaign. It looks at the way air operations were conducted in the North-Western Area between 1942 and 1945 and describes the role played by the flying squadrons based in the area.  Using primary sources such as operational record books, documents and files at archives and libraries and interviews with veterans and experts the thesis found that the campaign was conducted in several phases. It started with the defence of Darwin. In keeping with overall allied strategy the RAAF then went on an offensive into what was then the Netherlands East Indies (NEI) using medium and heavy bombers and mine laying sea planes flying from bases in Australia???s north west.  The NEI was vital to the Japanese war effort as a source of essential raw materials such as oil, timber, and rubber. To defend this part of their new empire the Japanese had amassed large military garrisons on the islands. The vessels used to transport troops and materials became the most important targets for the RAAF???s bomber squadrons. As General MacArthur???s forces advanced along the north coast of New Guinea the North-Western Area based units conducted raids into the NEI to deceive the Japanese into thinking an invasion would be launched from Darwin. As the New  Guinea campaign gained momentum the RAAF???s task was to protect its western flank, to prevent the Japanese from moving troops and aircraft east to the Philippines.  The thesis concludes the campaign was successful because Darwin was defended, it denied the Japanese vital materials for the conduct of the war and it kept hundreds of aircraft and tens of thousands of troops away from the allied advance.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pacific War</field><field name="subject">North-Western Area</field><field name="subject">NW Area</field><field name="subject">Australian air power</field><field name="subject">air defence</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">RAAF</field><field name="subject">Royal Australian Air Force</field><field name="subject">air raids</field><field name="subject">North-Western Area</field><field name="subject">World War 2</field><field name="subject">World War Two</field><field name="subject">1941</field><field name="subject">1942</field><field name="subject">1943</field><field name="subject">1944</field><field name="subject">bombing offensive</field><field name="subject">seaplanes</field><field name="subject">fighter squadrons</field><field name="subject">NEI</field><field name="subject">Netherlands East Indies</field><field name="subject">Darwin</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Second World War</field><field name="subject">New Guinea</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study in the limitations of command : General Sir William Birdwood and the A.I.F., 1914-1918</field><field name="creator">Millar, John Dermot, History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Military command is the single most important factor in the conduct of warfare. To understand war and military success and failure, historians need to explore command structures and the relationships between commanders. In World War I, a new level of higher command had emerged: the corps commander. Between 1914 and 1918, the role of corps commanders and the demands placed upon them constantly changed as experiences brought illumination and insight. Yet the men who occupied these positions were sometimes unable to cope with the changing circumstances and the many significant limitations which were imposed upon them. Of the World War I corps commanders, William Birdwood was one of the longest serving. From the time of his appointment in December 1914 until May 1918, Birdwood acquired an experience of corps command which was perhaps more diverse than his contemporaries during this time. He is, then, an ideal subject for a prolonged assessment of this level of command.	This thesis has two principal objectives. The first is to identify and assess those factors which limited Birdwood???s capacity and ability to command. The second is to explore the institutional constraints placed on corps commanders during the 1914-1918 war.	Surprisingly, this is a comparatively barren area of research. Because very few officers spent much time as corps commanders on their way to higher command appointments and because the role of the corps commanders in military planning and in the conduct of operations was not immediately apparent, their role has been practically ignored. Historians have tended to concentrate on the Army and divisional levels creating a deficient view of higher military command in World War I. However, corps commanders could and did play an important part in planning operations and in military affairs generally. Birdwood???s experience at Gallipoli and in France reflect some of the changes to command structures that were prompted by the successes and failures of operations directed at the corps level. In as much as these two theatres of war were vastly different and Birdwood was confronted with dissimilar problems, it is possible to draw some general conclusions about the evolution of higher command after 1914.	Using a wide range of primary and secondary sources located in Australian and British archives, this thesis traces Birdwood???s career as a corps commander at Gallipoli and on the Western Front. It also examines his tenure as G.O.C. of the A.I.F.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">General William Birdwood</field><field name="subject">military command</field><field name="subject">command structures</field><field name="subject">officers</field><field name="subject">World War I</field><field name="subject">World War One</field><field name="subject">World War 1</field><field name="subject">1914-1918</field><field name="subject">military planning</field><field name="subject">operations</field><field name="subject">Army</field><field name="subject">Gallipoli</field><field name="subject">Western Front</field><field name="subject">France</field><field name="subject">Australian Imperial Force (A.I.F.) corp command</field><field name="subject">corps commanders</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phoenix from the Ashes? : Russia???s defence industrial complex and its arms exports</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, C. S., Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The continued existence of the Russian defence and arms industry, known as the Oboronnyi Promyshennyi Kompleks (OPK), was called into question following the disintegration of the Soviet Empire in 1991. Industry experts cited the lack of a domestic market, endemic corruption, and excess capacity within the industry as factors underpinning its predicted demise. The most telling factor was the sudden removal of considerable government subsidies and high defence industry wages that had traditionally buttressed the industry's economic viability and encouraged the cream of Russia's workers into the sector. It was a crippling blow. However, the industry's export customers in China, India and Iran during those early years became the OPK's saving grace. Their orders introduced hard currency back into the industry and went a long way to preventing the forecasted OPK collapse. Although pessimistic predictions continued to plague the OPK throughout the 1990s, the valuable export dollars provided the OPK the breathing space it needed to claw back its competitive advantage as an arms producer. That revival has been further underpinned by a new political commitment, various research and development initiatives, and the restoration of defence industry as a tool of Russian foreign policy.    In order to gauge the future prospects for the OPK, it is necessary to examine the domestic and external drivers that have either underwritten its success to date or are still required to ensure its long term endurance. Domestically, continued success demands a closer collaboration between the OPK and the Russian armed forces. It also requires serious efforts to curb endemic corruption, further consolidation of the defence industry and continued development of the Russian domestic market for arms. Externally, the strength of the state arms exporter, Rosoboronexport, global market diversification and joint military ventures with strategic partner countries are essential ingredients for long term OPK success. Cultivating and maintaining the economic and political momentum vital for the OPK's progress will be a daunting undertaking for Russia. However, Russia's accomplishments in these key areas since 2000 suggest that continued success is a genuine prospect and that the OPK could potentially grow to be the proverbial 'phoenix from the ashes'.    China and India constitute approximately eighty percent of the total Russian arms transfer market. Trading and cooperation with these two countries has provided Moscow with the finances to sustain its defence industry through continued orders and valuable finance for research and development programmes for military hardware. However, post 2015, the Chinese market will be nearing total saturation and the Indian market will have contracted somewhat, as the indigenous defence industries of these nations can be expected to usurp the demand for Russian equipment. This scenario, together with a more active foreign policy under Putin has seen Russia launch aggressive marketing campaigns into the Middle East, South East Asia and Latin America. The strategy has already begun to pay dividends with large contracts being signed by Algeria, Indonesia, and Venezuela. The Russians hope that large sales to these countries will trigger further sales within the respective regions. The realised or potential contracts for arms from Libya, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Mexico, and Brazil suggest that this strategy is producing the desired result.    The short term future of the Russian OPK looks promising. The rising domestic defence order is beginning to challenge the export market as the OPK's most important customer. Meanwhile, exports will be safeguarded by continued foreign demand for niche Russian defence products such as cruise missiles and air defence systems as well as cost effective and user friendly Russian aircraft, ships, submarines and land systems. Flexible financing options offered by Rosoboronexport will stimulate demand in new markets such as Algeria and Indonesia and sustain the economic viability of the OPK for at least the next decade.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Weapons industry</field><field name="subject">Russia (Federation)</field><field name="subject">defense industries</field><field name="subject">arms transfers</field><field name="subject">military policy</field><field name="subject">Oboronnyi Promyshennyi Kompleks (OPK)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural dynamics analysis in the presence of unmeasured excitations</field><field name="creator">Moore, Stephen, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Methods for comprehensive structural dynamic analysis generally employ input-output modal analysis with a mathematical model of structural vibration using excitation and response data. Recently operational modal analysis methods using only vibration response data have been developed. In this thesis, both input-output and operational modal analysis, in the presence of significant unmeasured excitations, is considered. This situation arises when a test structure cannot be effectively isolated from ambient excitations or where the operating environment imposes dynamically-important boundary conditions.  The limitations of existing deterministic frequency-domain methods are assessed. A novel time-domain estimation algorithm, based on the estimation of a discrete-time autoregressive moving average with exogenous excitation (ARMAX) model, is proposed. It includes a stochastic component to explicitly account for unmeasured excitations and measurement noise. A criterion, based on the sign of modal damping, is incorporated to distinguish vibration modes from spurious modes due to unmeasured excitations and measurement noise, and to identify the most complete set of modal parameters from a group of estimated models.  Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively identifies vibration modes even with significant unmeasured random and periodic excitations. Random noise is superimposed on response measurements in all tests. Simulated systems with low modal damping, closely spaced modes and high modal damping are considered independently. The accuracy of estimated modal parameters is good except for degreesof- freedom with a low response level but this could be overcome by appropriate placement of excitation and response measurement points.  These observations are reflected in experimental tests that include unmeasured periodic excitations over 200% the level of measured excitations, unmeasured random excitations at 90% the level of measured excitations, and the superposition of periodic and random unmeasured excitations. Results indicate advantages of the proposed algorithm over a deterministic frequency domain algorithm. Piezoceramic plates are used for structural excitation in one experimental case and the limitations of distributed excitation for broadband analysis are observed and characterised in terms of actuator geometry and modal deformation.  The ARMAX algorithm is extended for use with response measurements exclusively. Numerical and experimental tests demonstrate its performance using time series data and correlation functions calculated from response measurements.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Structural dynamics</field><field name="subject">modal analysis techniques</field><field name="subject">finite element models (FEMs)</field><field name="subject">helicopter-like structure</field><field name="subject">piezoceramic actuators</field><field name="subject">ARMAX  algorithm</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Triumph of improvisation : Australian Army operational logistics and the campaign in Papua, July 1942 to January 1943</field><field name="creator">Moremon, John Clifford, History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the Australia Army???s campaign on Papua from July 1942 to January 1943 with the focus on logistic support of the fighting arms and the relation of logistics to the tactics of tropical jungle warfare. It begins by examining the traditional approach to logistics in the military profession - the experience of Australian officers and forces in particular - from the First World War until May 1942, when the Australian territory of Papua was invaded. It establishes that the Army was poorly prepared because, as well as having never anticipated a prolonged land campaign in Papua-New Guinea, it lacked the logistic resources and knowledge of logistics as applicable to tropical jungle warfare. It then proceeds to examine the retreat over the Kokoda Track and the turning-point battles for Milne Bay and Imita Ridge. It demonstrates that the principal factor in the Australian retreat was logistic failure, as geography and lack of logistic resources prevented adequate supply of the fighting arms at least until lines of communication had been shortened; even then, difficulties remained. The thesis is rounded off by assessing the counter-attack across the territory of Papua for the capture of the enemy???s beachheads at Buna, Gona and Sanananda. It concludes that, as the island???s geography and tropical environment so dominated operations and since shortages of logistic equipment and units persisted, the Army could not perfect its logistic organisation by the end of this first phase of the New Guinea campaign. It fell back on improvisation and the fortitude of troops to triumph over the Japanese.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Papua new Guinea</field><field name="subject">Kokoda Track</field><field name="subject">Milne bay</field><field name="subject">Imita Ridge</field><field name="subject">Buna</field><field name="subject">Gona</field><field name="subject">Sanananda</field><field name="subject">logistics</field><field name="subject">World War Two</field><field name="subject">World War 2</field><field name="subject">World War II</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">Australia.

The organization, command, training, equipment, social composition, recruitment and retention of Australia???s citizen soldiers are examined in an effort to discover the solution to this problem.  The conclusion reached is that Australia???s citizen soldiers could not have fulfilled their roles, the nature of which was widely debated by British and Australian defence planners because of their differing threat perceptions. Inter-Service rivalry over money also encouraged this debate.  Basically, the A.M.F. did not have the equipment and trained troops to enable it to concentrate in time to repel a Japanese raid or invasion. Motor vehicles could have provided this mobility but their expense was prohibitive. However, in other respects the Military Board failed to make the best use of its resources. Slight changes in organization and the command structure might have made the C.M.F., once concentrated, more efficient and better able to fight the Japanese.

A neuro ensemble is a collection of neural networks that works cooperatively on a problem. In the literature, it has been shown that by combining several neural networks, the generalization of the overall system could be enhanced over the separate generalization ability of the individuals. Evolutionary computation can be used to search for a suitable architecture and weights for neural networks. When evolutionary  computation is used to evolve a neuro ensemble, it is usually known as evolutionary neuro ensemble. In most real-world problems, we either know little about these problems or the problems are too complex to have a clear vision on how to decompose them by hand. Thus, it is usually desirable to have a method to automatically decompose a complex problem into a set of overlapping or non-overlapping sub-problems and assign one or more specialists (i.e. experts, learning machines) to each of these sub-problems. An important feature of neuro ensemble is automatic problem decomposition. Some neuro ensemble methods are able to generate networks, where each individual network is specialized on a unique sub-task such as mapping a subspace of the feature space. In real world problems, this is usually an important feature for a number of reasons including: (1) it provides an understanding of the decomposition nature of a problem; (2) if a problem changes, one can replace the network associated with the sub-space where the change occurs without affecting the overall ensemble; (3) if one network fails, the rest of the ensemble can still function in their sub-spaces; (4) if one learn the structure of one problem, it can potentially be transferred to other similar problems. In this thesis, I focus on classification problems and present a systematic study of a novel evolutionary neuro ensemble approach which I call cooperative coevolutionary mixture of experts (CCME). Cooperative coevolution (CC) is a branch of evolutionary computation where individuals in different populations cooperate to solve a problem and their fitness function is calculated based on their reciprocal interaction. The mixture of expert model (ME) is a neuro ensemble approach which can generate networks that are specialized on different sub-spaces in the feature space. By combining CC and ME, I have a powerful framework whereby it is able to automatically form the experts and train each of them. I show that the CCME method produces competitive results in terms of generalization ability without increasing the computational cost when compared to traditional training approaches. I also propose two different mechanisms for visualizing the resultant decomposition in high-dimensional feature spaces. The first mechanism is a simple one where data are grouped based on the specialization of each expert and a color-map of the data records is visualized. The second mechanism relies on principal component analysis to project the feature space onto lower dimensions, whereby decision boundaries generated by each expert are visualized through convex approximations. I also investigate the regularization effect of learning by forgetting on the proposed CCME. I show that learning by forgetting helps CCME to generate neuro ensembles of low structural complexity while maintaining their generalization abilities. Overall, the thesis presents an evolutionary neuro ensemble method whereby (1) the generated ensemble generalizes well; (2) it is able to automatically decompose the classification problem; and (3) it generates networks with small architectures.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Artificial neural networks</field><field name="subject">automatic problem decomposition</field><field name="subject">binary classification</field><field name="subject">cooperative coevolution</field><field name="subject">data mining</field><field name="subject">ensemble learning</field><field name="subject">evolutionary computation</field><field name="subject">generalization</field><field name="subject">learning by forgetting</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">mixture of experts</field><field name="subject">neuro ensemble</field><field name="subject">regularization</field><field name="subject">visualization</field><field name="subject">weight distribution</field><field name="subject">weight elimination</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38752</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vietnam between China &amp; the United States (1950-1995)</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Thach Hong, Politics, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Vietnam is a tragic land, which has witnessed three successive wars since it won independence in 1945. The purpose of this dissertation is to seek answers to the question of why so many tragedies struck the Vietnamese people, and in particular to examine the contribution made by Sino-American competition to this tragic history.	Analysing the IMPACT of Sino-American relations on Chinese and American policies towards Vietnam, the study finds that Vietnam never was the primary subject of American foreign policy, though America was deeply involved in Vietnam during the twenty-five years between 1950 and 1975. Washington???s Vietnam policy was largely based on its perception of China. Likewise, Beijing???s policy towards Vietnam was greatly affected by the state of its relations with Washington.	Vietnam was a victim of their confrontation. The analysis shows that the increase in American involvement during the last stage of the first Vietnam War and the start of the second Vietnam War was due to enmity between China and the United States. US neglect was a result of Sino-American rapprochement while US isolation of Vietnam resulted from Sino-American strategic co-operation. Though the third Vietnam War was a consequence of Sino-Soviet competition, Washington also indirectly encouraged Beijing to be tough with Vietnam, as it needed Chinese support in its relations with Moscow.	Analysing changes in Chinese and American polices towards Vietnam, the study observes that when a small state is caught in an intra-power struggle, bug powers will always try to use the small state as a tool in their rivalry. The main lesson for small states is to avoid being caught in such big-power competition. Politicians in small states should also avoid taking sides with big powers lest this create opportunities for big power interference and draw the small state into big power competition. This needs the political acumen and flexibility to distinguish national interest from self-interest.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">American</field><field name="subject">America</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">foreign policy</field><field name="subject">foreign relations</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">reunification</field><field name="subject">Sino-American confrontation</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese conflict</field><field name="subject">war</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flexible representation for genetic programming : lessons from natural language processing</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Xuan Hoai, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis principally addresses some problems in genetic programming (GP) and grammar-guided genetic programming (GGGP) arising from the lack of operators able to make small and bounded changes on both genotype and phenotype space. It proposes a new and flexible representation for genetic programming, using a state-of-the-art formalism from natural language processing, Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs). It demonstrates that the new TAG-based representation possesses two important properties: non-fixed arity and locality. The former facilitates the design of new operators, including some which are bio-inspired, and others able to make small and bounded changes. The latter ensures that bounded changes in genotype space are reflected in bounded changes in phenotype space.  With these two properties, the thesis shows how some well-known difficulties in standard GP and GGGP tree-based representations can be solved in the new representation. These difficulties have been previously attributed to the treebased nature of the representations; since TAG representation is also tree-based, it has enabled a more precise delineation of the causes of the difficulties. Building on the new representation, a new grammar guided GP system known as TAG3P has been developed, and shown to be competitive with other GP and GGGP systems.  A new schema theorem, explaining the behaviour of TAG3P on syntactically constrained domains, is derived. Finally, the thesis proposes a new method for understanding performance differences between GP representations requiring different ways to bound the search space, eliminating the effects of the bounds through multi-objective approaches.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetic programming</field><field name="subject">grammar-guided</field><field name="subject">genotype space</field><field name="subject">natural language processing</field><field name="subject">phenotype space</field><field name="subject">tree adjoining grammars (TAGs)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Static liquefaction of sand with a small amount of fines</field><field name="creator">Bobei, Doru, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">[Formulae and special characters can not be reproduced here. Please see the pdf version of the Abstract for an accurate reproduction.] The thesis provides a comprehensive study on the behaviour of sand with a small amount of fines [i.e.1/3 plastic fines and 2/3 non-plastic fines]. The work is carried out experimentally under axi-symmetric conditions using the triaxial apparatus. Conventional drained triaxial tests are conducted on isotropic consolidated specimens and all the tests indicate that sand with fines does not manifest any unusual behaviour under drained conditions. However in undrained shearing the so-called ???reverse behaviour??? is noted. The study demonstrates that the reverse behaviour conforms to the critical state framework because significant changes in the position and geometry of the critical state [CS] and isotropic consolidation [IL] lines are caused by the presence of fines. These changes cannot be adequately modelled by the intergranular void ratio as proposed by Thevanayagam and Mohan (2000). This study also demonstrates that the original state parameter [special character] as proposed by Been and Jefferies (1985) is not an adequate parameter to predict the undrained behaviour trend. A new parameter termed ???modified state parameter??? [special character] is proposed to account for the combined effects of density and confining pressure. The suitability of the modified state parameter to characterise the response of parent sand and sand with fines is assessed for a range of void ratios and confining pressures. The effect of drained stress history is an important factor affecting the subsequent undrained response. Drained pre-shearing to failure is found to improve considerably the subsequent undrained response to the extent that liquefaction may not occur. Different drained pre-shearing histories have different effects on the undrained response. However in these tests [special character] has limitations in quantifying the subsequent undrained stress-strain response. Hence, a new framework of ???yielding parameter??? [special character] extends the capability of [special character] and additional data is presented to demonstrate the suitability of this concept. The implementation of [special character] depends on whether the previous stress state reached during the stress history is below or at failure. The effects of drained pre-shearing on the position and movement of failure surface are investigated. It is found that drained pre-shearing to failure at larger confining pressures has the effect of shifting upwards part of the drained failure surface. The shift at larger stress ratios [special character] may be described in terms of dilatancy and modified state parameter at failure. The so-called strain path tests are conducted to study the influence of strain increment ratio on the deformation behaviour of sand with fines. It is found that the value of [special character] has significant effects on the stress-strain behaviour. Along negative [special character] paths the soil strain softens in the form of decreasing the shear resistance before reaching the failure state. In contrast, along positive [special character] paths the soil strain hardens to an asymptotic stress ratio. The asymptotic stress ratio decreases with increasing [special character] along a linear relationship. The framework of [special character] cannot quantify the stress-strain response along positive and negative strain paths. Consequently an ???instability parameter??? [special character] is proposed to extend the capabilities of [special character] and the reliability of this parameter is further assessed. The behaviour along a range of positive and negative [special character] paths is investigated on pre-sheared specimens. In negative [special character] the effective stress paths reach a surface located higher than the monotonic failure surface on which they trace downward towards the origin of stress space. The results indicate this surface may be the same as the drained failure envelope which has been shifted as a result of drained pre-shearing. In positive [special character] paths a large improvement is noted in both the strength and stiffness of the soil. Note The parameters [special character] and [special character] are all generalisations of [special character] so that the behaviour under complex conditions can be characterised.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Axi-symmetric</field><field name="subject">fines</field><field name="subject">instability</field><field name="subject">liquefaction</field><field name="subject">modified state parameter</field><field name="subject">sand</field><field name="subject">soils</field><field name="subject">strain path testing</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">triaxial</field><field name="subject">undrained</field><field name="subject">yielding parameter</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vibro-acoustic studies of brake squeal noise</field><field name="creator">Papinniemi, Antti, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Squeal noise has been an on-going concern with automotive brake systems since their inception. Even after many decades of research no single theory exists that adequately describes the phenomenon, and no general methods for eliminating squeal noise exist. Broadly speaking, three primary methods of analysis have been applied to understanding and eliminating brake squeal: analytical, experimental and numerical. Analytical models provide some insight into the mechanisms involved when a brake squeals, but have limitations in applicability to specific brake systems. Experimental methods provide the backbone of brake squeal investigations, especially in an industrial environment. However, the core focus of this thesis is to use a large scale finite element analysis (FEA) model to investigate brake squeal.  Initially the FEA model was developed and the dynamic characteristics were validated against experimental modal analysis results. A complex eigenvalue analysis was performed to identify potential squeal modes which appear as unstable system vibration modes.  Further techniques are described that allow the deeper probing of unstable brake system modes. Feed-in energy, which is the conversion of friction work into vibrational energy during the onset of squeal, is used to determine the relative contribution of each brake pad to the overall system vibration. The distribution of the feed-in energy across the face of a brake pad is also calculated. Component strain energy distributions are determined for a brake system as a guide to identifying which components might best be modified in addressing an unstable system mode. Finally modal participation is assessed by calculating the Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) between component free modes and the component in the assembly during squeal. This allows participating modes to be visualised and aids in the development of countermeasures. The majority of the work in this thesis was performed using the commercial FEA code MSC.Nastran with user defined friction interfaces. An alternative approach using a contact element formulation available in Abaqus was also implemented and compared to the MSC.Nastran results. This analysis showed that considerable differences were noted in the results even though the overall predicted stability correlated relatively well to observed squeal. Abaqus was also used in a case study into the design of a brake rotor in a noisy brake system. The results of this study provided good correlation to observed squeal and facilitated effective rotor countermeasures to be developed. Some success was achieved in the main aims of predicting brake squeal and developing countermeasures. However, while the tools presented do allow a deeper probing of system behaviour during squeal, their use requires good correlation to observed squeal on brake system to be established. As such, their use as up-front design tools is still limited. This shortcoming stems from the complexity of brake squeal itself and the limitations in modelling the true nature of the non-linearities within a brake system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automotive brake systems analysis</field><field name="subject">rotor design</field><field name="subject">brakes</field><field name="subject">brake squeal</field><field name="subject">finite element</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38696</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Women's Royal Australian Naval Service : a study in discrimination 1939-1960</field><field name="creator">Spurling, Kathryn Lesley, History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Throughout history women have shown a willingness to participate actively in the defence of their country, home, and beliefs, and gave lie to the assertion that they were intrinsically less able than men when it came to achieving the ends through violent means.

The class of multi-objective problems (MOPs) is an important one because multi-objectivity exists in almost all aspects of human life; whereby there usually exist several compromises in each problem. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been applied widely in many real-world problems. This is because (1) they work with a population during the course of action, which hence offer more flexible control to find a set of efficient solutions, and (2) real-world problems are usually black-box where an explicit mathematical representation is unknown.  However, MOEAs usually require a large amount of computational effort. This is a sub- stantial challenge in bringing MOEAs to practice. This thesis primarily aims to address this challenge through an investigation into issues of scalability and the balance between exploration and exploitation. These have been outstanding research challenges, not only for MOEAs, but also for evolutionary algorithms in general. A distributed framework of local models using explicit niching is introduced as an overarching umbrella to solve multi-objective optimization problems. This framework is used to address the two-part question about first, the role of communication messages and second, the role of explicit niching in distributed evolutionary multi-objective optimization. The concept behind the framework of local models is for the search to be conducted locally in different areas of the decision search space, which allows the local models to be distributed on different processing nodes. During the optimization process, local models interact (exchange messages) with each other using rules inspired from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Hence, the hypothesis of this work is that running simultaneously several search engines in different local areas is better for exploiting local information, while exchanging messages among those diverse engines can provide a better exploration strategy. For this framework, as the models work locally, they gain access to some global knowledge of each other.  In order to validate the proposed framework, a series of experiments on a wide range of test problems was conducted. These experiments were motivated by the following studies which in their totality contribute to the verification of our hypothesis: (1) studying the performance of the framework under different aspects such as initialization, convergence, diversity, scalability, and sensitivity to the framework's parameters, (2) investigating interleaving guidance in both the decision and objective spaces, (3) applying local models using estimation of distributions, (4) evaluating local models in noisy environments and (5) the role of communication messages and explicit niching in distributed computing. The experimental results showed that: (1) the use of local models increases the chance of MOEAs to improve their performance in finding the Pareto optimal front, (2) interaction strategies using PSO rules are suitable for controlling local models, and that they also can be coupled with specialization in order to refine the obtained non-dominated set, (3) estimation of distribution improves when coupled with local models, (4) local models work well in noisy environments, and (5) the communication cost in distributed systems with local models can be reduced significantly by using summary information (such as the direction information naturally determined by local models) as the communication messages, in comparison with conventional approaches using descriptive information of individuals. In summary, the proposed framework is a successful step towards efficient distributed MOEAs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multi-objective problems</field><field name="subject">multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs)</field><field name="subject">communication messages</field><field name="subject">explicit niching</field><field name="subject">distributed computing</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="subject">multiple criteria decision making</field><field name="subject">mathematical optimization</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal placement of sensor and actuator for sound-structure interaction system</field><field name="creator">Suwit, Pulthasthan, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the practical and novel work in the area of optimal placement of actuators and sensors for sound-structure interaction systems. The work has been done by the author during his PhD candidature. The research is concentrated in systems with non-ideal boundary conditions as in the case in practical engineering applications. An experimental acoustic cavity with five walls of timber and a thin aluminium sheet fixed tightly on the cavity mouth is chosen in this thesis as a good representation of general sound-structure interaction systems. The sheet is intentionally so fixed that it does not satisfy ideal boundary conditions. The existing methods for obtaining optimal sensor-actuator location using analytic models with ideal boundary conditions are of limited use for such problem with non-ideal boundary conditions. The method presented in this thesis for optimal placement of actuators and sensors is motivated by energy based approach and model uncertainty inclusion. The optimal placement of actuator and sensor for the experimental acoustic cavity is used to construct a robust feedback controller based on minimax LQG control design method. The controller is aimed to reduce acoustic potential energy in the cavity. This energy is due to the structure-borne sound inside the sound-structure interaction system. Practical aspects of the method for optimal placement of actuator and sensors are highlighted by experimental vibration and acoustic noise attenuation for arbitrary disturbance using feedback controllers with optimal placement of actuator and sensor. The disturbance is experimentally set to enter the system via a spatial location different from the controller input as would be in any practical applications of standard feedback disturbance rejections. Experimental demonstration of the novel methods presented in this thesis attenuate structural vibration up to 13 dB and acoustic noise up to 5 dB for broadband frequency range of interest. This attenuation is achieved without the explicit knowledge of the model of the disturbance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sound structure interaction system</field><field name="subject">sensors</field><field name="subject">actuators</field><field name="subject">detectors</field><field name="subject">acoustical engineering</field><field name="subject">linear quadratic gaussian (LQG)</field><field name="subject">vibration</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">active noise and vibration control</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The process of forest conservation in Vanuatu : a study in ecological economics</field><field name="creator">Tacconi, Luca, Economics &amp; Management, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The objective of this thesis is to develop an ecological economic framework for the assessment and establishment of protected areas (PAs) that are aimed at conserving forests and biodiversity. The framework is intended to be both rigorous and relevant to the decision-making process. 	Constructivism is adopted as the paradigm guiding the research process of the thesis, after firstly examining also positivist philosophy and ???post-normal??? scientific methodology. The tenets of both ecological and environmental economics are then discussed. An expanded model of human behaviour, which includes facets derived from institutional economics and socioeconomics as well as aspects of neoclassical economics, is outlined. The framework is further developed by considering, from a contractarian view point, the implications of intergenerational equity for biodiversity conservation policies. The issues of intragenerational distribution and allocation are then considered. In this regard, cost-benefit analysis (CBA), as applied to the valuation of forests, PAs, and biodiversity, is critically reviewed. A participatory approach to decision-making, which may also include CBA, is then proposed. 	The resulting ecological economic framework may be thus summarised: (a) ecosystem use patterns should be chosen on the basis of their sustainability, distributional, and efficiency aspects; (b) systems of PAs should be established in order to achieve minimal intergenerational equity; (c) intragenerational equity requires the correction of the asymmetrical distribution of the costs and benefits arising from the establishment of PAs; (d) the institutional features relevant to the environmental-economic issues being analysed should be considered; and (e) the decision-making process should be participatory and action oriented. 	The framework is applied to two case studies in Vanuatu. These applications detail (a) stakeholders??? views and trade-offs faced in relation to forest management (b) modes of participatory research and decision-making, (c) forms of compensation that may be adopted in correcting asymmetrical distributions of the costs and benefits of PAs, and (d) institutional influences on ecosystems use and implications for conservation projects. The institutional arrangements developed for the establishment of the PAs are presented. The application of this ecological economic framework has resulted in the formal establishment of one PA and the identification and assessment of five other PAs.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biodiversity. biological diversity</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">constructivism</field><field name="subject">cost-benefit analysis (CBA)</field><field name="subject">decision-making</field><field name="subject">deforestation</field><field name="subject">ecological economic framework</field><field name="subject">ecosystem use patterns</field><field name="subject">ecosystems</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">environmental</field><field name="subject">equity</field><field name="subject">Erromango Kauri Protected Area</field><field name="subject">forest management</field><field name="subject">forests</field><field name="subject">intergenerational</field><field name="subject">intragenerational</field><field name="subject">Malekula Island</field><field name="subject">positivism</field><field name="subject">protected areas</field><field name="subject">sandalwood cultivation. sustainability</field><field name="subject">Vanuatu</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pareto multi-objective evolution of legged embodied organisms</field><field name="creator">Teo, Jason T. W., Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The automatic synthesis of embodied creatures through artificial evolution has become a key area of research in robotics, artificial life and the cognitive sciences. However, the research has mainly focused on genetic encodings and fitness functions. Considerably less has been said about the role of controllers and how they affect the evolution of morphologies and behaviors in artificial creatures. Furthermore, the evolutionary algorithms used to evolve the controllers and morphologies are pre-dominantly based on a single objective or a weighted combination of multiple objectives, and a large majority of the behaviors evolved are for wheeled or abstract artifacts. In this thesis, we present a systematic study of evolving artificial neural network (ANN) controllers for the legged locomotion of embodied organisms. A virtual but physically accurate world is used to simulate the evolution of locomotion behavior in a quadruped creature. An algorithm using a self-adaptive Pareto multi-objective evolutionary optimization approach is developed. The experiments are designed to address five research aims investigating: (1) the search space characteristics associated with four classes of ANNs with different connectivity types, (2) the effect of selection pressure from a self-adaptive Pareto approach on the nature of the locomotion behavior and capacity (VC-dimension) of the ANN controller generated, (3) the effciency of the proposed approach against more conventional methods of evolutionary optimization in terms of computational cost and quality of solutions, (4) a multi-objective approach towards the comparison of evolved creature complexities, (5) the impact of relaxing certain morphological constraints on evolving locomotion controllers. The results showed that: (1) the search space is highly heterogeneous with both rugged and smooth landscape regions, (2) pure reactive controllers not requiring any hidden layer transformations were able to produce sufficiently good legged locomotion, (3) the proposed approach yielded competitive locomotion controllers while requiring significantly less computational cost, (4) multi-objectivity provided a practical and mathematically-founded methodology for comparing the complexities of evolved creatures, (5) co-evolution of morphology and mind produced significantly different creature designs that were able to generate similarly good locomotion behaviors. These findings attest that a Pareto multi-objective paradigm can spawn highly beneficial robotics and virtual reality applications.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">artificial life</field><field name="subject">artificial neural networks</field><field name="subject">body-brain co-evolution</field><field name="subject">complexity measures</field><field name="subject">differential evolution</field><field name="subject">evolutionary algorithms</field><field name="subject">evolutionary complexity measures</field><field name="subject">differential evolution</field><field name="subject">evolutionary algorithms</field><field name="subject">evolutionary multi-objective optimization</field><field name="subject">evolutionary artificial neural networks</field><field name="subject">evolutionary robotics</field><field name="subject">morpho-functional machines</field><field name="subject">multi-objective optimization</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical study of footings near sloped fills and 3D effects of Sackville Embankment</field><field name="creator">Thanapalasingam, Jegan, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Numerical analyses of two different geotechnical problems, namely a bridge abutment and a geosynthetic reinforced embankment are presented in this thesis. Settlement, bearing capacity and slope stability are the major factors that need to be considered in the design of a foundation near a sloped fill. In this thesis, the behaviour of a small scale model footing located near the shoulder of a sloped fill was investigated numerically. Single and multiple layers of geogrid were used to reinforce the sloped fill, and their effects on the load-deformation behaviour and bearing capacity of the footing were explored. The analyses showed 80%, 168%, 295% and 375% maximum improvement in the ultimate bearing capacity with 1, 2, 3 and 4 reinforcement layers respectively. This maximum improvement depends on the embedment depths of the reinforcement layers below the foundation and the suggested optimal depths are discussed. Typically, greatest improvement in ultimate bearing capacity with a single layer of reinforcement was obtained when the reinforcement was at a depth between 0.50 and 0.75 times the foundation width. Similarly, highest ultimate bearing capacity with 2 reinforcement layers was predicted when the spacing between them was 1.0 times the width of the foundation. However, higher settlement was estimated at failure for the reinforced sloped fill than the unreinforced one. The second problem investigated was the three-dimensional (3D) analysis of Sackville embankment, a geosynthetic reinforced embankment on soft soil. Previous analyses using two-dimensional (2D) numerical modelling of Sackville embankment indicated potential 3D effects affecting the performance of this embankment. Therefore, 3D analysis incorporating geometric variations of Sackville embankment foundation soil, anisotropic model for fluid flow, mobilization of geotextile stresses in minor direction and the boundary effects (lateral directions) were taken into account in this analysis. The predicted performance of Sackville embankment were compared with the field data and the previously reported 2D analysis results in terms of vertical and horizontal displacements and excess pore pressures in the foundation soil, and geotextile stresses, strains and displacements. Better overall predictions of the Sackville embankment performance was obtained from this 3D analysis than the previous analysis reported in the literature.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bridge abutment</field><field name="subject">numerical analysis</field><field name="subject">Sackville embankment</field><field name="subject">geosynthetic</field><field name="subject">reinforced</field><field name="subject">geotechnical</field><field name="subject">reinforce</field><field name="subject">reinforcement</field><field name="subject">foundations</field><field name="subject">3D effects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38683</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The geomorphology of Southeast Australian mountain streams</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Chris J., Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the morphology and sediment transport dynamics of mountain streams in southeast Australia. Mountain streams represent important geomorphological and ecological systems in Australia which have hitherto been poorly studied. The variability of mountain stream reach morphology was investigated at the regional scale using topographical surveys and sediment sampling techniques. Study sites were stratified by slope and local lithology. Eight channel-morphologies including Bedrock, Cascade, Step-pool, Planebed, Pool-Riffle, Cascade-pool, Riffle-step and Infilled, were identified using an objective statistical approach. Overall, channel types were found to correspond to existing reach-scale mountain stream templates. Five morphologies were associated with a specific lithology type which controlled the size and shape of grains supplied to the channels.  Differences in coarse sediment transport processes between morphologies were investigated using stream monitoring techniques and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating. Monitoring results from a 3 year period indicated that channel beds are resistant to entrainment with shear stress thresholds for bedload transport ranging between 64 to 74 N/m2. Transport of reach median grain sizes requires floods that exceed bankfull discharge. Existing competence equations were found to over-predict the hydraulic driving force and consequently, a modified entrainment model was used to account for the regional channel characteristics.   OSL dating was investigated as a tool to provide data on long-term sediment transport processes. Minimum age model results from the OSL dates show overall agreement with a selected entrainment model, and indicate differences in sediment transport dynamics between some reach morphology types. A regime model was used to quantify the physical domains of different channel morphologies. Limitations of the model were overcome by modifying the sediment supply surrogate to better reflect the dominant transported bedload size. Morphology types were delineated according to different sediment transport capacity-sediment supply domains.  The distribution of channel morphology types within a series of catchments in southeast Australia was modelled within a GIS platform using the diagnostics of reach morphology derived from this study. The model provides a conceptual framework to evaluate the potential link between channel form, potential habitat diversity and aquatic biodiversity within the channel network in mountain streams.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mountain streams</field><field name="subject">morpho-statistical classification</field><field name="subject">channels</field><field name="subject">optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL)</field><field name="subject">bed material storage</field><field name="subject">morphologies</field><field name="subject">habitat diversity</field><field name="subject">catchment</field><field name="subject">bedload transport</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">sediment</field><field name="subject">geomorphology</field><field name="subject">Southeast</field><field name="subject">Southeastern</field><field name="subject">river channels</field><field name="subject">sedimentation</field><field name="subject">deposition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Video object segmentation using phase-base detection of moving object boundaries</field><field name="creator">To, Thang  Long, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">A video sequence often contains a number of objects. For each object, the motion of its projection on the video frames is affected by its movement in 3-D space, as well as the movement of the camera. Video object segmentation refers to the task of delineating and distinguishing different objects that exist in a series of video frames.  Segmentation of moving objects from a two-dimensional video is difficult due to the lack of depth information at the boundaries between different objects. As the motion incoherency of a region is intrinsically linked to the presence of such boundaries and vice versa, a failure to recognise a discontinuity in the motion field, or the use of an incorrect motion, often leads directly to errors in the segmentation result. In addition, many defects in a segmentation mask are also located in the vicinity of moving object boundaries, due to the unreliability of motion estimation in these regions.  The approach to segmentation in this work comprises of three stages. In the first part, a phase-based method is devised for detection of moving object boundaries. This detection scheme is based on the characteristics of a phase-matched difference image, and is shown to be sensitive to even small disruptions to a coherent motion field. In the second part, a spatio-temporal approach for object segmentation is introduced, which involves a spatial segmentation in the detected boundary region, followed by a motion-based region-merging operation using three temporally adjacent video frames. In the third stage, a multiple-frame approach for stabilisation of object masks is introduced to alleviate the defects which may have existed earlier in a local segmentation, and to improve upon the temporal consistency of object boundaries in the segmentation masks along a sequence.  The feasibility of the proposed work is demonstrated at each stage through examples carried out on a number of real video sequences. In the presence of another object motion, the phase-based boundary detection method is shown to be much more sensitive than direct measures such as sum-of-squared error on a motion-compensated difference image. The three-frame segmentation scheme also compares favourably with a recently proposed method initiated from a non-selective spatial segmentation.  In addition, improvements in the quality of the object masks after the stabilisation stage are also observed both quantitatively and visually. The final segmentation result is then used in an experimental object-based video compression framework, which also shows improvements in efficiency over a contemporary video coding method.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Boundaries</field><field name="subject">boundary</field><field name="subject">clustering</field><field name="subject">compression</field><field name="subject">extraction</field><field name="subject">extract</field><field name="subject">images</field><field name="subject">integration</field><field name="subject">mask</field><field name="subject">move</field><field name="subject">moving</field><field name="subject">motion</field><field name="subject">object</field><field name="subject">objects</field><field name="subject">phase correlation</field><field name="subject">segmentation</field><field name="subject">spatial</field><field name="subject">stability</field><field name="subject">temporal</field><field name="subject">video</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Law and politics : Australia's war crimes trials in the Pacific, 1943-1961</field><field name="creator">Pappas, Caroline, History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the trial of Japanese war crimes conducted by Australia between 1945 and 1951; although the study commences in 1943, when the Government first focussed on the issue, and ends in 1961, when the issue was closed. Beyond providing an overview of the trials the thesis addresses the major criticism of the trials by looking at whether the trails were fair and if they fulfilled Australian aims. This is addressed within the context of the two elements of international law, the political, and the legal, and examined in each of the three sections.  The Policy section establishes the political context of the trials by examining the influence of the international community and the Australian Government. Both influenced structure and progress rather than the final application of the law. When Australian attitudes were incongruous with international views, a perception that Australia was harsh and repressive developed even though justice was an important part of the Government???s agenda.  A study of legal aspects of the trials commences in the Procedures section. Australia???s legislation and regulations are explained with particular emphasis on the more controversial aspects, and a comparison is made with the war crimes instruments of other Allies trying the Japanese showing many similarities between the regulations used by other nations and Australia???s. Procedures also discusses the framework for the Australian trials, the procedures used to bring a case to trial, the process used in court, the review process and the carrying out of sentences. Such a thorough study of the procedural basis is necessary to evaluate the individual trials.  Practical examples of some of the procedural problems are also discussed in the following section ??? Practice. This section reviews a number of trials and the various types of crimes and the claims made in defence to show how Australia applied and interpreted the law. The study finds many similarities between Australia???s application of the law and the practice of other nations, indicating that Australian courts were applying what was considered to be customary expectations of behaviour.  Throughout the trials there was little evidence of vindictiveness or revenge, either by Government or in the courts. Both were faced with significant problems, which were not always dealt with well but overall the trials were fair and those involved were concerned that justice should not only be seen to be done, but actually be done.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">allied</field><field name="subject">courts</field><field name="subject">crimes</field><field name="subject">imprisonment</field><field name="subject">investigations</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">justice</field><field name="subject">Kavieng</field><field name="subject">Laha Airfield</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">legal</field><field name="subject">legislation</field><field name="subject">massacre</field><field name="subject">murder</field><field name="subject">Ocean island</field><field name="subject">prisoners of war</field><field name="subject">prison camps</field><field name="subject">procedures</field><field name="subject">regulations</field><field name="subject">release</field><field name="subject">sentences</field><field name="subject">Tan Toey</field><field name="subject">theft</field><field name="subject">trials</field><field name="subject">War Crimes Act 1945</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habitat fragmentation and the southern brown bandicoot Isoodon obesulus at multiple spatial scales</field><field name="creator">Paull, David James, Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the process of habitat fragmentation and the spatial and temporal scales at which it occurs. Fragmentation has become an important topic in biogeography and conservation biology because of the impacts it has upon species??? distributions and biodiversity. Various definitions of fragmentation are available but in this research it is considered to be the disruption of continuity, either natural or human-induced in its origins and operative at multiple spatial scales. Using the distribution of the southern brown bandicoot Isoodon obesulus as a case study, three spatial scales of fragmentation were analysed. At the continental scale, the Australian distribution of the subspecies I. o. obesulus was examined in relation to climate, geology and vegetation cover at the time of European settlement of Australia and two centuries later. Using archived wildlife records and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analyses, habitat suitability models were created to assess natural and human-induced fragmentation of the distribution of I. obesulus in 1788 and 1988. At the regional scale, a study was made of the distribution of I. obesulus in the south-east of the State of South Australia. Again, natural and human-induced patterns of habitat fragmentation were modelled using GIS with climate, soil and vegetation data for the time of European settlement and at present. At the local scale, the distribution of I. obesulus was the subject of a detailed field survey of 372 sites within 29 remnant patches of native vegetation in south-eastern South Australia in order to understand the variables that cause habitat fragmentation. Geographic information systems were used again but in a different way to carefully stratify the field survey by overlaying maps of topography, vegetation and past fires. The large dataset collected from the surveys was described using six generalized linear models which identified the significant variables that fragment the distribution of I. obesulus at a local scale. From the results of the field surveys, a subset of four remnants was chosen for further GIS spatial modelling of the probability of I. obesulus occurring within remnants in response to fire via a controlled burning programme put in place to reduce accumulating fuel loads. These investigations show that habitat fragmentation can be caused by different factors at different spatial scales. At the continental scale, it was found that climate played a dominant role in influencing the fragmented distribution of I. obesulus but vegetation change during the past two centuries has also had a profound impact on the availability of habitat. Within south-eastern South Australia, the species??? regional scale distribution is constrained by climate and also by soil and vegetation patterns. Dramatic change to its regional distribution occurred in the 20th century as a result of the clearance of native vegetation for planting pastures, crops and pines. Fragmentation at the regional scale has resulted in the remaining habitat being reduced to small, isolated, remnant patches of native vegetation. At the local scale it was found that variables which disrupt the continuity of I. obesulus habitat within remnants include vegetation cover in the 0-1 m stratum, abundance of Xanthorrhoea australis and soil texture. For a subset of sites located in one landsystem of the study area, named Young, the age of vegetation since it was last burnt was also found to be a significant variable, with vegetation 10-14 years old since burning providing the most suitable habitat. Spatial modelling of two scenarios for prescribed burning over 15 years revealed that the use of fire as a habitat enhancement tool will be complicated and require a detailed understanding of the factors that cause natural fragmentation in the distribution of I. obesulus at the local scale. A further conclusion of the study was that ecological relationships between species and their habitats require careful interpretation of multi-scaled datasets and conservation plans for endangered species ought to be made at multiple spatial scales. Future research directions are identified including the linking of multi-scaled habitat fragmentation models to genetic studies of the species throughout its range.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Southern brown bandicoot</field><field name="subject">Isoodon obesulus</field><field name="subject">habitat modification</field><field name="subject">fire</field><field name="subject">scale distribution</field><field name="subject">spatial</field><field name="subject">continental</field><field name="subject">regional</field><field name="subject">local</field><field name="subject">marsupial</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="subject">vegetation</field><field name="subject">geographic information systems (GIS)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38698</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fuel moisture and fuel dynamics in woodland and heathland vegetation of the Sydney Basin</field><field name="creator">Pippen, Brendan Gerard, Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The vegetation of the Sydney Basin, Australia, is highly flammable and subject to a wide range of fire regimes. Sclerophyllous shrubs and sedges are common and in some vegetation types up to 70 % of fuel consumed during a fire can be live. Research into fire behaviour and fuel dynamics has been minimal. To address this issue this thesis investigated the principal factor affecting the ease of ignition and rate of combustion of individual fuel particles and fuel beds in bushfires: dead fine fuel moisture (FFM). Two common Sydney Basin vegetation types, eucalypt woodland and heathland, each with a history of problematic fire management, were measured in the field for diurnal fluctuations in FFM following rain, under conditions similar to when prescribed burns are conducted. The FFM components of current operational fire behaviour models were found to be inadequate for predictions of FFM and fire behaviour under these conditions.  The equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of five fuel types from the field site was investigated in a laboratory study. An existing function describing EMC as a function of temperature and relative humidity was evaluated and found to be very accurate for these fuels. Two FFM predictive models incorporating this function were evaluated on the field data and the laboratory results were shown to be applicable to the estimation of FFM in the field. One model gave very accurate predictions of FFM below fibre saturation point, but its accuracy was reduced when screen level conditions were used instead of those measured at fuel level. A recent process-based model that accounts for rainfall showed promise for predicting when fuel is &lt; 25 % FFM. Systematic problems with the radiation budget of this model reduced the accuracy of predictions and further refinement is required.  Live fine fuel moisture content (LFMC) of common heathland shrubs and sedge was investigated over two years and found to be both seasonal and influenced by phenology. LFMC minima occurred in late winter and spring (August to October), and maxima were in summer (December to February) when new growth was recorded. The dominant near-surface fuel in mature heath was sedge. It was found to have little seasonal variation in its??? percentage dead but the percentage dead maxima occured at the same time as the LFMC minima of shrubs and sedge in both years.  Simple instantaneous models for duff moisture content in woodland and heathland and LFMC and the percentage dead sedge in heathland were developed. The information gained by this study will form the basis for future development of fuel moisture models for prescribed burning guidelines and fire spread models specific to the vegetation communities of the Sydney Basin.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sydney Basin</field><field name="subject">eucalypt woodland</field><field name="subject">heathland shrubs</field><field name="subject">fuel moisture content</field><field name="subject">bushfires</field><field name="subject">forest fires</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38697</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The investigation of factors governing ignition and development of fires in heathland vegetation</field><field name="creator">Plucinski, Matthew Paul, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Heathlands typically experience regimes consisting of frequent and intense fires.  These fire regimes play important roles in the lifecycles and population dynamics of all species in these communities.  Prescribed fire is commonly applied to heathlands to minimise the risk of wildfires as well as to promote biodiversity.  Ignitions in heathlands tend to either be unsustainable, or quickly develop into rapidly spreading intense fires.  This presents a major problem for the application of prescribed fire and is the primary focus of this thesis.  Heathland ignition has been investigated in three sections; litter ignition; vertical development of fire into the shrub layer; and horizontal spread through the shrub layer.  These were studied in laboratory experiments using miniature versions of field fuels.  Ignition success in litter layers was related to the dead fuel moisture content.  Litter type, ignition source, and presence of wind were found to affect the range of ignitable fuel moisture contents of a litter bed.  The effect of litter type was best explained by density.  Dense litter beds required drier conditions for ignition than low density litter beds.  The vertical development of fire into shrubs was mostly dependent on live fuel moisture content, but crown base height, presence of wind, ignition source, shrub height and the percentage of dead elevated fuel were also important.  Horizontal spread of fires through shrub layers was most affected by the presence of a litter layer, with nearly all ignitions successful when there was an underlying litter fire.  Fire spread would only occur in shrubs without a litter layer when the shrub layer was dense and dry, or had a substantial dead fuel component.  Spread was more likely to be sustained when there was wind.  Models predicting the moisture content of dead fuels were tested in heathlands, and as would be expected those that can be calibrated for different fuel types were found to have the best performance.  Fuel moisture content and fuel load models were reviewed for heathlands, and a number of recommendations for future research were made.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bushfires</field><field name="subject">combustibility</field><field name="subject">field fuels</field><field name="subject">fire behaviour</field><field name="subject">fire develpoment</field><field name="subject">fire dynamics</field><field name="subject">fire ecology</field><field name="subject">fire spread</field><field name="subject">fires</field><field name="subject">fuel accumulation</field><field name="subject">fuel loads</field><field name="subject">fuel moisture</field><field name="subject">heathlands</field><field name="subject">heathland fuels</field><field name="subject">horizontal spread</field><field name="subject">ignition</field><field name="subject">laboratory experiments</field><field name="subject">litter beds</field><field name="subject">litter ignition</field><field name="subject">litter type</field><field name="subject">statistical modelling</field><field name="subject">models</field><field name="subject">moisture content</field><field name="subject">prescribed fire</field><field name="subject">shrublands</field><field name="subject">vertical development</field><field name="subject">wildfires</field><field name="subject">winds</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial forecasting using artificial neural networks</field><field name="creator">Prasad, Jayan Ganesh, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite the extent of a theoretical framework in financial market studies, a vast majority of the traders, investors and computer scientists have relied only on technical and timeseries data for predicting future prices. So far, the forecasting models have rarely incorporated macro-economic and market fundamentals successfully, especially with short-term predictions ranging less than a month. In this investigation on the predictability of certain financial markets, an attempt has been made to incorporate a un-exampled and encompassing set of parameters into an Artificial Neural Network prediction system. Experiments were carried out on three market instruments ??? namely currency exchange rates, share prices and oil prices. The choice of parameters for inclusion or exclusion, and the time frame adopted for the experimental sets were derived from the market literature. Good directional prediction accuracies were achieved for currency exchange rates and share prices with certain parameters as inputs, which consisted of predicting short-term movements based on past movements. These predictions were better than the results produced by a traditional least square prediction method.

It proposes that Richardson foregrounds the work of gender ideology in her novels, and that her work is also conscious about its own fictional procedures. This thesis argues that Richardson consciously examines the ideological aspect of narrative modes, such as naturalism, the Bildungsroman, and popular romance. Moreover, it illustrates her attempts to invent narrative strategies which subvert the conventional assumptions about gender inherent in those forms. ???Gender Ideology and Narrative Form??? draws on recent theoretical approaches to narrative, ideology, subjectivity, and dialogism, to argue that Richardson makes the ideological shaping of her stories most visible through manipulations of genre, plot, narrative voice, and point of view. Aspects of ideology examined include the Victorian and late-Victorian equation of masculinity with public rationality, mind, public achievement, and genius: and, on the other hand, the association of femininity with the body, passion, and private or domestic spaces. The thesis also considers some of the values and assumptions about gender implicit in nineteenth-century scientific thinking. Henry Handel Richardson has been viewed as a conservative writer, in both aesthetic and political terms. By contrast, I suggest that she resists the moral and representational codes of the realist or naturalist form, and that her uncompromising oppositional strategy achieves a number of radical results. It exposes and criticises the masculinist bias of certain representational methods; it offers new ways of representing female experience; and it insists that the private sphere must be treated also as a political space in which crucial power relationships are at work. My approach to Henry Handel Richardson???s fiction opens new ways to see her work as the product of a distinctive feminist consciousness.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Henry Handel Richardson</field><field name="subject">Australian women authors</field><field name="subject">gender identity in literature</field><field name="subject">narrative form</field><field name="subject">narrative voice</field><field name="subject">gender ideology</field><field name="subject">Australian fiction</field><field name="subject">Australian women's writing</field><field name="subject">historical fiction</field><field name="subject">feminist consciousness</field><field name="subject">Maurice Guest</field><field name="subject">Getting of Wisdom</field><field name="subject">Fortunes of Richard Mahony</field><field name="subject">Young Cosima</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38688</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scattering of light by dust in bipolar outflow sources</field><field name="creator">Quinn, Dale Edward, Physics, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Interstellar dust plays an important role in the physics of the interstellar medium, as well as the formation and evolution of stars. The presence of dust is often indicated in optical images by dark lanes which bisect spiral galaxies, or seen directly as reflection nebulosity around stars or emission nebulosity if sufficient heating is present. Of interest in this thesis is the dust that is associated with bipolar outflow sources. Bipolar outflows can occur in either evolved stars or in young stellar objects, and are so named because they consist of two lobes which are thought to be due to out-flowing dust and gas, with a dark lane between them due to thick dust in a circumstellar disk or shell which often blocks the light from the central star.  The spatial distribution of the properties of dust around bipolar outflow sources has been examined using a combination of theoretical and observational techniques. To aid the interpretation of observations of bipolar outflow sources, we have modelled the wavelength dependence of light from 0.36 to 22\um, scattered by dust particles with varying characteristics. The results were then presented in the form of colour excess ratios. These model ratios can be applied to observations if the contribution due to the central star is able to be removed, such that all that remains in the image is the effect of the dust particles.  The scattering of light by dust particles was modelled by varying six different characteristics: grain material, size (particle radius from 0.002 to 0.75\um), mantle temperatures and thicknesses, shape, and orientation. Of those characteristics, the largest variation in the colour excess ratios resulted from varying grain composition and size. Different scattering angles also produce a noticeable variation in the colour excess ratios, however the effect is difficult to distinguish from the general extinction due to dust around the source. Water ice mantles were also found to significantly change the colour excess ratios. Grain shape and orientation produced only small variations in the colour excess ratios.  Three bipolar outflow sources were studied as part of this thesis, two evolved objects, OH~231.8+4.2 and Mz\,3, and the young T-Tauri object Rno\,91. The observations involved multi-wavelength imaging in the infrared, from which colours and colour excess ratios were obtained at various points of the bipolar outflows and then compared to the predictions made in the modelling.  The most extensive data set analysed was seven images of the object OH~231.8+4.2 which were used in a multi-wavelength study in the infrared H to N bands (1.25--12\um). The central source position of the object has been confined to less than an arcsec using the longer wavelength images and an L--M colour image. The two peaks which dominate the lobes in the shorter wavelength images were found to be scattering peaks where the light from the central source is scattered from the walls of the lobes. The spatial distribution of water ice in the nebula has also been constrained to the circumstellar disk which has a torus or disk shape rather than being a spherical shell.  The colour excess ratios derived for the nebula from the images also suggest slightly different dust properties between the circumstellar disk, lobe walls and within the lobe cavities.  The young T-Tauri star Rno\,91 also contains ice, and was observed between J and L. The central star which illuminates the nebula was shown to be coincident with the brightest point in these images. Using colour excess ratio results for various parts of the nebula, it was shown that the dust close to the central star is likely to contain larger grains than the diffuse ISM, but with a similar composition. Moving away from the central star, the dust becomes more like that observed in the diffuse ISM. The presence of water ice on dust close to the central star was confirmed using images centred in the ice band.  The protoplanetary bipolar outflow source Mz\,3 is slightly more evolved than OH 231.8+4.2, and does not have evidence of any water ice in the circumstellar disk. Images of this object were obtained between J and 10\um. The presence of warm dust throughout the inner bipolar lobes of this object is noticeable by the brightness of the lobes in the image at 10\um. Line profiles through the position of the central source of the 10\um\ image demonstrate that there is a circumstellar shell close to the central source which has an inner radius of $\lta\,375$\,AU. Colour excess ratio results for the bipolar lobes suggest that the dust associated with Mz\,3 is generally smaller than that found in the diffuse ISM. The properties of the dust in the bipolar lobes were also observed to be different to the dust closer to the central source and lying in the circumstellar disk. The small sizes for dust in Mz\,3 is consistent with the high velocity outflows that have been associated with the object.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interstellar dust</field><field name="subject">bipolar outflows (astrophysics)</field><field name="subject">dust particles</field><field name="subject">scattering of light</field><field name="subject">nebula</field><field name="subject">cosmic dust</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38687</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neglected Australians : prisoners of war from the Western Front, 1916-1918</field><field name="creator">Regan, Patrick Michael, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">About 3850 men of the First Australian Imperial Force were captured on the Western Front in France and Belgium between April 1916 and November 1918.

This thesis is the first attempt to fill this gap in our knowledge and understanding of the history of the Australian Army. In doing so it will consider the ways in which the Light Horse evolved, the place it had in defence thinking, the development of its doctrine, its organisational changes and the way in which that organisation and its men interacted with their society. This thesis firstly analyses the role and place of the mounted soldier in the British and colonial/dominion armies in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries before going on to examine what effects the debates about this had on the development of Australia???s mounted troops. It will find that in the nineteenth century the disparate mounted units of the Australian colonies were established mainly along the organisational model of the mounted rifleman. Influenced by social ideas about citizen soldier horsemen and a senior officer with firm views, this model continued to be used by the new Light Horse until well into the First World War. During that war it was gradually discovered that this military model had its limitations and by the end of the war much of the Light Horse had become cavalry. This discovery in turn meant that during the inter-war period cavalry continued to be part of the army. Analysed in depth also are the many organisational changes that affected the mounted branch during its existence. Some of these reflected doctrinal and tactical lessons, and others were the result of various plans by the government and military authorities to improve the army. It will be seen that regardless of these plans part-time citizen horse units continued to have many problems and they rarely came to be what the government wanted of them. That they were as strong as they were was testimony to the efforts of a dedicated and enthusiastic few.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Light Horse</field><field name="subject">Army</field><field name="subject">cavalry</field><field name="subject">World War</field><field name="subject">1914-1918</field><field name="subject">World War One</field><field name="subject">World War 1</field><field name="subject">World War I</field><field name="subject">South African War</field><field name="subject">1899-1902</field><field name="subject">Boer War</field><field name="subject">mounted troops</field><field name="subject">citizen soldiers</field><field name="subject">soldier</field><field name="subject">organisation</field><field name="subject">organization</field><field name="subject">Light Horse Brigade</field><field name="subject">Light Horse Regiment</field><field name="subject">Mounted Rifles</field><field name="subject">Australian military history</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian Imperial Force</field><field name="subject">Light Horsemen</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38689</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complexities in the valuation of natural resources and the development of the choice modelling technique</field><field name="creator">Rolfe, John, Economics &amp; Management, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Choice Modelling technique is an emerging technique which appears to have strengths relative to other non-market valuation techniques. The latter group are important in the assessment of the tradeoffs involved in environmental and resource use tradeoffs. However, the use of these techniques is often criticised where ethical and moral frameworks are involved, where it is unclear how difficult choices are being framed against each other, or where it is unclear how values change according to the scope of the amenity under consideration  The primary focus of the thesis is on the development of the Choice Modelling technique, which provides a richer information set to researchers than other techniques such as Contingent valuation method. However, the richness of this data is offset to some degree by the complexity of application, where careful attention is needed for design, application and analytical stages.  In this thesis, a series of four Choice Modelling experiments are reported, as well as two small Contingent Valuation experiments. The Choice Modelling experiments were centred on the estimation of values that Australians might hold for rainforest conservation in Vanuatu. In order to frame and scope the tradeoffs of interest within the broad pool of substitute goods (such as rainforest conservation opportunities in other countries), the Choice Modelling technique appeared more suitable than the single tradeoff preservation of the Contingent Valuation method.  The results of Choice Modelling experiments involved sets of parameters indicating that the probability of choice depended on a number of attributes used to make up the conservation profiles together with the influence of unobserved attributes. As a willingness-to-pay variable was included within the attributes making up choice profiles, estimates of value were available by predicting how changes in particular attributes could be offset by changes in the willingness-to-pay variable.  The major conclusions of the research presented in the thesis were that the involvement with ethical and moral frameworks does not invalidate the use of non-market valuation techniques, and that the Choice Modelling technique has strengths in relation to scooping and framing issues. In particular, the research demonstrates that the information generated from an experiment can be used in an iterative approach to develop more accurate models of choice. As well, the research shows that the amenity of interest, rainforest conservation in Vanuatu, can have positive values for Australian residents relative to other conservation opportunities.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Choice modelling technique</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">natural resources</field><field name="subject">non-market valuation technique</field><field name="subject">rainforest</field><field name="subject">Vanuatu</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38691</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient broadband antenna array processing using the discrete fourier form transform</field><field name="creator">Sayyah Jahromi, Mohammad Reza, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Processing of broadband signals induced on an antenna array using a tapped delay line filter and a set of steering delays has two problems. Firstly one needs to manipulate large matrices to estimate the filter coefficients. Secondly the use of steering delays is not only cumbersome but implementation errors cause loss of system performance.  This thesis looks at both of these problems and presents elegant solutions by developing and studying a design method referred to as the DFT method, which does not require steering delays and is computationally less demanding compared to existing methods.  Specifically the thesis studies and compares the performance of a time domain element space beamformer using the proposed method and that using an existing method, and develops the DFT method when the processor is implemented in partitioned form. The study presented in the thesis shows that the processors using the DFT method are robust to look direction errors and require less computation than that using the existing method for comparable performance.  The thesis further introduces a broadband beamformer design which does not require any steering delays between the sensors and the tapped delay line section as is presently the case. It has the capability of steering the array in an arbitrary direction with a specified frequency response in the look direction while canceling unwanted uncorrelated interferences.  The thesis presents and compares the performance of a number of techniques to synthesize an antenna pattern of a broadband array. These techniques are designed to produce isolated point nulls as well as broad sector nulls and to eliminate the need for the steering delays.  Two of the pattern synthesis techniques presented in the thesis allow optimization against unwanted interferences in unknown directions. The techniques allow formulation of a beamforming problem such that the processor is not only able to place nulls in specified directions but also able to cancel directional interferences in unknown directions along with a specified frequency response in the look direction over a band of interest.  The thesis also presents a set of directional constraints such that one does not need steering delays and an array can be constrained in an arbitrary direction with a specified frequency response. The constraints presented in the thesis are simple to implement. Based on these constraints a pattern synthesis technique for broadband antenna array is also presented.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Broadband</field><field name="subject">beamformer</field><field name="subject">frequency</field><field name="subject">discrete Fourier transform (DFT)</field><field name="subject">transformations</field><field name="subject">antenna array</field><field name="subject">arrays</field><field name="subject">signals</field><field name="subject">processors</field><field name="subject">processing</field><field name="subject">computation load</field><field name="subject">directional constraints</field><field name="subject">computer simulation</field><field name="subject">bandwidths</field><field name="subject">signal to noise ratio (SNR)</field><field name="subject">pattern synthesis techniques</field><field name="subject">steering delays</field><field name="subject">time domain method (TDM)</field><field name="subject">digital techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38690</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Something peculiar to themselves'? : a social history of the Executive Branch officers of the Royal Australian Navy, 1913-1950</field><field name="creator">Sears, Jason, History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">In 1985 Richard Preston identified three Royal Navy (RN) traditions (recruitment of officers at an early age, selection of officers from an elite social group, and insistence on sea service) which had shaped the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). These traditions, he argued, ensured a high level of professionalism amongst officers in the infant RCN, as well as complete interoperability between the two navies, but failed to recognise the distinct needs of Canadian society. Consequently, from the Second World War onwards the RCN chose to move away from the British model and to ???Canadianise??? its officer corps.  The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) also adopted these traditions, and they are examined here in the context of the social backgrounds, development and character of the permanent executive branch officers of the RAN between 1913 and 1950. This thesis argues that while the British model ensured a high level of professionalism within the RAN officer corps, in many other areas the system proved to be of doubtful utility for Australia.  Although the Australian government tried to ensure that its naval officers maintained an Australian character and identity, the selection, training and operational policies of the RAN meant that its officers were, to all intents and purposes, virtually indistinguishable from their RN colleagues.  While RAN officers were highly disciplined and professional men with excellent seamanship skills, unfortunately a wide social gulf developed between the Navy???s officers and its sailors. Further, the essentially scientific and practical education and indoctrination that naval officers received in their early years, combined with their narrow professional development, meant that they were, at best, only average higher level administrators and often performed poorly in dealings with their Australian political masters.  The system produced a conservative type of officer, suspicious of political activity and intellectual effort, bound to the tradition of ???the Silent Service???, who felt that his country did not understand his work or sacrifices but who had not the capacity to change such community perceptions. Lacking highly educated and politically aware senior officers, the RAN found it difficult to cope with social changes after the Second World War. Consequently, the ???Australianisation??? of the naval officer corps was a slow and painful process and the profession of naval officer in Australia was to be even more marginal than numbers alone dictated.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Royal Australian Navy</field><field name="subject">RAN</field><field name="subject">officers</field><field name="subject">social life and customs</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">naval education</field><field name="subject">sea service</field><field name="subject">officer/sailor relations</field><field name="subject">discipline and unrest</field><field name="subject">responsibility</field><field name="subject">command</field><field name="subject">promotion</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Program distribution estimation with grammar models</field><field name="creator">Shan, Yin, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis studies grammar-based approaches in the application of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) to the tree representation widely used in Genetic Programming (GP).  Although EDA is becoming one of the most active fields in Evolutionary computation (EC), the solution representation in most EDA is a Genetic Algorithms (GA) style linear representation. The more complex tree representations, resembling GP, have received only limited exploration. This is unfortunate, because tree representations provide a natural and expressive way of representing solutions for many problems. This thesis aims to help fill this gap, exploring grammar-based approaches to extending EDA to GP-style tree representations. This thesis firstly provides a comprehensive survey of current research on EDA with emphasis on EDA with GP-style tree representation. The thesis attempts to clarify the relationship between EDA with conventional linear representations and those with a GP-style tree representation, and to reveal the unique difficulties which face this research.  Secondly, the thesis identifies desirable properties of probabilistic models for EDA with GP-style tree representation, and derives the PRODIGY framework as a consequence.  Thirdly, following the PRODIGY framework, three methods are proposed. The first method is Program Evolution with Explicit Learning (PEEL). Its incremental general-to-specific grammar learning method balances the effectiveness and efficiency of the grammar learning. The second method is Grammar Model-based Program Evolution (GMPE). GMPE realises the PRODIGY framework by introducing elegant inference methods from the formal grammar field. GMPE provides good performance on some problems, but also provides a means to better understand some aspects of conventional GP, especially the building block hypothesis. The third method is Swift GMPE (sGMPE), which is an extension of GMPE, aiming at reducing the computational cost.  Fourthly, a more accurate Minimum Message Length metric for grammar learning in PRODIGY is derived in this thesis. This metric leads to improved performance in the GMPE system, but may also be useful in grammar learning in general. It is also relevant to the learning of other probabilistic graphical models.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Distribution algorithms</field><field name="subject">estimation of distribution</field><field name="subject">explicit learning</field><field name="subject">genetic programming</field><field name="subject">grammar models</field><field name="subject">linear representation</field><field name="subject">probabilistic models</field><field name="subject">Program Evolution with Explicit learning (PEEL)</field><field name="subject">PRODIGY</field><field name="subject">tree representation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the performance of different group communication modes : using soft systems methodology to investigate factors</field><field name="creator">Shaw, Gregory John, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis has two distinct research threads. One thread examines the effectiveness of technology support on the performance of focus groups. Unlike previous research, the work described in this thesis addresses the fundamental issue that groups are social systems, and that comprehensive measurement of the effectiveness of group activities requires assessment of both the task-oriented and social aspects of the group activity. In this research, four different communication modes are used to compare group effectiveness. The second research thread in this thesis is the use of Systems Thinking, and specifically Soft Systems Methodology (SSM), as the framework for inquiring into the effects of technology support on group effectiveness. The strategy in this thesis for developing and evaluating hypotheses extends the general descriptions and guidance in the literature on using SSM for hypothesis testing. Systems thinking also provides the basis for examining the prevailing ???profile deviation??? view that the better the fit between the group task and the technology support the greater the group performance. Using the six perspectives of fit developed by Venkatraman (1989), the most common GSS models and other models developed to examine Task-Technology Fit (TTF) are analysed. The results show that group performance models are most often tested from a ???profile deviation??? perspective and TTF models developed from a profile deviation perspective claim to have predictive and descriptive validity for assessing the level of group performance. To assess whether an SSM based approach can improve the predictive and/or descriptive analysis of the impact of technology support on group work, a field experiment was conducted at the Australian Defence Force Academy. Twenty focus groups of officer cadets assessed their military training program using a GSS in one of four communication modes. The results showed little predictive or descriptive support for the profile deviation perspective of TTF when measuring the group???s overall effectiveness, task effectiveness, participant satisfaction or group relations. The alternative ???gestalt??? perspective, operationalised in this research by using SSM, provided a more comprehensive approach to examining the effectiveness of technology support for group work.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Group Support Systems</field><field name="subject">Task-technology fit</field><field name="subject">soft systems methodology</field><field name="subject">systems thinking</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The factors influencing the employment of the Australian Defence Organisation in homeland security roles since 11 September 2001</field><field name="creator">Smith, Andrew, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis makes an assessment of the factors influencing the involvement of the Australian Defence Organisation (ADO) in homeland security roles since 11 September 2001 (9/11).  This is approached on a largely empirical basis, using document analysis and case studies supported with interviews with key individuals and experts.  The thesis commences with an Introduction that provides brief context for the thesis and specifies its central question as ???what factors have shaped the role of the ADO in Australia's response to the homeland security environment that has emerged since 11 September 2001.???  Chapter One provides an historical and theoretical context for the key concepts of homeland security and the challenges confronting Western governments in the homeland security arena.  Chapter Two explores the implications of those challenges for Australia, before outlining the research method and providing a literature review.  Chapter Three is an historical exposition of homeland security in Australia from British settlement in 1788 until 2001.  The Chapter examines events in increasing detail in the 30 years immediately prior to 2001, including a detailed case study of ADO support to the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games, before drawing some broad conclusions on the Australian experience of the involvement of its Defence Organisation in homeland security pre-9/11.  Chapter Four establishes the pre-9/11 status quo in relation to the ADO???s involvement in homeland security role before analysing the general pattern of those roles.  Chapter Five analyses and draws conclusions about the reasons for the ADO???s pre-9/11 involvement in homeland security roles, introducing an hypothetical construct to explain causal factors.  Chapter Six examines the ADO???s involvement in homeland security roles post-9/11, including cases studies of ADO support to the conduct of the 2002 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games.  Chapter Seven analyses and identifies the factors led to the ADO???s pattern of involvement in homeland security post-9/11, further developing the hypothetical construct introduced in Chapter 5.  Chapter Seven also contains supporting case studies on the ADO???s contribution to Australia???s national chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear response capability and on the state of New South Wales??? homeland security capabilities.  Chapter Eight draws overall conclusions, including recommendations for Australian policy development and areas for further research.  The essential conclusion reached is that the ADO???s involvement in homeland security roles, both before and since 9/11, has been shaped mostly by pragmatic political and managerial considerations of governments.  Developments have normally occurred in an episodic and incremental fashion in response to ???trigger events,??? although 9/11 altered this pattern somewhat by acting as a ???threshold??? event that re-calibrated demands and expectations for ADO involvement. Supporting Appendices provide detail on the Australian Government???s strategic guidance on ADO involvement in homeland security since 1973; on Australia???s policy for Defence Assistance to the Civilian Community and Defence Force Aid to the Civil Authorities; and on the involvement of former Department of Defence employees in non-Defence homeland-security related roles.

Please see the pdf version of the Abstract for an accurate reproduction.] Indium nitride is an important III-V nitride semiconductor with many potential applications such as in high frequency transistors, laser diodes and photo voltaic cells. The mobility and peak drift velocity of this material are predicted to be extremely high and superior to that of gallium nitride. However, many material properties such as the origin of the n-type conductivity and the electronic band gap are not well understood. Moreover, there is limited information on the stoichiometry and the level of impurity contaminations in the films from different growth techniques.  The n-type conductivity observed for as-grown indium nitride films has long been attributed to nitrogen vacancies, implying that the material is nitrogen deficient. A band gap value around 2 eV, as measured by the optical absorption method, is suggested by some authors to be a result of the formation of an InNIn2O3 alloy. Alternatively, the observation of a lower absorption edge, suggesting a band gap around 0.7 eV, may be caused by Mie scattering at indium clusters that may form during film growth.  Secondary ion mass spectroscopy and x-ray techniques provide only qualitative composition information. The quantitative interpretation of the results relies on calibration samples which are not available for indium nitride. In Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, while quantitative, the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen signals cannot be separated unless the film is very thin ([tilde]150 nm). However, with heavy ion Elastic Recoil Detection (ERD) analysis all the elements in indium nitride films can be fully separated even for a film thickness of [tilde] 800 nm.  In this work, indium nitride films from different growth techniques have been analysed with ERD using 200 MeV 197Au projectiles. The observed nitrogen depletion during the ERD analysis was monitored as a function of projectile fluence using a gas ionisation detector with a large solid angle. Different models have been tested and it has been shown that the bulk molecular recombination model accurately describes the nitrogen depletion so that the original nitrogen-to- indium ratio can be measured with an accuracy of [plus or minus]3 [percent].  The correlation of nitrogen depletion rate and stopping power of the projectile ion has been investigated. The study has shown that the rate of depletion is slower for low-Z projectiles. It has been shown that for a film with good structural properties, no loss of nitrogen occurs during the ERD analysis with low-Z projectiles such as 42 MeV 32S. Thus, the original nitrogen-to-indium ratio can be obtained without any theoretical modelling, and with a precision of better than [plus or minus]1 [percent]. All the indium nitride films studied in this work, for which X-ray diffraction shows no metallic indium, are nitrogen-rich which is contradictory to expectation. Therefore, the common assertion that nitrogen vacancies are the cause of n-type conductivity in as-grown films is diffcult to explain. Instead, the existence of In vacancies, N antisites and interstitial N2 may be speculated. The carbon and oxygen contamination is an issue for films grown by all common growth techniques. However, the suggested correlation of oxygen content in the film with the apparent band gap is not supported by the ERD results. Instead, a correlation between nitrogen-to-indium ratio and the measured band gap has been observed for films grown by RF-sputtering.  This work reports the implantation of radioisotope probes using negative ions. The 111In/Cd probe was selected for this work as it is a common Perturbed Angular Correlation (PAC) probe and ideally suited for the study of indium nitride. For the synthesis of the probe 111In/Cd, several possibilities, such as the production of 111In/Cd via nuclear fusion evaporation reactions and from commercially available 111InCl3 solutions, were explored. Different materials, including powders of Al2O3 and In2O3, were investigated as a carrier for the probe in the ion source of the radioisotope implanter. It has been established that combining the 111InCl3 solution as the source and In2O3 powder as the carrier material gives optimum implantation efficiency. The radioisotope implanter facility has been developed to a stage that the radioisotope probe 111In/Cd can be routinely implanted into materials as molecular 111InO?? ions. An implantation rate of 3x10 4[th]  Becquerel per hour has been demonstrated. Measurements on different materials (Ag, In, Ni, Si, InP) have shown that condensed matter spectroscopies such as Low Temperature Nuclear Orientation, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance on Oriented Nuclei (NMRON) and Perturbed Angular Correlation can be reliably performed. NMRON measurements on silver indicate a new resonance frequency of 75.08 MHz for 111InAg at 8.0 T.  The local lattice environment of indium nitride thin films has been investigated with PAC spectroscopy. Several methods of introducing a radioisotope probe into a host material have been investigated for indium nitride. The thermal diffusion of the radioisotope probe 111In/Cd into indium nitride at a temperature below the dissociation temperature (about 550 [degrees] C) was not possible. The probe was, however, successfully introduced into indium nitride films with ion implantation techniques. Recoil implantation at MeV energies following fusion evaporation reactions and ion implantation at keV energies, both have been investigated for indium nitride films. An interaction frequency of v = 28 MHz has been measured for the 111In/Cd probe in indium nitride. This result is consistent with that obtained for indium nitride bulk grains. The PAC results suggest that all types of indium nitride films have a highly disordered lattice which could only be partially improved by annealing. Furnace annealing in nitrogen atmosphere above 400 [degrees] C resulted in the dissociation of the film. However, such dissociation could be avoided with rapid thermal annealing up to 600 [degrees] C. More detailed defect studies with PAC require the availability of better material.  This study has also shown that indium nitride is highly sensitive to ion beam irradiation. Severe depletion of nitrogen during exposure to ions with MeV and KeV energies is an issue for the ion beam characterisation and processing of indium nitride.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indium nitride films</field><field name="subject">semiconductor</field><field name="subject">photo voltaic cells</field><field name="subject">laser diodes</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">optical absorption method</field><field name="subject">radioistope</field><field name="subject">negative ions</field><field name="subject">ion</field><field name="subject">elastic recoil detection</field><field name="subject">radiation</field><field name="subject">spectroscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life in the lower deck of the Royal Australian Navy 1911-1952</field><field name="creator">Spurling, Kathryn Lesley, History, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the development of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), during the period 1911 to 1952 from the perspective of the men of the lower deck, the RAN ratings.

The class distinction which functioned in the RN, when applied to the more egalitarian Australians caused ill-feeling and led to the breakdown of discipline. The Australian Commonwealth Naval Board strongly resisted attempts by the Australian Government and the Australian people to regulate its affairs, a situation which seriously disadvantaged the RAN ratings and their families.

However, these drives sometimes produce unacceptably high levels in vibration and acoustic noise. A literature survey has revealed that while there has been intensive research on the design of inverters to minimize acoustic noise radiation from these drives, the vibro-acoustic behaviour of an induction motor structure has received relatively little attention. The primary objective of this research project, therefore, is to develop a general strategy/algorithm for estimating the acoustic noise radiated from inverter-driven induction motors.  By using a three-phase, 2.2 kW induction motor, the vibration modes due to various structural components (such as the rotor, the stator/casing, the endshields and the base plate) of the motor structure were analysed by experimental modal testing. Results indicate that the vibration modes due to the rotor are only important at low frequencies. It has been found that the power injection method gives more accurate measurement of the damping of a motor structure than the modal testing and the time decay methods. If a point force excitation is used, then it is more accurate to measure the sound radiation efficiency than the power conversion efficiency for motor structures.  The effect of three different inverter designs (an ideal ???almost sinusoidal??? controller and two commercially available PWM inverters) on the radiated acoustic power were assessed for both no-load and load conditions using sound intensity measurements conducted in an anechoic room. The results indicate that although the sound power level due to aerodynamic and mechanical noise increases at a rate of 12 dB per doubling of the motor speed, the electromagnetic noise dominates at low motor speeds and is still a significant noise source even at high motor speeds. For inverters with low switching frequencies, the radiated sound power level is almost 15 dB higher than the ideal case at low speeds and is relatively insensitive to the motor speed. For inverters that implement the random modulation technique, the change in the total sound power level with the level of the random modulation is very small but the tonal nature of the noise is greatly reduced.  The vibration behaviour of a motor structure was modeled using the finite element method (FEM) and validated using the experimental modal testing results. It has been found that it is essential to model the laminated stator as an orthotropic structure. While the details of other structural components (such as the endshields, the teeth in the stator and the windings) are not so important, it is essential that they are incorporated into the structural model as simplified structures to account for their mass, stiffness and boundary conditions imposed on the motor structure. Based on this structural model, the radiated acoustic power for various operating conditions has been predicated using the boundary element (BEM) and the electromagnetic force calculated from an electromagnetic finite element model. The predicted results agree reasonably well with experimental measurements.  Despite the success of the FEM/BEM approaches, they can be prohibitively expensive (in terms of computer resources required) to apply to large motors and high frequencies. Thus the feasibility of using a statistical method, namely, the statistical energy analysis (SEA), to estimate the radiated acoustic sound power from an inverter-driven induction motor has been examined. In order to carry out this analysis, analytical expressions for calculating the natural frequencies and radiation efficiency of finite length circular cylindrical shells (which are simplified models of the stator and casing of a motor structure) were firstly derived. The internal loss factors and coupling loss factors of the motor structure were determined experimentally using the power injection method. Then by introducing an equivalent surface mobility of circular cylindrical shells for the electromagnetic force, the vibration response and the acoustic noise radiated from each part of the motor structure were estimated. Results indicate that SEA method is potentially an efficient and effective tool in estimating the noise radiated from inverter-driven induction motors.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vibro-acoustic analysis</field><field name="subject">induction motor</field><field name="subject">inverters</field><field name="subject">motor structure</field><field name="subject">electromagnetic noise</field><field name="subject">numerical analysis</field><field name="subject">finite element method</field><field name="subject">boundary element method</field><field name="subject">statistical energy analysis</field><field name="subject">finite length cylindrical shells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power and politics in information systems : a new model of conflict and a challenge for project managers</field><field name="creator">Warne, Leoni, Computer Science, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research study is to investigate and identify the impact of conflict on the success of information systems development. While specific hypotheses and research propositions are tested and investigated, the broader objectives of the study are to: explore the nature of conflict in an information system development and the extent to which conflict may be perceived to impact on the successful progress of a project; to determine which type of conflict may pose the most risk to an information systems development; and to determine to what extent conflict can be said to be contributing factor to information systems failure.  This study is structured into two different stages: a major case study conducted to explore the nature of conflict in a prematurely terminated information systems development and to probe the extent to which conflict is perceived to pose a risk to information systems projects; and a second stage surveying IT managers to test the wider applicability of the case findings.  Findings include a predictive model of conflict showing that the independent variables: Extent of the Conflict; Degree of  Perceived Impediment caused by conflict; Assessment and Management of Conflict; and finally, the Type of Conflict, impact on the probability of project success.  Some of the primary theories on conflict derived from the study include the finding that conflict involving users has the greatest negative impact on the probability of success of an information systems development. This includes User/User conflict which is at least equal to, and may even exceed the negative impact of Developer/User conflict in an information systems development environment. User/User conflict is the most potentially damaging type of conflict in an information systems development environment as this type of conflict is less frequently detected and resolved than conflict involving developers.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Case studies</field><field name="subject">conflict</field><field name="subject">developer</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">failure</field><field name="subject">information systems</field><field name="subject">interpersonal</field><field name="subject">manager</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">planning</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">project</field><field name="subject">organisations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Platinum anti-cancer complexes</field><field name="creator">Wheate, Nial Joseph, Chemistry, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">[Formulae and special characters can only be approximated here. Please see the pdf version of the Abstract for an accurate reproduction.]  Several inert platinum complexes were synthesised: [(en)Pt([special character]-dpzm)2Pt(en)]4+, [{Pt(dien)}2[special character]-dpzm]4+, [{Pt(dien)}2[special character]-H2N-(CH2)6-NH2]4+, cis-[(NH3)2Pt([special character]--dpzm)2Pt(NH3)2]4+, trans-[Pt(NH3)2([special character]-dpzm)2]2+. Three active complexes, all with chloro ligands, were also synthesised: trans-[{Pt(NH3)Cl2}2[special character]-dpzm)], trans-[{Pt(NH3)2Cl}2[special character]-dpzm]2+ (di-Pt) and trans-[trans-{Pt(NH3)2Cl}2{trans-[Pt(NH3)2([special character]-dpzm)2]}]4+ (tri-Pt).	1H NMR established that multi-nuclear platinum complexes will preferentially associate in the DNA minor groove with a preference for A/T sequences, and with a binding constant [special character]-105 M-1, regardless of the charge, linking ligand, length or shape. Using [(en)Pt([special character]-dpzm)2Pt(en)]4+ and the oligonucleotide d(GC)5 it was determined that the metal complex binds G/C rich sequences also in the minor groove, but with a much reduced binding constant, 103 M-1. CD studies showed [(en)Pt([special character]-dpzm)2Pt(en)]4+ was able to induce a DNA conformation change from B-type to what appeared to be a partial Z-type. Transcription assays showed that even though the metal complex does not bind DNA covalently, it is still able to inhibit DNA transcription at particular sites.	The complexes di-Pt, tri-Pt, [{Pt(dien)}2[special character]-dpzm]4+ and trans-[Pt(NH3)2([special character]-dpzm)2]2+ were tested for anti-cancer activity in the L1210 murine leukaemia cell line, and gave values of 3.8, 2.5, [special character]200 and 64 [special character]M respectively. In the cisplatin resistant line (L1210/DDP), trans-[Pt(NH3)2([special character]-dpzm)2]2+ showed an increase in activity with a drop to 32 [special character]M, while both di-Pt and tri-Pt showed decreases in activity to values of 8.8 and 3.6 [special character]M. In the human ovarian carcinoma 2008 cell line and its cisplatin resistant derivative C13[special character]5, both complexes showed good activity with values of 2.5 and 20.9 [special character]M respectively, but again both showed decreases in activity in the resistant line with values of 17.8 and 37.7 [special character]M respectively.	To help explain the difference between activity of these complexes and the complexes BBR3464 and BBR3005, cell uptake and DNA interstrand cross-linking experiments were performed. The cell uptake studies showed that both di-Pt and tri-Pt are taken up by cells at very high levels, when administered at 100 [special character]M, thus indicating that the difference is unlikely to be due to large differences in cell uptake. The DNA interstrand cross-linking studies showed both complexes readily form interstrand adducts (50% interstrand cross-linking at 12 nM and 22 nM respectively, c.f cisplatin 3 [special character]M). These results suggest that the rigid nature of the dpzm linker may be affecting the DNA adducts formed, with more interstrand links being formed than BBR3464. Possibly, it is this that causes the large differences in cytotoxicity.		The DNA binding of di-Pt and tri-Pt was examined with the nucleosides adenosine and guanosine and the dinucleotide d(GpG). Both complexes bound at the N7 of guanosine, but 2-fold slower than cisplatin. In addition, di-Pt bound at the N7 and either the N1 or N3 of adenosine, 7-fold slower than guanosine. Di-Pt forms a large variety of cross-links between two d(GpG) molecules, however it could not be established whether the 1,2-intrastrand adduct could be formed. Di-Pt, however, forms a 1,2-GG interstrand adduct with the oligonucleotide d(ATGCAT)2 resulting in a conformation change away from B-type DNA. The sugar pucker of the G3 nucleoside changes from 2[special character]-endo towards 3[special character]-endo, and the position of the nucleotide relative to the sugar changes from anti to syn.	The ability of multi-nuclear platinum complexes to form covalent adducts in the DNA minor groove remains unclear. It appears that di-Pt can form up to 33% minor groove adducts with the oligonucleotide d(AT)5, but when added to the oligonucleotide d(GCCAAATTTCCG)2 no definite minor groove adducts are seen and the major adduct appears to be a 1,2-interstrand cross-link between the two A6's or between the G1 and G11.	Finally, a study of the encapsulation of platinum complexes within cucurbit[7]uril (Q7) as a means of reducing drug toxicity was made. For complex A and di-Pt, encapsulation of the linker ligand occurred. The effect of Q7 on the rate of hydrolysis of di-Pt was at least a 3-fold reduction as compared to free di-Pt with guanosine. Studies with [{Pt(dien)}2[special character]-dpzm]4+/Q7 and the oligonucleotide d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 showed that the metal complex could dissociate from the Q7 and associate with the oligonucleotide, where an equilibrium is achieved with 15 % of the metal complex bound to the oligonucleotide and 75 % encapsulated in Q7. Tests in the L1210 and L1210/DDP cancer cell lines showed that di-Pt/Q7 has almost the same activity compared to free di-Pt.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BBR3464</field><field name="subject">BBR3571</field><field name="subject">BBR3610</field><field name="subject">BBR3611</field><field name="subject">Cell uptake</field><field name="subject">Cucurbit[7]uril  (Q7)</field><field name="subject">Cytotoxicity</field><field name="subject">Di-Pt</field><field name="subject">DNA binding</field><field name="subject">DNA interstrand cross-linking</field><field name="subject">DNA pre-association</field><field name="subject">Inert dinuclear platinum complexes</field><field name="subject">Ligands</field><field name="subject">Metal complex encapsulation</field><field name="subject">Multi-nuclear platinum complexes</field><field name="subject">Platinum anti-cancer complexes</field><field name="subject">Synthesis</field><field name="subject">Toxicity reduction</field><field name="subject">Tri-Pt</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A networked multi-agent combat model : emergence explained</field><field name="creator">Yang, Ang, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Simulation has been used to model combat for a long time. Recently, it has been accepted that combat is a complex adaptive system (CAS). Multi-agent systems (MAS) are also considered as a powerful modelling and development environment to simulate combat. Agent-based distillations (ABD) - proposed by the US Marine Corp - are a type of MAS used mainly by the military for exploring large scenario spaces. ABDs that facilitated the analysis and understanding of combat include: ISAAC, EINSTein, MANA, CROCADILE and BactoWars. With new concepts such as networked forces, previous ABDs can implicitly simulate a networked force. However, the architectures of these systems limit the potential advantages gained from the use of networks. In this thesis, a novel network centric multi-agent architecture (NCMAA) is pro-posed, based purely on network theory and CAS. In NCMAA, each relationship and interaction is modelled as a network, with the entities or agents as the nodes. NCMAA offers the following advantages: 1. An explicit model of interactions/relationships: it facilitates the analysis of the role of interactions/relationships in simulations; 2. A mechanism to capture the interaction or influence between networks; 3. A formal real-time reasoning framework at the network level in ABDs: it interprets the emergent behaviours online. For a long time, it has been believed that it is hard in CAS to reason about emerging phenomena. In this thesis, I show that despite being almost impossible to reason about the behaviour of the system by looking at the components alone because of high nonlinearity, it is possible to reason about emerging phenomena by looking at the network level. This is undertaken through analysing network dynamics, where I provide an English-like reasoning log to explain the simulation. Two implementations of a new land-combat system called the Warfare Intelligent System for Dynamic Optimization of Missions (WISDOM) are presented. WISDOM-I is built based on the same principles as those in existing ABDs while WISDOM-II is built based on NCMAA. The unique features of WISDOM-II include: 1. A real-time network analysis toolbox: it captures patterns while interaction is evolving during the simulation; 2. Flexible C3 (command, control and communication) models; I 3. Integration of tactics with strategies: the tactical decisions are guided by the strategic planning; 4. A model of recovery: it allows users to study the role of recovery capability and resources; 5. Real-time visualization of all possible information: it allows users to intervene during the simulation to steer it differently in human-in-the-loop simulations. A comparison between the fitness landscapes of WISDOM-I and II reveals similarities and differences, which emphasise the importance and role of the networked architecture and the addition of strategic planning. Lastly but not least, WISDOM-II is used in an experiment with two setups, with and without strategic planning in different urban terrains. When the strategic planning was removed, conclusions were similar to traditional ABDs but were very different when the system ran with strategic planning. As such, I show that results obtained from traditional ABDs - where rational group planning is not considered - can be misleading. Finally, the thesis tests and demonstrates the role of communication in urban ter-rains. As future warfighting concepts tend to focus on asymmetric warfare in urban environments, it was vital to test the role of networked forces in these environments. I demonstrate that there is a phase transition in a number of situations where highly dense urban terrains may lead to similar outcomes as open terrains, while medium to light dense urban terrains have different dynamics</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Combat models</field><field name="subject">agent based distillation (ABD)</field><field name="subject">complex adaptive system (CAS)</field><field name="subject">military analysis</field><field name="subject">multi-agent systems</field><field name="subject">networked forces</field><field name="subject">network centric multi-agent architecture (NCMAA)</field><field name="subject">network theory</field><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="subject">Warfare Intelligent System for Dynamic Optimization of Missions (WISDOM-I)</field><field name="subject">WISDOM-II</field><field name="subject">command control communications</field><field name="subject">tactical decisions</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A scalable evolutionary learning classifier system for knowledge discovery in stream data mining</field><field name="creator">Dam, Hai Huong, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Data mining (DM) is the process of finding patterns and relationships in databases. The breakthrough in computer technologies triggered a massive growth in data collected and maintained by organisations. In many applications, these data arrive continuously in large volumes as a sequence of instances known as a data stream. Mining these data is known as stream data mining. Due to the large amount of data arriving in a data stream, each record is normally expected to be processed only once. Moreover, this process can be carried out on different sites in the organisation simultaneously making the problem distributed in nature. Distributed stream data mining poses many challenges to the data mining community including scalability and coping with changes in the underlying concept over time. In this thesis, the author hypothesizes that learning classifier systems (LCSs) - a class of classification algorithms - have the potential to work efficiently in distributed stream data mining. LCSs are an incremental learner, and being evolutionary based they are inherently adaptive. However, they suffer from two main drawbacks that hinder their use as fast data mining algorithms. First, they require a large population size, which slows down the processing of arriving instances. Second, they require a large number of parameter settings, some of them are very sensitive to the nature of the learning problem. As a result, it becomes difficult to choose a right setup for totally unknown problems. The aim of this thesis is to attack these two problems in LCS, with a specific focus on UCS - a supervised evolutionary learning classifier system. UCS is chosen as it has been tested extensively on classification tasks and it is the supervised version of XCS, a state of the art LCS. In this thesis, the architectural design for a distributed stream data mining system will be first introduced. The problems that UCS should face in a distributed data stream task are confirmed through a large number of experiments with UCS and the proposed architectural design. To overcome the problem of large population sizes, the idea of using a Neural Network to represent the action in UCS is proposed. This new system - called NLCS { was validated experimentally using a small fixed population size and has shown a large reduction in the population size needed to learn the underlying concept in the data. An adaptive version of NLCS called ANCS is then introduced. The adaptive version dynamically controls the population size of NLCS. A comprehensive analysis of the behaviour of ANCS revealed interesting patterns in the behaviour of the parameters, which motivated an ensemble version of the algorithm with 9 nodes, each using a different parameter setting. In total they cover all patterns of behaviour noticed in the system. A voting gate is used for the ensemble. The resultant ensemble does not require any parameter setting, and showed better performance on all datasets tested. The thesis concludes with testing the ANCS system in the architectural design for distributed environments proposed earlier. The contributions of the thesis are: (1) reducing the UCS population size by an order of magnitude using a neural representation; (2) introducing a mechanism for adapting the population size; (3) proposing an ensemble method that does not require parameter setting; and primarily (4) showing that the proposed LCS can work efficiently for distributed stream data mining tasks.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Data mining</field><field name="subject">Action map</field><field name="subject">Classification</field><field name="subject">Data stream</field><field name="subject">Neural network</field><field name="subject">Noisy data</field><field name="subject">Non-stationary environment</field><field name="subject">Reinforcement learning</field><field name="subject">Rule-based system</field><field name="subject">Static environment</field><field name="subject">Stream data mining</field><field name="subject">Supervised learning</field><field name="subject">Distributed data mining</field><field name="subject">Dynamic environment</field><field name="subject">Ensemble learning</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary computation</field><field name="subject">Genetic algorithm</field><field name="subject">Knowledge discovery</field><field name="subject">Learning classifier system</field><field name="subject">Negative correlation learning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38865</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of insect monitoring radar technology for monitoring locust migrations in inland Eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Wang, Haikou, Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">To evaluate the utility of insect monitoring radar (IMR) technology for long-term  monitoring of insect migration, a mini-network of two IMR units in Bourke, NSW, and Thargomindah, Qld, and a base-station server in Canberra, ACT, was set up in eastern  Australia. The IMR operated automatically every night under the control of a personal  computer that also conducted data acquisition and processing. Digitisation of radar  signals, their analysis (delimitation of echoes from background noise and adjoining  echoes, followed by extraction of estimates for each target's speed, displacement  direction, body alignment, radar cross-section, and wingbeat frequency and modulation  pattern), and generation of observation summaries were implemented as a fully  automated procedure. Wingbeat frequency was found to be retrievable from the IMR's  rotary-beam signals, and this allowed each individual target to be characterised by its  wingbeat as well as its size and shape. By drawing on ancillary information from the  Australian Plague Locust Commission's database of field survey and light trap records,  the echo characters indicative of Australian plague locust, Chortoicetes terminifera  (Walker), were identified. Using these, about 140 nights with detectable plague locust  migrations were identified for the Bourke IMR site during 1998 - 2001 and 31 nights  for Thargomindah during 1999 - 2000. Analysis of these nights confirmed that C.  terminifera migrates in association with disturbed weather, especially tropical troughs,  in eastern Australia. Trajectory simulation based on IMR-derived displacement  directions and flight speeds allowed the identification of population movements likely  to reach favourable habitats and thus to develop rapidly and possibly cause a plague.  The outbreak during 1999 - 2001 most likely originated from the southeastern  agricultural belt after migrations and multiplications over several generations. The IMR  observations demonstrated that C. terminifera migrates over long distances with the  wind at night and indicated that it may have an orientation behaviour that prevents it  from being taken too far into the arid inland, a trait that could be highly adaptive in this  environment. The two IMRs were operational for more than 85% of scheduled time  during the study period and provided a wealth of information of potential value for  locust management and migration research</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radar</field><field name="subject">Insects</field><field name="subject">Migration</field><field name="subject">IMR</field><field name="subject">Migratory locust</field><field name="subject">Plague locust</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38923</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the role of internally generated risks in complex projects</field><field name="creator">Barber, Richard, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Projects are important to society, and yet they often fail. This is despite the application of widely accepted project management standards, training, and processes. In this context, there is growing awareness that projects are often highly complex and therefore cannot be managed effectively solely by using process-based project management techniques. An alternative approach is now emerging, and that is recognising and dealing with the dynamic complexity, feedback and uncertainty inherent in most large projects today. When a project does fail, it follows that there has also been a failure in the management of risks to the project. Given this, it is possible to obtain insight into failures in complex projects by investigating how risk is managed. During this research, the management of internally generated risks in projects was of particular interest. These are the risks that projects create for themselves by the way they are set up or operate. If it is established that such risks are common, important and not well managed, it could provide valuable insight into why projects fail. Nine complex projects were investigated to identify, document and analyse internally generated risks to their success. Using data gathered from workshops and confidential interviews, five hypotheses were tested to understand the role played by internally generated risks in projects. A key part of the research method was the use of risk maps, an adapted form of cause-and-effect diagrams, as the basis for the dialogue necessary to create a shared understanding of each risk. Statistically significant results were obtained to support the conclusion that internally generated risks are common in complex projects, have the potential to significantly impact upon project success, and yet are generally poorly managed. It was also concluded that internally generated risks are important as a class of project risk, with potentially large impacts upon the success or otherwise of complex projects. Given this, further research to better understand how such risks arise and how they can be recognised and managed is appropriate.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Complex projects</field><field name="subject">Risk management</field><field name="subject">Project management</field><field name="subject">Internally generated risk</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finding the shipboard relative position of a rotary wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with ultasonic ranging</field><field name="creator">Gleeson, Jeremy, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Simple, cheap and reliable echo-based ultrasonic ranging systems such as the Polaroid ranging unit are easily applied to indoor applications. However, to measure the range between an unmanned helicopter and a moving ship deck at sea using ultrasound requires a more robust ranging system, because rushing air and breaking water are known ultrasound noise sources. The work of designing, constructing and testing such a system is described in this dissertation. The compact, UAV ready ultrasound transmitter module provides high power, broadband arbitrary signal generation. The separate field-ready receiver is based on a modern embedded Digital Signal Processor (DSP), providing high speed matched-filter correlation processing.  Large time-bandwidth signalling is employed to maximise the signal to noise ratio of the ranging system. Synthesised experiments demonstrate the ability of the correlation processing to reliably recover timing from signals buried in noise.  Real world experiments demonstrate decimetre accuracy with two centimetre resolution, ten metre range and 32Hz refresh rate. A maximum boresight range of up to 38m is supported.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aids to air navigation.</field><field name="subject">Drone aircraft  control systems</field><field name="subject">Ultrasonic equipment.</field><field name="subject">Digital signal processor (DSP)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38978</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An online and adaptive signature-based approach for intrusion detection using learning classifier systems</field><field name="creator">Shafi, Kamran, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the case of dynamically and adaptively learning signatures for network intrusion detection using genetic based machine learning techniques. The two major criticisms of the signature based intrusion detection systems are their i) reliance on domain experts to handcraft intrusion signatures and ii) inability to detect previously unknown attacks or the attacks for which no signatures are available at the time. In this thesis, we present a biologically-inspired computational approach to address these two issues. This is done by adaptively learning maximally general rules, which are referred to as signatures, from network traffic through a supervised learning classifier system, UCS. The rules are learnt dynamically (i.e., using machine intelligence and without the requirement of a domain expert), and adaptively (i.e., as the data arrives without the need to relearn the complete model after presenting each data instance to the current model). Our approach is hybrid in that signatures for both intrusive and normal behaviours are learnt. The rule based profiling of normal behaviour allows for anomaly detection in that the events not matching any of the rules are considered potentially harmful and could be escalated for an action. We study the effect of key UCS parameters and operators on its performance and identify areas of improvement through this analysis. Several new heuristics are proposed that improve the effectiveness of UCS for the prediction of unseen and extremely rare intrusive activities. A signature extraction system is developed that adaptively retrieves signatures as they are discovered by UCS. The signature extraction algorithm is augmented by introducing novel subsumption operators that minimise overlap between signatures. Mechanisms are provided to adapt the main algorithm parameters to deal with online noisy and imbalanced class data. The performance of UCS, its variants and the signature extraction system is measured through standard evaluation metrics on a publicly available intrusion detection dataset provided during the 1999 KDD Cup intrusion detection competition. We  show that the extended UCS significantly improves test accuracy and hit rate while significantly reducing the rate of false alarms and cost per example scores than the standard UCS. The results are competitive to the best systems participated in the competition in addition to our systems being online and incremental rule learners. The signature extraction system built on top of the extended UCS retrieves a magnitude smaller rule set than the base UCS learner without any significant performance loss. We extend the evaluation of our systems to real time network traffic which is captured from a university departmental server. A methodology is developed to build fully labelled intrusion detection dataset by mixing real background traffic with attacks simulated in a controlled environment. Tools are developed to pre-process the raw network data into feature vector format suitable for UCS and other related machine learning systems. We show the effectiveness of our feature set in detecting payload based attacks.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Classification</field><field name="subject">Intrusion detection</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary computation</field><field name="subject">Data mining</field><field name="subject">Genetic based machine learning</field><field name="subject">Supervised learning</field><field name="subject">Learning classifier system</field><field name="subject">Knowledge extraction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38991</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imaging techniques through the atmosphere</field><field name="creator">Tahtali, Murat, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Whilst the underlying mechanisms of atmospheric turbulence are complex, the observed effects on imaging can be described in simpler terms. In this thesis, I address the effects seen as geometric distortions in anisoplanatic imaging and propose new digital restorations techniques that are real-time capable and predictive. The anisoplanatic problem arises in wide-field telescopic imaging and in new ventures of astronomy such as giant telescopes that process wide-field imagery. The methods proposed here, both digital and digital-optical hybrid, remove the position dependent distortions as a precursor to image analysis. Previous existing digital restoration techniques have used a prototype formed by averaging an image time sequence for image registration where valuable high frequencies information is lost due to the low-pass filtering effect of averaging. The proposed techniques are capable of using any arbitrary frame in the sequence as prototype, thus circumventing the low pass filtering effect and also allowing real-time implementation. Furthermore, these techniques are made predictive by the use of Kalman filtering. The predictive capabilities of these techniques open a new path to the combination of digital processing and adaptive optics that can result in hybrid systems. The key to adoption of hybrid systems is to reduce the complexity and expense of the optics and couple this with digital processing prediction. To this end I also propose a new type of inexpensive and fast piezoelectric deformable mirror based on the vibration modes of circular PVDF membranes that exhibit striking similarities to Zernike polynomials. It requires only two electrodes for actuation and a very simple driving signal generator, therefore constituting an inexpensive and viable alternative to existing deformable mirrors. With the emergence of multi-conjugate adaptive optics (MCAO) and multiobject adaptive optics (MOAO) in astronomy, and the more demanding correction required for long range surveillance imaging, this inexpensive deformable mirror and the real-time capable digital algorithms are promising building blocks for a hybrid solution to the anisoplanatic imaging problem.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Image processing</field><field name="subject">Imaging systems</field><field name="subject">Atmospheric turbulence</field><field name="subject">Warped frames</field><field name="subject">Warping</field><field name="subject">Mirrors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38963</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolving complexity towards risk : a massive scenario generation approach for evaluating advanced air traffic management concepts</field><field name="creator">Alam, Sameer, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Present day air traffc control is reaching its operational limits and accommodating future traffic growth will be a challenging task for air traffic service providers and airline operators. Free Flight is a proposed transition from a highly-structured and centrally-controlled air traffic system to a self-optimized and highly-distributed system. In Free Flight, pilots will have the flexibility of real-time trajectory planning and dynamic route  optimization given airspace constraints (traffic, weather etc.). A variety of advanced air  traffc management (ATM) concepts are proposed as enabling technologies for the realization of Free Flight. Since these concepts can be exposed to unforeseen and challenging  scenarios in Free Flight, they need to be validated and evaluated in order to implement  the most effective systems in the field.  Evaluation of advanced ATM concepts is a challenging task due to the limitations in the  existing scenario generation methodologies and limited availability of a common platform  (air traffic simulator) where diverse ATM concepts can be modeled and evaluated. Their  rigorous evaluation on safety metrics, in a variety of complex scenarios, can provide an  insight into their performance, which can help improve upon them while developing new  ones.  In this thesis, I propose a non-propriety, non-commercial air traffic simulation system,  with a novel representation of airspace, which can prototype advanced ATM concepts  such as conflict detection and resolution, airborne weather avoidance and cockpit display  of traffic information. I then propose a novel evolutionary computation methodology to  algorithmically generate a massive number of conflict scenarios of increasing complexity  in order to evaluate conflict detection algorithms.  I illustrate the methodology in detail by quantitative evaluation of three conflict detection  algorithms, from the literature, on safety metrics. I then propose the use of data mining techniques for the discovery of interesting relationships, that may exist implicitly, in  the algorithm's performance data. The data mining techniques formulate the conflict  characteristics, which may lead to algorithm failure, using if-then rules.  Using the rule sets for each algorithm, I propose an ensemble of conflict detection algorithms which uses a switch mechanism to direct the subsequent conflict probes to an  algorithm which is less vulnerable to failure in a given conflict scenario. The objective is  to form a predictive model for algorithm's vulnerability which can then be included in an  ensemble that can minimize the overall vulnerability of the system.  In summary, the contributions of this thesis are:  1. A non-propriety, non-commercial air traffic simulation system with a novel representation of airspace for efficient modeling of advanced ATM concepts.  2. An Ant-based dynamic weather avoidance algorithm for traffic-constrained enroute  airspace.  3. A novel representation of 4D air traffic scenario that allows the use of an evolutionary  computation methodology to evolve complex conflict scenarios for the evaluation of  conflict detection algorithms.  4. An evaluation framework where scenario generation, scenario evaluation and scenario evolution processes can be carried out in an integrated manner for rigorous  evaluation of advanced ATM concepts.  5. A methodology for forming an intelligent ensemble of conflict detection algorithms  by data mining the scenario space.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scenario planning</field><field name="subject">Free flight</field><field name="subject">Air traffic management</field><field name="subject">Conflict detection algorthims</field><field name="subject">Learning classifier systems</field><field name="subject">Weather avoidance</field><field name="subject">Genetic algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38966</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The measurement of the pressure distribution over the wing of an aircraft in flight</field><field name="creator">McCarty, Matthew, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">A measurement system has been developed for use on a light aircraft to measure  the pressure distribution over the wing surfaces. The measurement system was  developed as a low-cost alternative to existing advanced measurement systems. The system consisted of low profile, low cost pressure sensors that interfaced  digitally with microcontrollers for data acquisition. The pressure sensors and  microcontrollers were developed into self-contained sensor modules with all electronic components mounted on flexible circuit board that formed the base of the modules. Two types of module were developed; a module with a single pressure sensor and a module  with a row of seven pressure sensors at fifteen millimetre spacing. The total cost of the  sensor modules was approximately ninety dollars for a single sensor module and one  hundred and forty dollars for the seven sensor module. Studies were carried out using numerical methods to predict the pressure  distribution over a NACA2412 airfoil. The numerical studies were used to evaluate the  effect of adding the sensor modules to the wing, and the effect of the sensor distribution  on measured force coefficients. Numerical predictions were made using the XFOIL  software package. This software was validated using the Hess-Smith inviscid panel  method.  Flight testing was carried out with the pressure distribution measurement system to  confirm the operation of the system and to make preliminary measurements. The flight  testing focused on the measurement of steady state pressure distributions for  comparison with the numerical predictions. Good agreement was found between the  measured pressure distributions and the XFOIL predictions. Integration of the pressure  distributions enabled comparison of normal force, lift force and quarter chord moment  coefficients. The measured force coefficients showed the expected trends with angle of  attack although it was found that the limited number of sensor modules used caused  large error in the quarter chord moment coefficient compared to the numerical  predictions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pressure sensors</field><field name="subject">Aerodynamics</field><field name="subject">Pressure measurement  instruments</field><field name="subject">Airplane wing surfaces.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temporal motion models for video mosaicing and synthesis</field><field name="creator">Owen, Michael, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Video compression aims to reduce video file size without impacting visual quality.  Existing algorithms mostly use transform coders to convert information from the spatial  to frequency domain, and attenuate or remove high frequency components from the  sequence. This enables the omission of a large proportion of high frequency information  with no discernible visual impact. Sprite-based compression encodes large portions of a  scene as a single object in the video sequence, recreating the object in subsequent  frames by warping or morphing the sprite to mimic changes in subsequent frames. This  thesis sought to improve several aspects of existing sprite based compression  approaches, employing a temporal motion model using a low order polynomial to  represent the motion of an object across multiple frames in a single model rather than a  series of models. The main outcome is the demonstration that motion models used by  sprite based video compression can be extended to a full three dimensional model,  reducing the overall size of the model, and improving the quality of the sequence at low  bit rates. A second outcome is the demonstration that super-resolution processing is not  necessary if lanczos spatial interpolation is used instead of bilinear or bi-cubic  interpolation, resulting in a savings in computational time and resources. A third  outcome is the introduction of a new blending model used to generate image mosaics  that improves the quality of the synthesised sequence when zoom is present in the  sequence for a given bit-rate. A final outcome is demonstrating that performing superresolution  processing and sub-sampling back to the original resolution prior to  compression provides benefits in some circumstances.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Video compression</field><field name="subject">Image processing</field><field name="subject">Sprite-based compression</field><field name="subject">Temporal motion model</field><field name="subject">Superresolution  processing</field><field name="subject">Video mosaicing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living with information :  the household as a negotiated information system : an exploratory study</field><field name="creator">Kalms, Bryan, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The household has always been a place of information consumption. While  much is known about the modern household as a consumer of information  and adopter of information-related technologies, virtually nothing is known  about how the household -as a collectivity - processes and manages its information. This research represents the first systematic study of the  household as a human information system and presents an understandingtype  theory of household information practices.  Using dimensional analysis (including theoretical sampling) as proposed by  Schatzman (1991), the information practices of eleven households (28  householders) were explored. Each householder completed a questionnaire  to identify the information and information-related devices and services used  in the household. This was followed by an unstructured group interview that  explored the information practices in the household.  Analysis of the questionnaires and interviews revealed that within a  household it is individual householders who process and manage  information. They do so because information has a role in their life, that is,  particular information is meaningful for them. Each householder thus  devises their own individual information practices, representing the unique  way in which a householder comes to live with information.  Household information practices are the sum of these individual information  practices. They are mediated by two enabling processes - taking charge and  negotiating - and nine dimensions of action. Six of the dimensions affect the  information practices of individual householders - which are themselves a  dimension - while the final two represent, respectively, the consequences of  living with and without information. All processes and dimensions operate  against, and interact with, a changing structural context of information,  technology and society. As a result, each household has a characteristic mode  for dealing with information.  The centrality of negotiation in developing household information practices  indicates that the practices are socially constructed and represent an  emergent phenomenon. This, in turn, suggests that the household as an  information system is a negotiated order.  Insights from the research can be applied to other types of organisations and  other aspects of the Information Systems discipline. Areas of further work  are identified to expand upon the exploratory nature of this research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information systems.</field><field name="subject">Human information processing.</field><field name="subject">Household research.</field><field name="subject">Information resources management.</field><field name="subject">Information management.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39184</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intelligent adaptive control for nonlinear applications</field><field name="creator">Ali, Shaaban, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis deals with the design and implementation of an Adaptive Flight Control technique for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The application of UAVs has been increasing exponentially in the last decade both in Military and Civilian fronts. These UAVs fly at very low speeds and Reynolds numbers, have nonlinear coupling, and tend to exhibit time varying characteristics. In addition, due to the variety of missions, they fly in uncertain environments exposing themselves to unpredictable external disturbances.  The successful completion of the UAV missions is largely dependent on the accuracy of the control provided by the flight controllers. Thus there is a necessity for accurate and robust flight controllers. These controllers should be able to adapt to the changes in the dynamics due to internal and external changes. From the available literature, it is known that, one of the better suited adaptive controllers is the model based controller. The design and implementation of model based adaptive controller is discussed in the thesis.  A critical issue in the design and application of model based control is the online identification of the UAV dynamics from the available sensors using the onboard processing capability. For this, proper instrumentation in terms of sensors and avionics for two platforms developed at UNSW@ADFA is discussed. Using the flight data from the remotely flown platforms, state space identification and fuzzy identification are developed to mimic the UAV dynamics. Real time validations using Hardware in Loop (HIL) simulations show that both the methods are feasible for control. A finer comparison showed that the accuracy of identification using fuzzy systems is better than the state space technique. The flight tests with real time online identification confirmed the feasibility of fuzzy identification for intelligent control. Hence two adaptive controllers based on the fuzzy identification are developed.  The first adaptive controller is a hybrid indirect adaptive controller that utilises the model sensitivity in addition to output error for adaptation. The feedback of the model sensitivity function to adapt the parameters of the controller is shown to have beneficial effects, both in terms of convergence and accuracy. HIL simulations applied to the control of roll stabilised pitch autopilot for a typical UAV demonstrate the improvements compared to the direct adaptive controller.  Next a novel fuzzy model based inversion controller is presented. The analytical approximate inversion proposed in this thesis does not increase the computational effort. The comparisons of this controller with other controller for a benchmark problem are presented using numerical simulations. The results bring out the superiority of this technique over other techniques. The extension of the analytical inversion based controller for multiple input multiple output problem is presented for the design of roll stabilised pitch autopilot for a UAV. The results of the HIL simulations are discussed for a typical UAV.  Finally, flight test results for angle of attack control of one of the UAV platforms at UNSW@ADFA are presented. The flight test results show that the adaptive controller is capable of controlling the UAV suitably in a real environment, demonstrating its robustness characteristics.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adaptive flight control</field><field name="subject">Adaptive control systems testing</field><field name="subject">Drone aircraft</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39185</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SEATO and the defence of Southeast Asia 1955-1965</field><field name="creator">Fenton, Damien , Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite the role played by the South East Treaty Organisation (SEATO) in the defence of Western interests in that region during the Cold War, there has to date been no scholarly attempt to examine the development and performance of the organisation as a military alliance. This thesis is thus the first attempt to do so and as such seeks to take advantage of the recent release of much SEATO-related official material into the public domain by Western governments. This material throws new light upon SEATO???s aims and achievements, particularly in regard to the first ten years of its existence. Because SEATO was eventually rendered irrelevant by the events of the Second Indochina War (1965-1975) a popular perception has arisen that it was always a ???Paper Tiger??? lacking in substance, and thus easily dismissed. This thesis challenges this assumption by examining SEATO???s development in the decade before that conflict.  The thesis analyses SEATO???s place in the wider Cold War and finds that it was part of a rational and consistent response within the broader Western strategy of containment to deter, and if need be, defeat, the threat of communist aggression. That threat was a very real one for Southeast Asia in the aftermath of the First Indochina War and one that was initially perceived in terms of the conventional military balance of power. This focus dominated SEATO???s strategic concepts and early contingency planning and rightly so, as an examination of the strength and development of the PLA and PAVN during this period demonstrates. SEATO developed a dedicated military apparatus, principally the Military Planning Office (MPO), that proved itself to be perfectly capable of providing the level of co-ordination and planning needed to produce a credible SEATO deterrent in this regard. SEATO enjoyed less success with its attempts to respond to the emergence of a significant communist insurgent threat, first in Laos then in South Vietnam, but the alliance did nonetheless recognise this threat and the failure of SEATO in this regard was one of political will rather than military doctrine. Indeed this thesis confirms that it was the increasingly disparate political agendas of a number of SEATO???s members that ultimately paralysed its ability to act and thus ensured its failure to meet its aims, at least insofar as the so-called ???Protocol States??? were concerned. But this failure should not be allowed to completely overshadow SEATO???s earlier achievements in providing a modicum of Western-backed stability and security to the region from 1955-1965.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">World Politics, 1955-1965</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation : history</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia : foreign relations</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia : defenses</field><field name="subject">Communism : Southeast Asia</field><field name="subject">SEATO</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">No entry without strategy : an evaluation of UN transitional administration approaches to building the rule of law in disrupted states</field><field name="creator">Bull, Carolyn, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">As a mode of intervention in which the UN assumed direct authority over disrupted states, transitional administrations represent unique examples of ambitious state-building projects. This thesis investigates the apparent failure of transitional administrations to establish the rule of law in Cambodia, Kosovo and East Timor. It identifies nine explanatory factors which are tested against each case study. In addition, it seeks to enhance conceptual understandings of the UN???s state-building agenda and to add to empirical studies regarding attempts by external actors to establish the rule of law in disrupted states. Three findings emerge. First, in each case, UN transitional administrations failed in each of the following ways: to make the best use of their mandate; to establish effective state justice institutions; to build local commitment to the rule of law as a value system; to promote social relationships supportive of the rule of law; to ensure sufficient state capacity post-intervention; to maintain adequate levels of security; to address the existence of informal justice structures; to deal with the legacies of the past; and to ensure an adequate level of mission performance. Of these, establishing effective state justice institutions, building local commitment and addressing informal justice structures proved most crucial. Second, the state-based ???enforcement??? approach adopted by transitional administrations proved ineffective. Enacting laws and establishing coercive state structures such as judicial, police and prison services were critical to, but could not be equated with the rule of law. This approach did not account sufficiently for the importance of entrenched informal justice institutions, of the voluntary consent of local actors, or of appropriate institutional design choices. As a result, it did not offer real solutions to real problems faced by local actors. Finally, the UN failed to consider fully how to create an enabling ???space??? in which internal processes of change could occur, to engage appropriately with local actors, to overcome the tyrannies of truncated deployment, or to address these issues at the ???front-end??? of the mission. This ???entry without strategy??? approach to state-building seriously undermined the UN???s ability to establish the rule of law, as the self-declared touchstone of its state-building agenda.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">United Nations : Transitional Authority in Cambodia</field><field name="subject">United Nations : Transitional Administration in East Timor</field><field name="subject">United Nations Interim Mission in Kosovo</field><field name="subject">Nation-building</field><field name="subject">Rule of law</field><field name="subject">NATO</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust decentralised output feedback control of interconnected grid system</field><field name="creator">Athanasius, Germane, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The novel contribution of the thesis is the design and implementation of decentralised  output feedback power system controllers for power oscillation damping (POD) over  the entire operating regime of the power system. The POD controllers are designed for the linearised models of the nonlinear power system dynamics. The linearised  models are combined and treated as parameter varying switched systems. The thesis contains novel results for the controller design, bumpless switching and stability analysis of such switched systems. Use of switched controllers against the present trend of having single controller helps to reduce the conservatism and to increase the uncertainty handling capability of the power system controller design. Minimax-LQG control design method is used for the controller design. Minimax-LQG control combines the advantages of both LQG and H control methods with respect to robustness and the inclusion of uncertainty and noise in the controller design. Also, minimax-LQG control allows the use of multiple integral quadratic constraints to bound the different types of uncertainties in the power system application. During switching between controllers, switching stability of the system is guaranteed by constraining the minimum time between two consecutive switchings. An expression is developed to compute the minimum time required between switchings including the effect of jumps in the states. Bumpless switching scheme is used to minimise the switching transients which occur when the controllers are switched. Another contribution of the thesis is to include the effect of on load tap changing transformers in the power system controller design. A simplified power system model linking generator and tap changing transformer dynamics is developed for this purpose and included in the controller design. The performance of the proposed linear controllers are validated by nonlinear computer simulations and through real time digital simulations.

A virtual network of overlay nodes can be used to regulate traffic flows of an underlay network, without modifying the underlay network infrastructure. As a result, an opportunity to redeem the inefficiency of IP routing and to improve end-to-end performance of the Internet has arisen, by routing traffic over multiple overlay paths. However, to achieve high end-to-end performance over the Internet by means of overlay networks, a number of challenging issues, including limited knowledge of the underlay network characteristics, fluctuations of overlay path performance, and interactions between overlay and the underlay traffic must be addressed. This thesis provides solutions to some of these issues, by proposing a framework to construct a multi-path overlay architecture for improving Internet end-to-end performance and availability. The framework is formed by posing a series of questions, including i) how to model and forecast overlay path performance characteristics; ii) how to route traffic optimally over multiple overlay paths; and iii) how to place overlay nodes to maximally leverage the Internet resource redundancy, while minimizing the deployment cost. To answer those research questions, analytical and experimental studies have been conducted. As a result, i) a loss model and a hybrid forecasting technique are proposed to capture, and subsequently predict end-to-end loss/delay behaviors; with this predictive capability, overlay agents can, for example, select overlay paths that potentially offer good performance and reliability; ii) to take full advantage of the predictive capability and the availability of multiple paths, a Markov Decision Process based multi-path traffic controller is developed, which can route traffic simultaneously over multiple overlay paths to optimize some performance measures, e.g. average loss rate and latency. As there can be multiple overlay controllers, competing for common resources by making selfish decisions, which could jeopardize performance of the networks, game theory is applied here to turn the competition into cooperation; as a consequence, the network performance is improved;   iii) furthermore, to facilitate the deployment of the multi-path overlay architecture, a multi-objective genetic-based algorithm is introduced to place overlay nodes to attain a high level of overlay path diversity, while minimizing the number of overlay nodes to be deployed, and thus reducing the deployment cost. The findings of this thesis indicate that the use of multiple overlay paths can substantially improve end-to-end performance. They uncover the potential of multi-path application-layer overlay networks as an architecture for achieving high end-to-end performance and availability over the Internet.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer network architectures</field><field name="subject">Internet programming</field><field name="subject">Computer network protocols</field><field name="subject">Algorithms :  Computer programs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring a mine-influenced environment in Indonesia through radar polarimetry</field><field name="creator">Trisasongko, Bambang, Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Although remotely sensed data have been employed to assess various environmental problems, relatively few previous studies have focused on the impacts of mining. In Indonesia, mining activities have increasingly become one of major drivers of land cover change. The majority of remote sensing research projects on mining environments have exploited optical data which are frequently complicated by tmospheric disturbance, especially in tropical territories. Active remote sensors such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are invaluable in this case. Monitoring by Independent SAR data has been limited due to single polarisation. Dual-polarised data have been employed considerably, although for some forestry applications the data were found insufficient to retrieve basic information. This Masters thesis is devoted to assess fully polarimetric SAR data for environmental monitoring of the tailings deposition zone of the PT Freeport Indonesia Grasberg mine in Papua, Indonesia. The main data were two granules of the AIRSAR datasets acquired during the PACRIM-II campaign. To support the interpretation and analysis, a scene of Landsat ETM  February 2001) was used, juxtaposed with classified aerial photographs and a series of SPOT VEGETATION images. Both backscattering information and complex  coherence matrices, as common representations of polarimetric data, were studied.  Primary applications of this research were on degraded forest and environmental rehabilitation. Most parts of Indonesian forests have experienced abrupt changes as an impact of clear-cut deforestation. Gradual changes such as those due to fire or flooded tailings, however, are least studied. It was shown that the Cloude-Pottier polarimetric decomposition provided a convenient way to interpret various stages of forest disturbance. The result suggested that the Entropy parameter of the Cloude-Pottier decomposition could be used as a disturbance indicator.  Using the fully polarimetric dataset combined with Support Vector Machine learning, the outcomes were generally acceptable. It was possible to improve classification accuracy by incorporating decomposition parameters, although it seemed insignificant. Land rehabilitation on tailings deposits has been a central concern of the government and the mining operator. Indigenous plant pioneers such as reeds (Phragmites) can naturally grow on dry tailings where soil structure is fairly well developed. To assist such efforts, a part of this research involved identification of dry tailings. On the first assessment, interpretation of surface scatterers was aided by polarimetric signatures. Apparently, longer wavelengths such as L- and P-band were overpenetrated; hence, growing reeds on dry tailings were less detectable. In this case, the use of C-band data was found fairly robust. Employing Mahalanobis statistics, the combination of HH and VV performed well on classification, having similar accuracy with quad polarimetric data. Extension on previous results was made through the Freeman-Durden decomposition. Interpretation using a three-component image of odd, even bounce and volume scattering showed that dry and wet tailings could be well distinguished. The application was benefited from unique responses of dielectric materials in the tailings deposit on SAR signals; hence it is possible to discriminate tailings with different moisture levels. However, further assessment of tailings moisture was not possible due to security reasons and access limitations at the study site.  Fully polarimetric data were also employed to support rehabilitation of stressed mangrove forest on the southern coast. In this case, the Cloude-Pottier decomposition was employed along with textural parameters. Inclusion of textural properties was found  invaluable for the classification using various statistical trees, and more important than decomposition parameters. It was concluded that incorporating polarimetric decompositions and textural parameters into coherence matrix leads to profound accuracy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mineral industries : environmental aspects :  Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Forests and forestry : remote sensing</field><field name="subject">Forests and forestry : Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Synthetic aperture radar</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The torch and the sword :  a history of the army cadet movement in Australia 1866-2004</field><field name="creator">Stockings, Craig, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to provide a general history of the army cadet movement in  Australia from 1866 to 2004 by tracing the interactions between four fundamental forces  that have stood as its foundation for almost 140 years. In various guises military,  educational, social, and financial factors are the pillars on which the cadet movement has  always rested. Over time the balance and relative dominance of each has determined the  shape and state of the cadet organisation and will continue to do so in the future. When  these four forces have been aligned the movement has thrived but when they have pulled in  disparate directions it has faltered. Throughout the thesis, contextualising these four key  concepts, are two more general themes concerning the influence of conservative politics and a recurring state school/private school divide. The history of army cadets, and therefore  this thesis, is an investigation into the interplay of these dynamics.  With such a purpose and methodology the thesis begins by tracing the development of the movement from its nineteenth century origins by identifying issues and circumstances that led some colonies to maintain thousands of cadets while others struggled to field any. It goes on to examine the formation, five years after Federation, of a Commonwealth cadet scheme birthed only to be swamped by the era of compulsory military training in Australia from 1911-29 which saw, at its peak, almost 100,000 schoolboys in khaki. The thesis analyses the re-organised voluntary cadet system in place from 1930-38 which, matching the circumstances of the adult army, faltered in numbers and support as it was restructured into dual 'Regimental' and 'School' branches. It goes on to assess the impact of the Second World War and the renewed impetus it provided to the cadet organisation before investigating the prosperity of the movement throughout the 1950s and 1960s in spite of the complexities raised by National Service and Australian involvement in conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, Malaya and Borneo. Particular attention is paid to the early 1970s and the machinations surrounding the unexpected decision to disband the cadet organisation announced by the Labor government on 26 August 1975. The cadet story does not conclude at this point, however, with Vice Regal controversy and a subsequent Liberal-National election victory resurrecting the movement. The re-styled cadet scheme of 1976-83 is investigated followed by twelve years of division and distress under consecutive Labor federal governments between 1984-95. The thesis concludes by examining the reversal of fortunes for the movement from 1996-2004 which saw the cadet system develop, by the end of the period, into a well led, resourced and motivated organisation of almost 17,000 members. The research informing this thesis is based on documents held in National Archives of Australia offices in all state capitals, as well as those held in the Australian War Memorial. In addition, all state public record offices have yielded significant material, as have a wide range of private and school-based archives. More recent primary source information has been gathered from sources within the Department of Defence Archives, Queanbeyan, NSW, while select active and closed files from Headquarters Australian Army Cadets and the Directorate of Defence Force Cadets were graciously provided to the author. The study has also been informed by a wide selection of official, privately published and unpublished secondary sources spanning more than a century.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Army :  Cadet Corps : history</field><field name="subject">Military cadets : Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The origins and development of Royal Australian Naval signals intelligence in an era of imperial defence 1914-1945</field><field name="creator">Straczek, Jozef, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the origins and development of signals intelligence in the Royal Australian Navy, during the period 1914 to 1945, within the context of an Australian contribution to Imperial defence. In doing so it demonstrates how the development of this capability was shaped by national, Imperial and international forces and events. The thesis thus fills a gap in the historiography of imperial defence and of early twentieth  century signals intelligence. It also constitutes a case study of the development of a niche military capability by a small to medium power in the context of great power alliances and major historical events. The thesis is based principally upon the investigation of documents in the Australian, US and UK national archives, some of which have been newly declassified for this purpose. During the First World War the RAN undertook a minor cryptographic effort  focused on intercepting and breaking coded messages from the German Pacific Squadron.  After the War, and at the request of the RN, the RAN began to develop a signals  intelligence capability aimed at the Imperial Japanese Navy. This capability was seen as  part of the RAN contribution to Imperial defence. The commitment, made without  Australian political approval, would see the RAN conduct two covert intelligence collection operations against the Japanese Mandated Territories. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and subsequent defeat of the  Western Powers in Asia, the RAN signals intelligence organisation became, as a  consequence of agreements between Britain and the USN, part of the USN organisation  in the Pacific. At no stage however, was the RAN involved in the discussions which accompanied these arrangements nor did it have any subsequent say in the strategic direction of this capability. As a consequence, when the Pacific War was drawing to a close the future of the RAN's cryptographic organisation came in to question. By the time the Japanese surrendered this issue had still not been resolved. Beyond the history of the origins and development of signals intelligence in the RAN, and of its involvement in the signals intelligence war against Japan, the thesis highlights the importance of committed individuals in small military organisations and  how they can greatly influence the success or otherwise of these organisations. The  ability of personnel from different nations to work together in signals intelligence is  reflective of the functioning of the alliance as a whole. The development of such a niche capability by a small to medium power can  have an effect on that nation's standing, in the context of alliance relationships, as it did  in this case. As the RAN found however, such capabilities do not provide for automatic  access to strategic decision making within an alliance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Imperial defence : international cooperation.</field><field name="subject">Royal Australian Navy : signals intelligence</field><field name="subject">Signals intelligence : history</field><field name="subject">World War I : cryptography</field><field name="subject">World  War II : cryptography</field><field name="subject">Signals and signaling</field><field name="subject">Military intelligence : international cooperation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of technology and command on No 1 Squadron operations 1916-1958</field><field name="creator">Lax, Mark, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Flying Squadrons are the very substance of an air force. By its nature, the air service is a highly technical one requiring both complex machinery and sound human judgement to function at its peak. The smallest independent unit of an air force is the squadron. Squadrons have a discrete status which makes them ideal candidates for in-depth study. This thesis examines the impact of technology and command on a single squadron's operations because technology and command have been and will remain pivotal in determining the success or failure of the air service. Although the Australian No 1 Squadron has existed almost continually from 1916 to the present, this thesis only examines a specific period of its life. The period 1916-1958 was chosen since the squadron formed as an independent Australian Flying Corps unit in January 1916, served in both World Wars and the Malayan Emergency, returning to Australia to resume domestic operations and training in 1958. Of significance to the work, during the specified period, the Squadron was controlled by both the Army and Air Force, by both the British and Australian Governments, had successes and failures and was an operational and a training unit. The Squadron has thus mirrored the growth and changes experienced by the developing Air Force as a whole. The main purpose of examining such a squadron is that it provides an insight into the development and thinking of the RAAF and highlights pitfalls evidenced in technological and command problems which still plague military staff today. In examining the operations and operational effectiveness of No 1 Squadron, three determinants have been specifically examined: technology, that is the aircraft flown, the commanding officer's personality and his methods and the organisational structure under which the Unit operated. Naturally, all three matured as doctrine, knowledge and experience also matured. The Thesis concludes that when the Squadron is winning, it is generally technology that creates the relative advantage and when loosing, strong leadership in the form of command must come to the fore. The results obtained support the thesis in keeping with contemporary RAAF doctrine, that technology and command strongly impact squadron operations and hence, operational effectiveness.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Royal Australian Air Force : effect of technological innovations.</field><field name="subject">Royal Australian Air Force : No. 1 Squadron</field><field name="subject">Royal Australian Air Force :  Management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Australian's in Greece and Crete : a study of an intimate wartime relationship</field><field name="creator">Hill, Maria, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Historians have largely ignored the importance of relationships in war, particularly at a grass roots level. Examining the past from a relational point of view provides a new perspective on war not accessible through other forms of analysis. A relational approach to a study of the campaigns in Greece and Crete helps to explain, amongst other issues, why so many Australian lives were saved.  Australians entered Greece with little background knowledge of the country and the people they were required to defend. There was no serious consultation with the Australian government apart from the cursory briefing of its Prime Minister. Although Britain had numerous intelligence officers operating on the ground in Greece prior and during the campaign, little information about the true political situation in the country had filtered through to the Australian high command. This placed the troops in a very vulnerable position on the Greek frontier and, later, on Crete.  Military interaction with the Greeks proved difficult, as key officers from the Greek General Staff and senior government ministers did not intend to fight the Germans. As a result, little coordination took place between the Australian and Greek forces hindering the development of a successful working relationship. Conversely, relations with the Greek people were very amicable with many Greeks risking their lives to help Australian troops.  The altruism of the Greeks was one of the most striking features of the Greek and Crete campaigns. Unlike Egypt, where the Australians felt alienated by the values and customs of the Egyptian people, in Greece they warmed to the behaviour of the Greeks. Although they did not speak the same language nor share a similar culture, they had many characteristics in common with the Greeks whose strong sense of loyalty to their allies really impressed the Australians. On their part, the Australians displayed respect for the values and customs of the Greek people.  Through their interaction during the war, the Greeks came to regard the Australians, not only as friends, but also as brothers, forging an intimate relationship that has been incorporated in the social memory of both countries.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian and Greece : Foreign Relations</field><field name="subject">World War, 1939-1945 : Campaigns : Greece</field><field name="subject">Australia and Greece :  Military Relations</field><field name="subject">Australian Army : Serving in Greece</field><field name="subject">Australian politics 1941-1945..</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40076</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ASEAN's Security Community Project : Challenges and Opportunities in the Pursuit of Comprehensive Integration</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Christopher B., Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">In October 2003, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) proposed the establishment of a security, economic and socio-cultural community by the year 2020. Given that initiators of the ASEAN proposal were informed by the scholarly literature on the concept of a 'security community', this dissertation develops and then tests the concept in relation to the ASEAN states. Here, the concept of a 'security community' is understood as 'a transnational grouping of two or more states whose sovereignty is increasingly amalgamated and whose people maintain dependable expectations of peaceful change'. The application of the 'security community framework' developed in this study is necessary  to provide a conceptual basis for critically assessing the major factors that could potentially impede ASEAN's evolution towards a security community. For the purpose of such an assessment, the study provides a detailed investigation of the most significant historical issues and contemporary security challenges that inform the nature of inter-state relations in Southeast Asia. As a complement to this approach, the dissertation incorporates the analysis of data obtained from extensive fieldwork in all ten of the ASEAN states involving over 100 in-depth interviews and two survey designs (one at the elite level and another at the communal level) involving 919 participants. While the survey work, especially at the communal level, is best considered a pilot study and the results are therefore to be considered as indicative, the research nevertheless represents the first empirical assessment of regional perceptions of trust, intra-mural relations, security, economic  integration, and liberalisation and of a broad range of other factors relevant to the analysis. The interview data has also been invaluable in uncovering previously unpublished information and in contextualising the analysis. Despite a considerable strengthening of the region's security architecture since ASEAN's formation, the ten chapters in the study reveal that the Association has a long way to travel before it will satisfy the defining criteria of a security community. The region lacks a common sense of community and consequently the level of trust between the Southeast Asian states remains problematic. The political elite continue to engage in episodes of competitive behaviour, have been unable to resolve territorial disputes, and thus the continued potential for armed conflict undermines the prospect for 'dependable expectations of peaceful change'. Therefore, ASEAN's evolution towards the status of a security community, if it proceeds further, will likely occur over the course of many decades rather than by ASEAN's current goal of 2015.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">National security : Southeast Asia.</field><field name="subject">ASEAN</field><field name="subject">ASEAN countries : Strategic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia :  Foreign relations.</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia :  Politics and government</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40261</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magnetic resonance studies of issues critical to solid state quantum computer</field><field name="creator">Suwuntanasarn, Nakorn, Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The spins of phosphorus doped in silicon are potential candidates for a quantum  computing device, with models based on the use of nuclear and/or electron spins suggested.  For a quantum computing device, several essential criteria must be demonstrated  before any physical implementation, and these include qubit control gates,  long decoherence time and scalability. Scalability and compatibility with existing  fabrication technologies are strong points in favour of a silicon based system. For  spin based schemes, silicon has the potential to provide a host with zero nuclear spin  (isotopically purifed 28Si) and also the phosphorus donor provides both nuclear and  electron half integer spins (ideal case). In this work, a magnetic resonance method  (electron spin resonance) was utilised to investigate these critical issues (controllable  quantum gates and decoherence time) for the electron spins of phosphorus donors  in silicon.  Electron spin resonance (ESR) studies of an ensemble of phosphorus electron  spins in silicon were conducted via both continuous wave and pulsed methods. For  pulsed ESR operations, two low temperature (4 K and millikelvin) X-band pulsed  ESR systems were built. They were designed especially to suit Si:P decoherence  time measurements. The design, modelling, construction and evaluation of the  probe heads are described. With the aid of computer simulations, the performance  of the probe heads was optimised and a rectangular loop gap resonator was found  to be the most suitable for wafer type samples. The resonant frequency, quality  factor, and coupling coeffcient were calculated via simulation and are in reasonable  agreement with experimental results. This demonstrates the effectiveness of such  simulations as a tool for optimising the probe head performance.  A millikelvin pulsed ESR system was set up through the combination of a dilution  refrigerator, superconducting magnet and the in-house construction of a pulsed ESR  spectrometer. This novel system allows pulsed ESR experiments on an ensemble  system to be realised down to the millikelvin temperature range, hence providing  conditions considered most favourable for quantum computing studies. The use of  light in combination with the pulsed ESR systems was also explored in an endeavour  to overcome the problem of very long spin-lattice relaxation time, T1, allowing the  decoherence time to be measured more effciently. With these novel low temperature pulsed ESR units, two-pulse electron spin echo experiments were conducted on phosphorus donors in silicon (both natural silicon (natSi) and 28Si) with the phosphorus concentration in the range of 1015-  1016 P/cm3 and to lower temperatures than previously investigated. Decoherence times measured for both natSi:P and 28Si:P (with similar donor concentrations) were longer than previously reported. Discussions on several effective ways to obtain even longer Si:P decoherence times including variations to sample configurations and experimental conditions are presented. In addition to the pulsed ESR studies, the Si:P controllable quantum gate functions, A gate and J gate, were examined by the continuous wave technique via Stark shift and exchange interaction experiments respectively. Stark shift experiments on bulk samples were carried out to investigate possible manipulation of the spins by the applied electric field. Continuous wave ESR was also used to examine low energy ion implanted Si:P devices, both by single (P+) and dimer (P+2 ) implanted donors. The outcomes from these studies provide materials information useful in formulating  a strategy toward the Si:P device fabrication via the top down approach.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">K Pulsed Electron Spin Resonance Spectrometer</field><field name="subject">Solid state quantum computer</field><field name="subject">Magnetic resonance</field><field name="subject">millikelvin Pulsed Electron Spin Resonance Spectrometer</field><field name="subject">4 K probe head</field><field name="subject">Continuous Wave Electron Spin Resonance Studies of Si:P</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Employee engagement :managing the relationship between employees and the organisation: a validated measure and model</field><field name="creator">O'Reilly, Genevieve</field><field name="description">This thesis contributes to engagement literature by clarifying what engagement is for employees in a large Australian travel retail organisation, how it can be measured, and the expected benefits for both employees and the organisation. With claims that disengagement costs the Australian economy over $30 billion annually (Hooper, 2006), the focus on engagement, particularity within the practitioner community, has grown exponentially. However, there is a lack of empirical research providing construct definition and measurement, ensuring credibility of this construct (Saks, 2006). The two main purposes of this study aimed to address this research gap by firstly producing a valid engagement survey which measured engagement and its predictors, and secondly producing a statistically tested engagement model which explained engagement, its antecedents, and consequences. The study was conducted using a mixed methods sequential design involving three projects.   Project one involved the collection and analysis of 3 forms of qualitative data from which 12 main engagement themes were established and survey items generated. Document analysis, participant observation, and interviews (26) of current and former employees all served to identify themes and contextualize engagement within the organisation under study.  Project two involved the development and testing of the initial engagement survey. Survey items were refined through a pilot study. The remaining items were reviewed by an expert panel, before being administered company wide returning 419 completed surveys. Exploratory factor analysis was used to refine the survey items and identify the engagement construct structure.  Project three involved the validation of the engagement survey and confirmation of the engagement model. Structural equation modelling was used for this purpose. The engagement survey, which included eight driver subscales and an engagement subscale, was validated. Factors measured within the survey were similar to others cited in the literature signalling potential survey generalizability. The engagement model which included causal links between engagement, its drivers (antecedents), and outcomes (consequences) was confirmed. As anticipated, all eight engagement drivers (senior leadership, team leadership, work demands, work support, employee empowerment, continuation, customer focus and financial rewards) functioned as positive predictors of engagement. However, mixed results were found concerning engagement outcome variables. Engagement showed a positive causal relationship with personal outcomes (continuance commitment), but a negative casual relationship with organisational outcomes (customer satisfaction, and company financials). Such results question an overwhelming theme within the literature which claims a positive casual effect of engagement for both personal and organisational outcomes. Further investigation is recommended to clarify these results and explore the possibility of other variable influences. The research of this thesis incorporated both consultancy and academic literature, marrying both perspectives to produce a measure and model relevant to each orientation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Employee motivation</field><field name="subject">Management Employee participation.</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management (0454)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/13</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational learning, innovation and performance in family-controlled manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Australia</field><field name="creator">Dharmadasa, Pradeep</field><field name="description">Organisational learning has been identified as a lasting source of competitive advantage in uncertain environments. Plentiful research has highlighted that knowledge and skills and the capabilities they develop are strategic resources and that effective utilisation of these resources enhances firm innovation and performance. However, in spite of this widespread recognition, family businesses, specifically family SMEs, have not been the subject of previous research exploring the strategic impact of organisational learning on innovation and firm performance. This research, therefore, sets out a theoretical framework drawing upon organisational learning theory and innovation, and explores the strategic links between organisational learning, innovation and firm performance &#8220;within&#8221; family SMEs and &#8220;between&#8221; family and non-family SMEs.  The study was undertaken in an Australian context using a sample of 222 manufacturing SMEs comprised of 104 family and 118 non-family SMEs. The data were obtained from the Business Longitudinal Survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics over the financial years 1995/96 - 1997/98, which provides the most recent available comprehensive longitudinal dataset of SMEs in Australia.  The study involved three constructs: organisational learning, innovation and firm performance. Organisational learning was operationalised using commitment to learning, shared vision, and networking. To measure commitment to learning, three variables, employee training, management development, and comparison of performance were used. Shared vision was measured using the presence of formal planning in the firms. Networking was measured using the existence of external networks. The innovation construct was measured using product and process innovation intensity, and firm performance was measured by growth of sales and rate of return on total assets.  Data were analysed using two tests: regression analysis and the Chow test. Whereas the former test was conducted to explore the direct and indirect effects of organisational learning on innovation and firm performance &#8220;within&#8221; family SMEs, the latter was conducted to compare those effects &#8220;between&#8221; family and non-family SMEs.  Our &#8220;within&#8221; results, concerning the direct effects of organisational learning on innovation found that network relationships positively influenced innovation in family SMEs. With regard to the direct effects of organisational learning on performance, we found that management development and formal planning were positively linked with family SMEs&#8217; performance. Moreover, relating to innovation and firm performance, our research concludes that innovation in family SMEs is positively linked with their performance. In the case of the indirect effect, we found that networks affect firm performance via innovation. With respect to the &#8220;between&#8221; results, we found that whereas the effects of formal planning and innovation on firm performance of family SMEs were stronger than for non-family SMEs, the effects of employee training and management development on firm performance were stronger in non-family SMEs.

Taranaki, New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Earth Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Turner, Michael Bruce</field><field name="description">Realistic probabilistic hazard forecasts for re-awakening volcanoes rely on making an accurate estimation of their past eruption frequency and magnitude for a period long enough to view systematic changes or evolution. Adding an in-depth knowledge of the local underlying magmatic or tectonic driving processes allows development of even more robust eruption forecasting models. Holocene tephra records preserved within lacustrine sediments and soils on and surrounding the andesitic stratovolcano of Mt. Taranaki (Egmont Volcano), New Zealand, were used to 1) compile an eruption catalogue that minimises bias to carry out frequency analysis, and 2) identify magmatic processes responsible for variations in activity of this intermittently awakening volcano. A new, highly detailed eruption history for Mt. Taranaki was compiled from sediment sequences containing Holocene tephra layers preserved beneath Lakes Umutekai and Rotokare, NE and SE of the volcano&#8217;s summit, respectively, with age control provided by radiocarbon dating. To combine the two partly concurrent tephra records both geochemistry (on titanomagnetite) and statistical measures of event concurrence were applied. Similarly, correlation was made to proximal pyroclastic sequences in all sectors around the 2518 m-high edifice. This record was used to examine geochemical variations (through titanomagnetite and bulk chemistry) at Mt. Taranaki in unprecedented sampling detail. To develop an unbiased sampling of eruption event frequency, a technique was developed to distinguish explosive, pumice-forming eruptions from dome-forming events recorded in medial ash as fine-grade ash layers. Recognising that exsolution lamellae in titanomagnetite result from oxidation processes within lava domes or plugs, their presence within ash deposits was used to distinguish falls elutriated from blockand- ash flows. These deposits are focused in particular catchments and are hence difficult to sample comprehensively. Excluding these events from temporal eruption records, the remaining, widespread pumice layers of sub-plinian eruptions at a single site of Lake Umutekai presented the lowest-bias sampling of the overall event frequency. The annual eruption frequency of Mt. Taranaki was found to be strongly cyclic with a 1500-2000 year periodicity. Titanomagnetite, glass and whole-rock chemistry of eruptives from Mt. Taranaki&#8217;s Holocene history all display distinctive compositional cycles that correspond precisely with the event frequency curve for this volcano. Furthermore, the largest known eruptions from the volcano involve the most strongly evolved magmas of their cycle and occur during the eruptive-frequency minimum, preceding the longest repose intervals known. Petrological evidence reveals a two-stage system of magma differentiation and assembly operating at Mt. Taranaki. Each of the identified 1500-2000 year cycles represent isolated magma batches that evolved at depth at the base of the crust before periodically feeding a mid-upper crustal magma storage system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eruption cycles</field><field name="subject">volcano</field><field name="subject">Mt.

The response of such walls is often strongly governed by the shear effects leading to the shear induced or brittle failure. The brittle nature of high-strength concrete poses further difficulties in obtaining ductile response from shear walls. An experimental program consisting of six high-strength concrete shear walls was carried out. Specimens were tested under inplane axial load and reversed cyclic displacements with the test parameters investigated being longitudinal reinforcement ratio, transverse reinforcement ratio and axial load. Lateral loads, lateral displacements and the strains of reinforcement in edge elements and web wall were measured. The test results showed the presence of axial load has a significant effect on the strength and ductility of the shear walls. The axially loaded wall specimens exhibited a brittle behaviour regardless of reinforcement ratio whereas the specimen with no axial load had a lower strength but higher ductility. It was also found that an increase in the longitudinal reinforcement ratio gave an increase in the failure load while an increase in the transverse reinforcement ratio had no significant effect on the strength but influenced the failure mode. A non-linear finite element program based on the crack membrane model and using smeared-fixed crack approach was developed with a new aggregate interlock model incorporated into the finite element procedure. The finite element model was corroborated by experimental results of shear panels and walls. The finite element analysis of shear wall specimens indicated that while strengths can be predicted reasonably, the stiffness of edge elements has a significant effect on the deformational results for two-dimensional analyses. Therefore, to capture the deformation of walls accurately, three-dimensional finite element analyses are required. The shear wall design provisions given in the current Australian Standard and the Building Code of American Concrete Institute were compared with the experimental results. The comparison showed that the calculated strengths based on the codes are considerably conservative, specially when there exists the axial load.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shear (Mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Concrete walls -- Testing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27467</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nanostructured materials for photoelectrochemical hydrogen production using sunlight.</field><field name="creator">Glasscock, Julie Anne, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Solar hydrogen has the potential to replace fossil fuels with a sustainable energy carrier that can be produced from sunlight and water via &amp;quotewater splitting&amp;quote. This study investigates the use of hematite (Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3) as a photoelectrode for photoelectrochemical water splitting. Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3 has a narrow indirect band-gap, which allows the utilization of a substantial fraction of the solar spectrum. However, the water splitting efficiencies for Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3 are still low due to poor absorption characteristics, and large losses due to recombination in the bulk and at the surface.  The thesis investigates the use of nanostructured composite electrodes, where thin films of Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3 are deposited onto a nanostructured metal oxide substrate, in order to overcome some of the factors that limit the water splitting efficiency of Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3.  Doped (Si, Ti) and undoped Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3 thin films were prepared using vacuum deposition techniques, and their photoelectrochemical, electrical, optical and structural properties were characterised. The doped Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3 exhibited much higher photoelectrochemical activity than the undoped material, due to an improvement of the surface transfer coefficient and some grain boundary passivation. Schottky barrier modeling of Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3 thin films showed that either the width of the depletion region or the diffusion length is the dominant parameter with a value around 30 nm, and confirmed that the surface charge transfer coefficient is small. An extensive review of the conduction mechanisms of Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3 is presented.  ZnO and SnO&amp;sub2 nanostructures were investigated as substrates for the Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3 thin films. Arrays of well-aligned high aspect ratio ZnO nanowires were optimised via the use of nucleation seeds and by restricting the lateral growth of the nanostructures.  The geometry of the nanostructured composite electrodes was designed to maximise absorption and charge transfer processes. Composite nanostructured electrodes showed lower quantum efficiencies than equivalent thin films of Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3, though a relative enhancement ofcollection of long wavelength charge carriers was observed, indicating that the nanostructured composite electrode concept is worthy of further investigation. The rate-limiting step for water splitting with Fe&amp;sub2O&amp;sub3 is not yet well understood and further investigations of the surface and bulk charge transfer properties are required in order to design electrodes to overcome specific shortcomings.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogen</field><field name="subject">photoelectrochemical water splitting</field><field name="subject">hematite</field><field name="subject">nanostructure</field><field name="subject">vacuum deposition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Qualitative and semi-quantitative modelling and simulation of the software engineering processes</field><field name="creator">Zhang, He, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Software process modelling has been identified as being a vehicle for understanding development processes, controlling development costs, duration, and achieving product quality. In recent years, software process simulation has been becoming one of the essential techniques for effectively investigating and managing software development processes. Till now, most researches focus on the quantitative aspects of process simulation and modelling. Nevertheless, purely quantitative process modelling requires a very detailed understanding and accurate measurement of the software process, which relies on reliable and precise historical data. When such data are lacking or the quality is dubious, quantitative models have to impose severe constraints that restrict the model's value. Unfortunately, these data are not readily available in most cases, especially in the organisations at low process maturity levels. In addition, software development is a highly complex, human-centred endeavour, which involves many uncertain factors in the course of development process. Facing the inherent uncertainty and contingency, though quantitative modelling employs statistic techniques, its conditional capability and underlying assumptions limit its performance on large scale problems.  As the alternatives of quantitative approaches, qualitative modelling can cope with a lack of complete knowledge, and predicts qualitative process behaviours. Furthermore, semi-quantitative modelling offers the capability of handling process uncertainty with limited knowledge, and achieves tradeoff between quantitative and qualitative approaches. However, most previous researches omitted these approaches, and the associated methods and applications are far from developed.  The main contribution of this research lies in the pioneering work on the models, methods, and applications of qualitative and semi-quantitative software process modelling and simulation, and their relations with the conventional, quantitative modelling approaches.  This dissertation produces its novelty from twofold research. Firstly, it explores methods and techniques to qualitatively and semi-quantitatively model and simulate software processes at different levels, i.e. project, portion of development process, and product evolution. Secondly, Some exclusive applications of these modelling approaches are also developed for aspects of software engineering practice. Moreover, a proposed framework integrates these approaches with typical quantitative paradigms to guide the adoption of process simulation modelling in software organisations. As a comprehensive reflection of state-of-the-art of software process simulation modelling, a systematic review is reported in this dissertation as well.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Systematic review</field><field name="subject">Software process</field><field name="subject">Modelling and simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43092</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of organisational effectiveness :  contingent coupling of human, structural and financial resources through knowledge management practices</field><field name="creator">Antoniak, Edward, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents the findings of an empirical study of the effectiveness of knowledge management practices in an environment of principal-agent and market testing conditions in the Australian Defence Organisation (ADO) during the period 2001-2005.  Using a grounded theory research approach and a longitudinal case study, the ADO's workforce planning community of practice is the focus of the study.  The research is conducted in the context of the knowledge-based view of the firm, which holds that organisational effectiveness and thus sustained competitiveness is dependant on the continual creation, application and protection of new and unique knowledge.  Pertinent knowledge management theories are reviewed and reframed in terms of loose coupling concepts, which are then used to describe the variety of knowledge creating relationships and opportunities for workforce planning that become apparent during the course of field research studies.   The impact of market testing, as a precursor to outsourcing, on the creation of new knowledge in workforce planning is examined progressively during field studies. The role of leadership in maintaining effective workforce knowledge management practices emerges as the primary category in the loose coupling analysis process.   The paper suggests that in order to sustain competitive advantage in workforce planning that is conducted in a commercial support or market testing environment, trust-based leadership and the use of appropriate knowledge management practices are necessary.  The dissertation has important implications for research and practice. Specifically, the loose coupling framework provides a focus for literature reviews in future research of knowledge management and, in terms of professional practice, the framework is developed into an aide-m??moire that can be used to enhance knowledge management practices to meet workforce planning objectives. The aide-m??moire potentially has wider application as a tool to assess the effectiveness of knowledge management within the organisation as well as informing the selection of remedial knowledge management practices.  Limitations of the paper are acknowledged and recommendations are made for further research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge management</field><field name="subject">Australian Defence Organisation management</field><field name="subject">Australian Defence Organisation employees</field><field name="subject">Organizational effectiveness</field><field name="subject">Personnel management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy and public health: an evaluation of the Sydney medically supervised injecting centre</field><field name="creator">Salmon, Allison Maree, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">While supervised injecting facilities (SIF) can be found world-wide they remain politically sensitive and controversial public health policy initiatives and several important questions pertaining to SIFs remain unanswered. What type of evidence is necessary to validate controversial public health policy initiatives such as SIFs? How much evidence is enough to support public health policy initiatives to address the health of marginalised groups in our society such as injecting drug users? This thesis presents the results of a number of studies designed to evaluate the success of the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC) against its stated objectives.  Firstly, a background to Supervised Injecting Facilities (SIFs) generally and the Sydney MSIC specifically is provided, as well as a summary of evidence of their effectiveness to date. Secondly, a descriptive study is presented which is designed to assess the success of the MSIC in attracting a target population of high-risk IDUs and its success in providing a gateway to treatment. Thirdly, evidence of community support for the MSIC is presented, as are perceptions of drug-related public amenity prior to and following Sydney MSIC establishment, based on repeat cross-sectional random surveys. Presented next are the findings of an ecological study investigating the success of the MSIC against its stated objective of decreasing overdose deaths using three different indicators. The final empirical chapter presents a prospective observational study which investigates the potential impact of MSIC utilisation on levels of public injecting drug use among a client cohort. The findings of these studies are then integrated with existing evidence relating to the effectiveness of SIFs and critically reviewed according to the hierarchy of evidence framework. Finally, a way forward in assessing the effectiveness of SIFs, and other controversial public health initiatives, is presented in the form of an alternative public health-focussed framework.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The technologisation of practice in early childhood nursing : collaborating for innovation and change</field><field name="creator">Greenfield, David, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">There is a need for research to understand change processes and knowledge management in health service organisations, and indeed public sector organisations in general. This research seeks to explain how knowledge becomes formulated and thereby mobile, and also how practice has come to be established, visibilised and thereby sustained in a specific context. Exploring practice within a health service organisation, and in particular a public health service organisation, is a particular feature of this research. The research demonstrates how collaboration becomes necessitated under pressure of enacting increasingly complex work activities, an outcome being changing practices and extended accountability relationships which enacts discipline while realising expertise.  Using an ethnographic approach, the research explores how the practice of early childhood nursing in the South Western Sydney Area Health Service became a specialised expert undertaking. The research examines how change has occurred, whereby early childhood nursing was refined from being one part of the generalist community nursing practice to being a specialised practice through the increasing technologisation of practice. The technologisation of practice refers to the artefacts, conduct and the processes through which the conceptualisation and enactment of early childhood nursing has become increasingly standardised. Through the technologisation of practice explicit knowledge becomes distributed within the artefacts for practice and tacit knowing becomes distributed across, and is continually enacted by, the collaboration of the practice community. There are four interrelated aspects to the technologisation of practice. Firstly, the technologisation of practice involves standardising the conceptualisation and enactment of practice through constructing a multi-dimensional practice resource within a community of practice. Secondly, the technologisation of practice involves the mobilisation and refinement of the multi-dimensional practice resource to realise a practice network involving extended relationships of accountability. These relationships of accountability are within a profession and also with other professionals. Thirdly, the technologisation of practice involves the ongoing enactment of accountability in a collaborative community of practice. The research shows that a team can become a collaborative community by constructing an accountability context, reorganising and facilitating the team, and then amalgamating the organising and service delivery activities through integrating formal meetings and informal interactions. Fourthly, the technologisation of practice involves the collaborative community assemblage and/or appropriation of further technologies into practice thereby strengthening the local and extended relationships of accountability and expanding the boundaries of practice. The research describes how the technologisation of practice is the enactment of a number of mutually enabling practice dualities, which together simultaneously discipline and realise expertise. The interrelated practice dualities are individual-community, subjective-objective, local-global, formal-informal and governmentality-communal self-governance. The situatedness of practice is shown to necessitate a subjectivity-objectivity duality, whereby individual and communal experience is drawn upon to see through the otherwise opaque nature of statistics and information. The alignment of practice with the broader organisation and professional colleagues realises a local-global duality, whereby the community's local understandings are informed and shaped by distant issues. The formal-informal duality is a mechanism by which practice is increasingly collaboratively conceptualised and enacted, and thereby standardised. Individual and communal 'expertise' becomes realised through the assemblage and appropriation of organising and transforming tools and artefacts, or alternatively technologies. At the same time, the community in defining the use of such technologies as competent practice is disciplining their own conduct. Through this action a governmentality-communal self-governance duality is realised as the nursing community pursues expertise while disciplining themselves; by engaging in collaborative interactions and using standardised technologies the community constructs and makes visible their knowing, practice and expertise.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">South Western Sydney Area Health Service (N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">Nursing -- Technological innovations</field><field name="subject">Pediatric nursing -- New South Wales -- Sydney</field><field name="subject">Change</field><field name="subject">Innovation</field><field name="subject">Ethnography</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Governance</field><field name="subject">Community of practice</field><field name="subject">Health</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soldering wrought wires to cast alloy partial dentures</field><field name="creator">Wheatley, David James</field><field name="description">Master of Dental Surgery</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Partial dentures</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mucosa of the hard palate under the denture base</field><field name="creator">Winspear, William James</field><field name="description">Master of Dental Surgery</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Palate</field><field name="subject">Prosthodontics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation Of Collagenase Production And Aspects Of Vascular Pathology In Advanced Periodontitis</field><field name="creator">Pinchback, Jane Sherwood</field><field name="description">Master of Science in Dentistry</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">periodontitis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5082</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systems of order: The satirical novels of
Evelyn Waugh</field><field name="creator">Milthorpe, Naomi Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Systems of Order: The satirical novels of Evelyn Waugh is a study of Evelyn Waugh&#146;s satire.  It offers a contextual reading of eleven works by Waugh, presenting revisionist readings of familiar novels and according attention to previously neglected works.  It aims to sketch out the main features of Waugh&#146;s satire, including Waugh&#146;s lexis and the use of certain key images and motifs.  Comparative analysis of Waugh&#146;s satirical novels with works by contemporary writers such as Clough Williams-Ellis, Wyndham Lewis, Stella Gibbons and T.S. Eliot brings into sharp relief the techniques and targets of Waugh&#146;s satire.
&#182;
This thesis argues that despite Waugh&#146;s tongue-in-cheek denial of satire&#146;s efficacy in a complacent modern world, he did indeed write satire of a peculiarly twentieth century kind.  Waugh&#146;s apparently anarchic novels reflect, behind the detached insouciance of their narrators, the moral standards which the novels ostensibly claim are absent in the modern world.  
&#182;
In Waugh&#146;s writing, satire is effected through the creation of systems of literary order.  The structure and patterning of his novels, and his masterful use of the rhetorical techniques of satire, mete out punishment on a formal level.  Waugh&#146;s satirical novels dramatize the tension between truth, order and civilization, and their oppositions, disorder and barbarism.  Systems of Order suggests that from the very first, Waugh&#146;s satiric project aimed toward the repudiation of modern disorder.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evelyn Waugh</field><field name="subject">satire</field><field name="subject">English literature 20th Century</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090630.150502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics of fluid flow and fluid chemistry during crustal shortening</field><field name="creator">Barker, Shaun</field><field name="description">In this thesis, an integrated structural and chemical approach has been used to investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of fluid chemistry, and fluid flow pathways, during crustal shortening. The Taemas Vein Swarm is hosted in a limestone-shale sequence, the Murrumbidgee Group, in the Eastern Belt of the Lachlan Orogen, in New South Wales, Australia. The Taemas Vein Swarm (TVS) is composed of calcite &#177; quartz veins, hosted in a series of faults and fractures, which extends over an area of approximately 20 km2. The Murrumbidgee Group is composed of several formations, comprising massive grey micritic limestones, redbed sandstones and shales,and thinly interbedded (10&#150;20 cm scale) limestones and shales.
&#182;
The sedimentary sequence has been folded into a series of upright, open to close
folds, and was probably deformed during either mid-late Devonian, or early Carboniferous, crustal shortening. To the east, the Murrumbidgee Group is overthrust
by a Silurian volcanic sedimentary sequence along the Deakin-Warroo Fault System.
Crosscutting and overprinting relationships demonstrate that vein growth was synchronous with folding, with different vein types related to different fold mechanisms
at various stages of fold growth. 
&#182;
Flexural slip folding led to the development of bedding-concordant veins (hereafter
called bedding-parallel veins). Flexural flow in semicompetent to incompetent beds
caused en echelon extension vein arrays to grow. Decoupling between beds, and
dilatancy at fold hinges led to significant vein growth. In addition, fold lock-up led to
limb-parallel stretching, and the growth of bedding-orthogonal extension fractures.
&#182;
Vein growth is inferred to have occurred in a compressional tectonic regime (i.e.
sigma3=vertical). Oxygen isotope quartz-calcite thermometry suggests that veins formed at temperatures of 100&#150;200 oC. The depth of vein formation may have been between
about 5 and 8 km. Vein textures indicate that growth of veins occurred during
multiple cycles of permeability enhancement and destruction. Subhorizontal extension
fractures, and faults at unfavourable angles for reactivation, imply that fluid
pressures exceeded lithostatic levels during the growth of some veins. Coexisting
extension and shear fractures imply that differential stress levels varied over time.
&#182;
Flexural slip continued throughout folding at Taemas, despite some fold limbs
being at angles extremely unfavourable for reactivation ( &gt; 60). As folds approached
frictional lock-up, flexural slip continued to occur when supralithostatic fluid pressures were developed. Therefore, large, bedding-discordant faults were not
developed to accommodate strain during folding, explaining a deficiency of larger
faults in the TVS.
&#182;
Infiltration of overpressured fluids occurred into the base of the Murrumbidgee
Group, and was channelled into a distributed mesh of small faults and fractures.
At the point that a connected &#145;backbone&#146; flow network developed in the TVS, highpressure
fluids would no longer be available to allow continuing flexural slip on fold
limbs approaching lockup. Thereafter, larger faults would develop, which would
adjust the fault population in the TVS to a more &#145;typical&#146; displacement-frequency
distribution. This had not occurred in the Taemas area by the time crustal shortening
ceased. An abundance of small faults, and fracturing driven by invasion of
overpressured fluid, implies that the TVS formed via an &#145;earthquake swarm&#146; process.
&#182;
Modern analytical techniques, utilising laser ablation sampling technology, allow
high-spatial resolution chemical data to be collected from syntectonic veins. Insights
into the role that fluid-mineral interface processes may have on the chemistry of minerals grown in syntectonic veins were provided by an experimental study. Moderate sized ( &lt; 1&#8722;5 mm) synthetic calcite crystals were successfully grown to investigate the uptake of rare earth elements (REE) into calcite. Changes in crystal morphology are linked to variable solution chemistry, which has important implications for the interpretation of hydrothermal vein textures. High-spatial resolution chemical analyses of synthetic calcite crystals demonstrate significant fluctuations in REE concentrations over distances of &lt; 200 &#956;m within calcite crystals. Time-equivalent regions on different crystal faces have significantly different REE concentrations,
indicating that fluctuations in calcite trace element composition cannot be interpreted
exclusively in terms of changing &#145;bulk fluid&#146; composition. Rare earth element
anomalies (Eu/Eu* and Ce/Ce*) are not significantly influenced by compositional
zoning, and may be robust indicators of changes in solution bulk chemistry and fluid
oxidation state. 
&#182;
Changes in isotopic ratios (13C, 18O and 87Sr/86Sr), and trace element concentrations in veins from the TVS are related to variations in fluid source, flow pathways and chemical conditions (e.g. trace element complexation, precipitation rate, fluid oxidation) during hydrothermal fluid flow. This integrated structural, textural and chemical approach has direct application to the examination of hydrothermal veins
in fracture-hosted ore deposits, and may allow the fluid source and/or chemical
conditions conducive to the formation of high-grade ore to be discerned.
&#182;

Vein 18O compositions systematically increase upwards through the Murrumbidgee
Group, caused by progressive reaction of an externally derived, low-18O fluid (of
probable meteoric origin) with host limestones. Vein 18O and 87Sr/86Sr compositions vary spatially and temporally within the same outcrop, and within individual veins, which is inferred to be caused by the ascent of packages of fluid along constantly changing flow pathways.

A theoretical and experimental  study  of  the vibrational and chemical relaxation rates  of  diatomic gases,  in  flows behind shock waves  and along nozzles,is made here.
&#182;
The validity of  the  conventional relaxation rate models, which  are generally used  to analyse experiments, is tested by developing a detailed microscopic description of  the diatomic relaxation processes.     Assuming  the diatomic molecules to be represented by  the anharmonic Morse Oscillator,  the vibrational Master equation,  which  describes  the  time variation  of  each vibrational energy  level population, is constructed by allowing one-quantum vibration to translation   (V-T) energy exchanges and vibration to vibration (V-V) energy exchanges between the molecules.  Dissociation and recombination are allowed to occur from, and to, the uppermost vibrational  level. Solving the Master equation, it is found
that a number of effects are explained by the inclusion of V-V  transitions. In particular it  is  found that  V-V energy exchanges  cause  the  induction  time for H2 dissociation  to be increased; suggest  that  the  linear rate law, for H2 and Ar  mixtures, fails for a H2 mole  fraction above 20%;  give an acceleration of vibrational excitation as equilibrium is approached  for H2 and N2; cause the vibrational temperature to be lower than the value found without V-V  transitions for vibrational de-excitation in nozzle flows of H2 and N2,  and conversely for recombination of H2 in nozzle flows.  The
most important  result is  the demonstration  that conventional nozzle flow  calculations, with shock-tube-determined dis-sociation and vibrational excitation rates, appear to be valid for the recombining and vibrationally de-excitating flows considered.
&#182;
The dissociation rates of undiluted nitrogen are measured in the free-piston shock  tube DDT, using time-resolved optical interferometry,  over a temperature range of  6000-14000K and confirm the strong  temperature dependence of the pre-exponential  factor  observed by Hanson and Baganoff (1972). 
&#182;
The vibrational de-excitation and excitation rates are determined in the small  free-piston shock tunnel T2  over temperature ranges of 2000-4000K and 7000-10300K, respectively, by measuring  the shock angles  and curvatures,  from optical interferograms,  of  flow over an inclined  flat plate in the nonequilibrium nozzle flow.  The de-excitation rate is  found to be within a factor of  ten of the excitation rate, while the excitation rate of N2 by  collision with   N  is  found to be
less  than about 50  times  the excitation rate  of  N2 by N2.
The dissociation rates  of nitrogen, in the flow behind a shock attached to a wedge, are investigated in the large free-piston shock  tunnel,  using  the shock curvature  technique.   The discrepancy, reported by Kewley and Hornung (1974b),  between theory and  experiment at the highest enthalpy is  found  to be resolved by including the measured helium contamination
(Crane 1975) in  the  free-stream. Reasonable agreement is obtained between experimental shock curvatures  and calculations using accepted dissociation rates.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hypersonic flow</field><field name="subject">high temperature gas dynamics</field><field name="subject">nitrogen dissociation</field><field name="subject">shock tunnel</field><field name="subject">nonequilibrium nozzle flows</field><field name="subject">vibrational relaxation of hydrogen and nitrogen</field><field name="subject">V-V and V-T energy exchanges</field><field name="subject">vibrational Master equation</field><field name="subject">shock waves</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090712.154732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parasites of native and exotic freshwater fishes in the south-west of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">marina@umt.edu.my</field><field name="description">Fewer than 200 fish species are found in freshwater habitats in Australia, of which 144 are confined exclusively to freshwater. At least 22 species of exotic freshwater fish have been introduced into Australia, and 19 of these have established self-sustaining populations. However, the parasite fauna of both native and exotic freshwater fishes in Australia is poorly known. This is particularly the case in the south-west of Western Australia, where there have been no previous comprehensive studies of the parasites of 14 native species and nine or more exotic species of fish found in freshwater habitats.

This study represents a survey of the parasites of freshwater fishes in the South West Coast Drainage Division and reports 44 putative species of parasites in 1429 individual fishes of 18 different species (12 native and six exotic) from 29 locations. Parasites were found in 327 (22.88%) fishes, and of the infected fishes, 200 (61.16%) were infected with only one species of parasite and 127 (38.84%) were infected with two or more species of parasites. For helminth and arthropod parasites, which were more comprehensively surveyed than protozoan and myxozoans, I found 37 species compared to 77 species found in a recent study of fishes from the East Coast Drainage Division.

The present study demonstrated that parasitic infection was significantly more common in native fish species (mean prevalence of infection with any species of parasite = 0.36 &#177; 0.09) than in exotic fish species (0.01 &#177; 0.12). Parasites were found in all native fish species, but in only two exotic fish species that were examined. Parasite regional and component community diversity were estimated by species richness (the number of species, S) and by an index of taxonomic diversity (HT). Both parasite species richness and parasite taxonomic diversity were significantly greater in native fish species (mean S = 10.5 &#177; 2.3; mean HT = 1.19 &#177; 0.14) than in exotic fish species (mean S = 1.6 &#177; 3.3; mean HT = 0.27 &#177; 0.20). These relationships were consistent over all geographic locations that were sampled. The reduced parasite load of exotic species compared to native species has been previous reported across a wide range of taxa. It is thought to arise partly because founding populations of hosts have a low probability of harbouring the species&#146; total parasite fauna, and partly because parasites that infect introduced exotic species may not be able to maintain their life cycle in the new environment. It has been suggested that a reduced parasite load increases the competitive ability of exotic species compared to native species (the parasite release hypothesis) and this may partly explain the abundance and apparent competitive success of exotic over native species of freshwater fish in the South West Coast Drainage Division.

For native species of fish, there were major differences among species in both prevalence of parasitic infection and parasite community diversity, but this variation was not related to fish size, whether the fish were primarily freshwater or primarily estuarine, or whether they were primarily demersal or pelagic.

In this study, I report two new parasites in south western Australian waters. Both are copepod parasites; Lernaea cyprinacea and a new species of Dermoergasilus. The Dermoergasilus appears to be native to the south-west of Western Australia and has been described as Dermoergasilus westernensis. It differs from previously described species in the genus principally by the armature of the legs. This new species was found on the gills of freshwater cobbler, Tandanus bostocki and western minnow, Galaxias occidentalis in two different river systems.

Lernaea cyprinacea is an introduced parasitic copepod found on the skin and gills of freshwater fishes in many areas of the world. The parasite has not previously been reported in Western Australia. We found infestations of L. cyprinacea on four native fish species (G. occidentalis; Edelia vittata; Bostockia porosa; T. bostocki) and three introduced fish species (Carassius auratus; Gambusia holbrooki; Phalloceros caudimaculatus) at two localities in the Canning River, in the south-west of Western Australia. The parasite has the potential to have serious pathogenic effects on native fish species, although it appears to be currently localised to a small section of the Canning River.

Over all localities from which fishes were sampled in the present study, the proportion of native freshwater fishes with parasitic infections and the component community diversity of the parasite fauna of native fishes were both negatively related to habitat disturbance, in particular to a suite of factors (river regulation, loss of riparian vegetation, eutrophication and presence of exotic fish species) that indicate increased human usage of the river and surrounding environment. The reduced parasite load and diversity in native fishes from south-west rivers with greater human usage was due principally to the loss of a number of species of trematode, cestode and nematode endoparasites which use fishes as intermediate hosts. Other studies have also found that endoparasites with complex life cycles are most likely to be adversely affected by environmental changes, presumably because any environmental changes which impact on either free-living parasite stages or on any of the hosts in the complex train of parasite transmission will reduce parasite population size and may cause local extinction of the parasite species.

The most heavily infected species of native freshwater fish in the South West Coast Drainage Division was T. bostocki with 96% of all individuals containing at least one species of parasite. As with most freshwater fishes of south-west Australia, T. bostocki is limited in its distribution to waterways with relatively low salinity. The degree of parasitism and histopathology of internal and external organs in T. bostocki from the Blackwood River was examined over a period of rapid, seasonal changes in water salinity. As salinity increased, the infracommunity richness and prevalence of ectoparasites on the skin of fishes decreased, while the infracommunity richness and prevalence of endoparasites increased. This was associated with a decrease in histopathological lesion scores in the skin and an increase in histopathological lesion scores in internal organs, particularly the intestine. I hypothesise that the seasonal spike in salinity had two contrasting effects on parasitic infections of T. bostocki. Firstly, it increased the mortality rate of parasites directly exposed to water, leading to a decrease in ectoparasitic infection and associated pathology. Secondly, it suppressed immune function in fish, leading to a decreased mortality rate of parasites not directly exposed to water and a more severe pathological response to endoparasitism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parasites</field><field name="subject">freshwater fish</field><field name="subject">salinity</field><field name="subject">histopathology</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090720.141418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Novel Diagnostic and Vaccine Options for Beak and Feather Disease Virus</field><field name="creator">tickle_me_patty@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">Beak and Feather Disease Virus (BFDV) is a circovirus which causes ill-thrift, feather loss and immunosuppression leading to secondary infections and eventually death in psittacine birds. The development of standardised reagents for the detection and characterisation of BFDV infections and for the production of protective vaccines has been difficult as no cell culture system has yet been found to grow the virus successfully in vitro. However, the development of consistent and effective diagnostic tests and vaccines is now more practical through the application of nucleic acid-based detection methods and recombinant technology.

A quantitative real-time PCR assay for the detection of BFDV DNA was developed, using primers designed to amplify a conserved 81 bp fragment of ORFV1 and SYTO9, a fluorescent intercalating dye, with assays run on a Corbett RotorGene 3000. A synthetic oligonucleotide was used to establish standard curves for the quantitation of viral load in both blood and feather preparations. The assay was very sensitive, with a detection limit of 50 copies/&#236;L. The assay was developed using BFDV-positive DNA extracts from the feathers of 10 different species of birds and validated with blood and feather samples from corellas vaccinated with an experimental BFDV vaccine, then challenged with live virus. Viral DNA was reliably detected in the blood of all control (non-vaccinated) birds and in some vaccinated birds. Contamination of the environment with the feather dander of BFDV-infected birds meant that HA feather preparations were unreliable for the detection and quantitation of viral excretion. Nonetheless, the assay should prove to be a useful and sensitive test for the detection of viral DNA in a range of samples in future investigations.

A recombinant BFDV capsid protein was also produced and a specific monoclonal antibody developed against it. The behaviour of the protein in haemagglutination (HA) assays and the behaviour of the monoclonal antibody in western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC), ELISA and haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assays were characterised. The protein had the ability to agglutinate galah erythrocytes as per the wild-type virus and this agglutination was successfully inhibited by antibodies to wild-type BFDV from naturally immune psittacine birds. Furthermore, the protein self-assembled into virus-like particles as determined by electron microscopy. The antibody was specific for both the recombinant BFDV capsid protein and the whole virus and had similar optimal titres when used in western blotting and IHC. The antibody also had HI activity and detected BFDV virus from 3 genera of psittacine birds, including the recently described cockatiel BFDV isolate. A novel &#147;blocking&#148; (or &#147;competitive&#148;) ELISA (bELISA) for the detection of anti- BFDV antibodies in psittacine sera (Ab-bELISA) was also developed and validated with 166 samples from eastern long-billed corellas vaccinated with the recombinant capsid protein and challenged with live virus. The bELISA was found to be both sensitive and specific and correlated strongly with the HI test, thus it should have wide application for the serodiagnosis of BFDV.

A survey of cockatiels (n=88) housed at commercial aviaries was conducted to investigate whether BFDV infection occurs in cockatiels. All birds were diagnosed as being virus-free by PCR and HA and had no detectable antibody titre by HI assay. In addition to this, the genomes of two BFDV isolates obtained from diseased cockatiel feathers were sequenced and cross-reactivity assays performed using virus eluted from these feathers and sera from naturally immune psittacine birds. Serological cross-reactivity results and phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences indicated that the cockatiel virus isolates were serologically and genetically different to other BFDV isolates. This is the first report of an antigenically distinct BFDV in psittacine birds. Since the Ab-bELISA has a lower limit of detection than the HI assay, it was used to repeat the cockatiel sero-survey. No antibodies were detectable in any of the cockatiels tested and thus questions about the real prevalence of BFDV infection in cockatiels and the possible existence of a novel BFDV serotype adapted to cockatiels remain unanswered.

The successful control of PBFD in both pet and wild birds depends on the development of vaccines that incite a strong specific immune response and can be efficiently produced in large quantities. Recombinant BFDV capsid proteins have recently been considered as candidate vaccines against BFDV and recombinant techniques allow the development of other candidate vaccines, including DNA vaccines. In order to examine the potential of DNA vaccination as a strategy for the prevention and control of BFDV, two DNA vaccines, based on the nucleotide sequence encoding the capsid protein of BFDV, were developed using the mammalian expression vector pVAX1. The vaccine constructs encoding both the full length and NLS-truncated capsid protein resulted in protein expression both in vitro and in vivo. Protein was detected in COS-7 cells transfected with the constructs with an indirect immunocytochemistry assay using the monoclonal antibody described in Chapter 5. Protein was present in the nucleus of cells transfected with the vaccine encoding the full-length nucleotide sequence and in the cytoplasm of cells transfected with the vaccine encoding the NLS-truncated sequence as expected. Both DNA vaccine constructs induced detectable levels of anti-BFDV antibodies in vaccinated birds, determined using the Ab-bELISA described in Chapter 5. Thus, DNA vaccines similar to those presented here may have application in the prevention and control of BFDV and some options for the further development of these vaccines into effective methods for the control of BFDV are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BFDV</field><field name="subject">circovirus</field><field name="subject">psittacine</field><field name="subject">ELISA</field><field name="subject">capsid</field><field name="subject">recombinant protein</field><field name="subject">vaccine</field><field name="subject">PCR</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090720.142800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The emotional rollercoaster of organisational change : affective responses to organisational change, their cognitive antecedents and behavioural consequences : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Smollan, Roy Kark</field><field name="description">Change is a potentially emotional event as people anticipate or experience its outcomes and processes. Managers and researchers often ignore the emotional aspects of organisational change, yet it is precisely these aspects that can promote acceptance of change or resistance to it. The focus of the research is on the many factors that contribute to cognitive, affective and behavioural responses to organisational change. A model of individual responses evolved from the literature review and helped guide the research questions. It indicates that responses to change depend on factors in four categories: those in the change itself (outcomes, scale, temporal issues and justice); those in the employee (their emotional intelligence, disposition, previous experience of change, and change and stress outside the workplace); those in the employee&#8217;s perceptions of the leaders/managers/agents (their leadership ability, emotional intelligence and trustworthiness); and those in the employee&#8217;s perception of the organisation (its culture and change context). Two main research approaches underpinned the thesis. Firstly, cognitive appraisal theory takes the position that emotion derives from cognition as people contemplate the importance of events (such as organisational change) to their wellbeing and consider how they will cope. Secondly, social constructionism was used as a theoretical platform because it combines the individual experience of emotions during change with the social forces that help shape them. Twenty-four interviews were conducted in Auckland, New Zealand. The participants were from a variety of industries, organisations, hierarchical levels, change roles, functional departments and ethnic, gender and age groups. They reported on many different types of change, small and large, with many focussing on some element of organisational restructuring. The study showed that people played different roles in change events - as leaders, managers, agents and recipients - and at times took on a combination of these roles, which did not always depend on hierarchy. The roles they played to some extent influenced their responses. Findings show that all 13 factors in the model produced some responses, but not in all participants. The most prevalent of these, and those that often provoke emotions of the greatest intensity, were personal outcomes and the fairness of change. Two additional factors surfaced, control over the change and support from colleagues and people outside the organisation, and the model was revised to include them. The study confirmed that organisational change is indeed an emotional event, and that these emotions arise from a host of factors that have individual, social and wider contextual origins.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">emotional intelligence</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">organisational culture</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ontological lockdown assessment : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Information Technology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Steele, Aaron</field><field name="description">In order to keep shared access computers secure and stable system administrators resort to locking down the computing environment in order to prevent intentional and unintentional damage by users. Skilled attackers are often able to break out of locked down computing environments and intentionally misuse shared access computers. This misuse has resulted in cases of mass identity theft and fraud, some of which have had an estimated cost ranging in millions. In order to determine if it is possible to break out of locked down computing environments an assessment method is required. Although a number of vulnerability assessment techniques exist, none of the existing techniques are sufficient for assessing locked down shared access computers. This is due to the existing techniques focusing on traditional, application specific, software vulnerabilities. Break out path vulnerabilities (which are exploited by attackers in order to break out of locked down environments) differ substantially from traditional vulnerabilities, and as a consequence are not easily discovered using existing techniques. Ontologies can be thought of as a modelling technique that can be used to capture expert knowledge about a domain of interest. The method for discovering break out paths in locked down computers can be considered expert knowledge in the domain of shared access computer security. This research proposes an ontology based assessment process for discovering break out path vulnerabilities in locked down shared access computers. The proposed approach is called the ontological lockdown assessment process. The ontological lockdown assessment process is implemented against a real world system and successfully identifies numerous break out path vulnerabilities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer security</field><field name="subject">computer vulnerability</field><field name="subject">break-out path vulnerabilities</field><field name="subject">shared access</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280500 Data Format::280505 Data security</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/946</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AC/DC : a study in art, gender and  popular culture : an exegesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master in Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Syme, Gemma</field><field name="description">This thesis began as an artistic investigation into the politics of identity and sex/sexuality. The main ideas that run throughout this exegesis position themselves within Nicolas Bourriaud&#8217;s ideas in the book Postproduction, and also around a parafeminist ideology. Within this I focus on popular music culture, the body, video and performance art, and visual representations of the body. I pay particular attention to the female body, and look into ideas of conventional social norms and how people challenge these. I look into the work of several female artists who deal with the visual representation, and also look at figures within popular music culture. Within band culture I look into how the band can be used as a vehicle to disseminate ideas wider audience. Art and music culture have fed off of each other for generations and can provide valuable strategies within each context for thinking beyond social norms. The remix can be used as a tactic to decode forms and narratives in popular culture. This can be used to investigate representations of identity within a space that is in a constant state of flux. This is particularly useful as a parafeminist strategy because it allows a context in which to question, rather than answer. As a result of this study I have found that there are no concrete answers when it comes to identity and sexuality, but can conclude that conventional gender representations and signifiers of identity can be remixed into different scenarios and narratives that can challenge social norms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">representations of the body</field><field name="subject">female artists</field><field name="subject">band culture</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">parafeminism</field><field name="subject">sexuality</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410199 Performing arts studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of imperfect mixing in suspended plant and animal cell cultures</field><field name="creator">Cheung, Caleb Kin Lok, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A common problem observed in large-scale cell cultivation is reduced culture performance compared with small-scale processes due to the existence of concentration gradients caused by poor mixing. Small-scale simulations using microbial cell suspensions have shown that circulation of cells through concentration gradients of oxygen, pH and glucose can result in reduction of cell growth and product formation similar to the effects observed in large-scale bioreactors. This study was aimed at using scale-down studies to investigate poor mixing in large-scale bioreactors used for suspended plant and animal cell culture. Two plant cell suspensions and a hybridoma cell line were used in this work. The range of oxygen transfer coefficients achieved in the hybridoma and plant suspensions were about 50???20 h-1 and 12???6 h-1, respectively. One-vessel simulation was developed to induce fluctuations of dissolved oxygen tension in a 2-L bioreactor using intermittent sparging of air and nitrogen. The effect of dissolved oxygen fluctuations on the cells was examined by comparing the performance of the cultures with those operated at constant dissolved oxygen tension. In the hybridoma suspension culture, only slight effects on cell growth were observed at circulation times above 300 s. No effect on the specific glucose uptake rate or antibody production was observed at the circulation times tested. Analysis of gene expression for selected hypoxia-related genes also suggested that the overall effect was limited. In plant cell suspensions, the specific growth rates and biomass yields on total sugar in the cultures under fluctuating dissolved oxygen tension were essentially the same as those at constant dissolved oxygen tension for both transgenic Nicotiana tabacum and Thalictrum minus. Under fluctuating dissolved oxygen tension, no effect on antibody accumulation was observed in transgenic N. tabacum suspensions, but a decrease in berberine accumulation was observed in T. minus. From the results, it can be concluded that only minimal effects due to the development of concentration gradients would be expected in large-scale bioreactors used for the cultivation of the hybridoma and plant cell suspensions tested in this work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal cell biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Plant cell biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Cell culture</field><field name="subject">Bioreactors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of recovery-recapture data for little penguins</field><field name="creator">Sidhu, Leesa A., Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses yearly mark-recapture-recovery information collected over a 36- year period, from 1968 to 2003, for 23 686 flipper-banded Little Penguins Eudyptula minor of Phillip Island, in south-eastern Australia. Such a long-term data set is extremely rare for any species. Few studies of any animal have been able to model age dependence for the survival, recapture and recovery probabilities simultaneously. I successfully apply such a modelling scheme and obtain biologically realistic age structures for the parameters. I also provide illustrations of erroneous results that may arise when analyses fail to consider simultaneous age dependence, or fail to detect annual variations that may mask age dependence. I obtain a low survival estimate of 17% in the first year of life, increasing to 71% in the second year, and around 80% thereafter, and declining gradually after age nine years. First-year survival increases with number of chicks fledged per pair, increases with annual average fledging weight and decreases with mean laying date. An increase in first-year survival is associated with warmer sea surface temperatures in the summer and autumn of the previous year, which agrees with biological considerations. Irrespective of this inter-year variation, birds born early in the breeding season, relative to the rest of their cohort, have greatly enhanced first-year survival, when compared to birds born late in that season. Fledglings survive better in years in which the mean fledgling weight is higher, and fledglings of above average weight have a better chance of survival than their underweight counterparts. I next analyse seven years of recapture data from a separate experiment studying the effect of banding on adult Little Penguins. In the year following marking, the i survival probability of banded birds is 6% lower than that of unbanded birds, while in subsequent years the survival is 4% lower for banded birds. Band loss is negligible. Finally, I compare the survival estimates for Phillip Island with those obtained for a six-year study in New Zealand. While first-year survival is significantly higher for New Zealand, there is a marked decline over time, coinciding with an increase in population size.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Little blue penguin</field><field name="subject">breeding</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Phillip Island</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">behavior</field><field name="subject">Eudyptula minor</field><field name="subject">survival</field><field name="subject">wildlife recovery</field><field name="subject">wildlife research</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38738</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Off-gas Nitrous Oxide monitoring for nitrification aeration control</field><field name="creator">Sivret, Eric Claude, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Effective control of nitrification processes employed at municipal wastewater treatment plants is essential for maintaining process reliability and minimizing environmental impacts and operating costs. While a range of process control strategies are available, they share a dependence on invasive liquid phase monitoring and are based on a periphery understanding of the metabolic status of the processes being controlled. Utilization of off-gas nitrous oxide (N2O) monitoring as a real-time indicator of the process metabolic status is a novel process control concept with the potential to address these concerns. This thesis details the development and evaluation of an off-gas N2O stress response based control technique. Examination of the stress response relationship demonstrated that it met the majority of the criteria of interest for process control. A simple feedback aeration control strategy was developed and evaluated through process simulation to determine the feasibility of implementation, cost effectiveness and associated environmental benefits. The off-gas N2O based control strategy provided better matching between aeration supply and metabolic demand, allowing the process to be maintained at the desired operating setpoints and avert nitrification failure. Performance was demonstrated to be similar to dissolved oxygen based feedback aeration control, although slightly more efficient at reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations. A technical, economic and environmental evaluation indicated that aeration control based on non-invasive off-gas N2O monitoring is technically feasible and has the potential to offer significant environmental and economic benefits including reductions in operating costs and process capital investment, as well as improved effluent compliance and reductions in emissions of gaseous pollutants including greenhouse gases. Overall, while off-gas N2O monitoring based aeration control techniques have the potential to provide significant economic and environmental benefits, a number of research questions remain to be answered. Future work in the form of long-term field trials is required to address these issues and allow quantification of economic and environmental benefits.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Off-gas.</field><field name="subject">Nitrification.</field><field name="subject">Aeration control.</field><field name="subject">N2O.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk, resilience and redemption: situating Hepatitis C in the lives of Indo-Chinese injecting drug users</field><field name="creator">Coupland, Heidi Kever, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Prevention and treatment of hepatitis C (HCV) among injecting drug users (IDUs) is a public health priority in many countries around the world. However, there has been limited research that explores cultural differences in IDUs?? approaches to HCV prevention and treatment. In Australia, previous research indicates that Indo-Chinese IDUs (Cambodian, Lao and Vietnamese) are an important group to target in HCV-related public health interventions.  This ethnographic study aimed to explore Indo-Chinese IDUs?? explanatory models of HCV and their influence on HCV-related prevention and treatment-seeking. Data were used to inform the development of a brief intervention (BI) about HCV treatment and its availability at a tertiary liver clinic. A trial of the BI was then conducted, to identify barriers to treatment uptake experienced by this group.   Participants?? explanatory models of HCV were syncretic and diverse within and between cultural groups. However, the study found that participants?? approaches to HCV prevention and treatment-seeking were predominantly influenced by a cultural context heavily shaped by the stigma associated with injecting drug use. In participants?? local worlds, social, structural and institutional forces exacerbated their marginalization and often positioned mainstream public health advice regarding HCV prevention and treatment as irrelevant or out of reach. Participants?? narratives of suffering, diminishing hope for the future and ??spoiled identity?? revealed how health promotion messages could act as a form of symbolic violence when they do not reflect the everyday constraints experienced by affected communities.  Hepatitis C was situated in participants?? lives relative to ??what mattered most?? (Kleinman, 2006), including the centrality of family obligations, upholding principles of loyalty and reciprocity within social networks and seeking redemption, through cultural maintenance, ??repaying?? parents and cessation of injecting drug use. Despite a plethora of barriers to becoming ??redeemed??, seeking redemption represented hope for the future and underscored many participants?? resilience and acceptance of suffering. Public health interventions targeting hepatitis C prevention and treatment uptake need to be situated in local, ??cultural?? realities, address key features of the risk environment and create hope rather than perpetuate social suffering among marginalised IDUs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42592</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supersonic liquid diesel fuel jets : generation, shock wave characteristics, auto-ignition feasibilities</field><field name="creator">Pianthong, Kulachate, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">It is well known that high-speed liquid jetting is one of the most powerful techniques available to cut or penetrate material. Recently, it has been conjectured that high-speed liquid jets may be beneficial in improving combustion in such applications as SCRAM jets and direct injection diesel engines. Although there are practical limitations on maximum jet velocity, a fundamental study of the characteristics of high-speed liquid fuel jets and their auto-ignition feasibility is necessary. Important benefits could be increased combustion efficiency and enhanced emission control from improved atomisation. The generation of high-speed liquid jets (water and diesel fuel) in the supersonic to hypersonic ranges by use of a vertical single stage powder gun is described. The effect of the projectile velocity and projectile mass on the jet velocity is found experimentally. Jet exit velocities from a range of different nozzle inner profiles and nozzle hardness are thoroughly examined. The characteristics and behaviour of the high-speed liquid jet and its leading bow shock wave have been studied with the aid of a shadowgraph technique. This provides a clearer picture of each stage of the generation of hypersonic liquid jets. It makes possible the study of hypersonic diesel fuel jet characteristics and their potential for auto-ignition. The fundamental processes by which a supersonic liquid jet is generated by projectile impact have been investigated. The momentum transfer from the projectile to the liquid and the shock wave reflection within the nozzle cavity are the key items of interest. A new one-dimensional analysis has been used in order to simplify this complex and difficult problem. The impact pressure obtained from the projectile was firstly derived. Then, an investigation of the intermittent pressure increase in a closed end cavity and a simple stepped, cross-sectional nozzle were carried out. The nozzle pressure and final jet velocity were estimated and compared to a previous method and to experimental results. Some interesting characteristics found in the experiments relate well to those anticipated by the analysis. The characteristics of a hypersonic diesel fuel jet and its leading edge shock wave were assessed for their potential for auto-ignition using fuel with cetane numbers from 50-100. The investigations were performed at normal ambient air and at elevated air (110 ???C) temperature. So far, there is no sign of auto-ignition that may occur because of the temperature rise of the induced shock.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jet cutting</field><field name="subject">Diesel motor</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical study of information systems security, understanding and awareness in E-government</field><field name="creator">Smith, Stephen J.C., School of Information Systems, Technology And Management, UNSW</field><field name="description">Recently e-Commerce systems have undergone an accelerated development, bringing a new set of risks and issues to government. As a result of this trend processes, policies and practices of organisations have changed dramatically. However, current research into the organisational risks and security in e- Government from an Australian viewpoint continues to be limited. This thesis is concerned with improving our understanding IS Security in e- Government. Key e-Government security issues are identified through a literature review. The results of a review of recent literature, together with investigatory interviews with experts from NSW Government, are used to further refine issues, research questions and propose a model of activity theory within a fuzzy logic framework. The developed model was refined and used to analyse results from the collected survey data, the results allow agencies to be classified by their progress towards accreditation to AS/NZS17799.1:2001. These results were able to be externally validated by another government agencies IS security survey. A series of surveys, forums, and interviews with government e-Commerce security officers were used to further test and refine the model, as well as answer the research questions posed. This study was conducted over a period of three years and identified the key issues in e-Government across a broad cross-section of NSW Government agencies. The results provide, a significant contribution to theory, especially for IS security managers through a more detailed understanding of the perceptions of practitioners. This research improves the level of understanding of IS security within the domain of e-Commerce risks and security within NSW Government by grouping agencies into meaningful categories, documenting successful practices by IS security managers, identifying drivers and inhibitors to IS security, determining the status of IS security across the NSW Government and monitoring the progress of agencies towards accreditation to AS/NZS177999:2001.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer security</field><field name="subject">Electronic government information</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23969</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between the viscosity of the mix and the tensile strength of cast gypsum</field><field name="creator">Selby, Alex</field><field name="description">Master of Dental Surgery</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gypsum</field><field name="subject">Dental materials</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4935</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Knowledge Based Supervisory Support System for Pan Stage Operations in a Sugar Mill</field><field name="creator">Dodd, Roland John</field><field name="description">The recent downturn in world sugar prices has placed even greater demands upon the Australian sugar industry to reduce the costs of sugar manufacture and increase the consistency of producing high quality sugar. One of the proposed approaches in increasing the consistency of very high quality sugar production and leveraging further avenues for cost saving is in the development of a computer based advisory system. This system is able to provide expert knowledge in the area of pan stage management and best practices in the absence of human experts. This thesis explores the design, key features and outcomes of a knowledge based supervisory support system (KBSSS) framework proposed specifically for providing cooperative decision support in the area of pan stage operations within a sugar mill. To demonstrate the viability of the proposed KBSSS framework a prototype system was developed in accordance with the proposed framework.      The KBSSS utilises three core innovative system technologies that form the core components of the proposed KBSSS framework. These technologies are: 1) Dynamic industrial pan stage process models for identifying the dynamic relationships between sections of pan stage operations to allow for future forecasting of pan stage operating conditions, 2) Integration techniques for the merging of the developed pan stage process models into the hybrid fuzzy logic expert system rule base to provide localisation adjustment to match with local real world factory operational conditions, and 3) Explanatory capabilities to provide justification and support of system advice and recommendations.       As a result of research and development carried out in this thesis, the KBSSS's test results demonstrated in the thesis indicate the viability of the proposed KBSSS framework and highlight the forecasting capabilities of the developed system resulting in favourable outcomes compared to data from pan stage operations. As a result of the research undertaken in the thesis a prototype KBSSS, for pan stage operations, based upon the three core supporting intelligent system technologies reported in the thesis has been developed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision support systems</field><field name="subject">knowledge based systems</field><field name="subject">sugar production</field><field name="subject">process control.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090721.111341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Larrikin Paradox: An Analysis of Larrikinism's Democratic Role in Australian Journalism.</field><field name="creator">Vine, Josie</field><field name="description">The Larrikin Paradox is concerned with the unexplored nexus between Australian journalism's larrikin tradition and Enlightenment-informed normative theories relating to journalism's public responsibility in liberal democracy.  Australian journalism's larrikin tradition, with its connotations of irresponsibility, has so far been considered an inappropriate lens through which to conceptualise Australian journalism's public role. Yet, paradoxically, it is the larrikin's capacity for irresponsibility that gives him, or her, the potential to be an enacting agent of Australian journalism's public responsibility.      Using a form of Cultural Historiography, The Larrikin Paradox tests this Thesis Statement:      In Australian history, larrikin journalists have been responsible for facilitating and protecting democratic freedom in the public sphere from authority. Because this freedom is in a state of vulnerability, contemporary Australian journalism still needs its larrikin tradition to vouchsafe a work culture capable of maintaining its declared responsibility to 'inform citizens' and 'animate democracy'.             However, the dearth of theory concerning the larrikin as a democratic figure has meant that The Larrikin Paradox has had to conceptualise it, more or less, from scratch. After first assembling the figure from over a century of references to the larrikin, The Larrikin Paradox approaches this conceptualisation using a process of historiographical recovery and interpretation.        Using a literature review of larrikinism in general, The Larrikin Paradox investigates a possible larrikin axiology relevant to Australian journalism micro-culture. This axiology is gleaned from an analysis of the term's meanings in sources such as dictionaries and commentaries on Australian English, as well as biographical and autobiographical material directly related to Australian journalism.       Once gleaned, this axiology is used to inform an investigation into the history of larrikinism in Australian journalism. The history is drawn from those salient sources of journalism as a micro-culture: biographies and autobiographies by, or about, Australian journalists. Here we assume that our axiological 'compass' can help us seek out the larrikin elements in those micro-cultural sources; thereby identifying manifestations of larrikinism within almost 150 years of Australian journalism history.      With larrikinism's historical and axiological significance established, The Larrikin Paradox moves on to a comparative analysis of Australian journalism during the Whitlam (1972 - 1975) and Howard (1996 - 2007) eras using oral history and industry-specific publications. This part of the investigation finds there is marked divergences in Australian journalism's cultural interpretation of its larrikin tradition arising from distinct socio-political contexts. In short, the Howard generation (1996 - 2007) of journalists is found to be less larrikin than those of the Whitlam generation (1972 - 1975).      However, with the cultural theories of Stuart Hall (1978) and Raymond Williams (1958, 1977) in mind, The Larrikin Paradox concludes that the larrikin, as a democratic figure, can be re-constructed within the micro-culture of Australian journalism.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian journalism history</field><field name="subject">Australian journalism culture</field><field name="subject">larrikinism</field><field name="subject">democracy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090721.140654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In Heaven, as it is on Earth: Representations of literary heavens in contemporary literature, with a focus on Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones</field><field name="creator">Tidy, Samantha Ellen</field><field name="description">This exegesis examines the landscape of heaven depicted in the contemporary novel, The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold.  I examine the various characteristics of the heaven (or 'afterlife') depicted in Sebold's novel, with the aim of ascertaining the narrative effects of using this device.        Using Ingrid Daemmrich's analysis of the paradisiacal motif in literature as a framework (Daemmrich, I 1997, Studies on Themes and Motifs in Literature: Enigmatic Bliss, The Paradise Motif in Literature, Peter Lang, New York), I reveal characteristics in The Lovely Bones that are both consistent with and challenge traditional literary representations of heaven and which therefore demonstrate that the text utilises the established literary motif of heaven for symbolism and meaning, but in a contemporary context.      I explore the growing trend of contemporary literary heavens by reviewing two other literary heavens that are relevant to this scholarship. I examine where as writers and readers, we ascertain our concept of heaven (in society's religious foundations and from prior literature), and for the relevance of the key text, I briefly discuss the author's likely cultural influences. Having established the novel's lack of alignment with a religious version of heaven, I then examine the nature of and the narrative effect of, the personalised heaven depicted in the novel, The Lovely Bones.      In doing so, I explore one of the new portraits of heaven in literature, an example which represents a growing trend away from portraying a classic edenic heaven shared by all humanity (and traditional to literary representations of heaven), toward a contemporary, personalised heaven that seeks to meet the wants and desires of the individual in our modern society. With reference to literature's ability to reflect back to us, our society's beliefs and values, I examine what this new portrait of heaven reveals about society.

Its purpose goes beyond providing a soft and dry surface to sit on. By putting down your picnic blanket you can temporarily stake your claim on that piece of land. We might consider the picnic blanket as a private haven in a public space. The cross-over between private and public space is a dynamic environment that is established by continually interacting and adapting. By collaborating with others in a space everyone can gain some ownership of that space. Using the picnic blanket as vehicle for investigation, I explore the boundaries of private and public space. Through linking the history of picnicking with the Sublime and particularly the Female Sublime, I establish its significance and the fact that it provides a gendered space. With the help of Marcuse&#8217;s ideas on the &#8216;natural state&#8217; I define the private sphere as a state of mind. I then look at that notion in relation to public space. The appropriation of public pace as described by De Certeau and the appropriation of mind space as described by Foucault set up a dynamic field by which private space is surrounded. The social navigation of our environment is the constant consideration of willingness to collaborate. It is something we are all part of, some readily, some trying to resist. Returning to Marcuse, I examine ways in which the private mind space can be preserved. It is the notion of innocence, a state of mind from before &#8216;the fall&#8217;, that Marcuse and others indicate as providing a barrier against surplus repression of societal judgement. The question is how to maintain this innocence. My personal investigation of innocence, which is presented in this exegesis through narrative, runs parallel to my practice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">picnic blanket</field><field name="subject">private space</field><field name="subject">Marcuse</field><field name="subject">female sublime</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410199 Performing arts studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Otahuhu B Power Station condenser in-leakage analysis and condensate monitoring system : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Electronics Engineering at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Heng</field><field name="description">Considerable ongoing risk of condenser in-leakage exists at Otahuhu B (OTB) Power Station. The condenser cooling water used at OTB station is corrosive brackish water with exceedingly high sodium and chloride concentrations. Significant signs of corrosion inside the condenser have been found recently. In the event of condenser in-leakage, the salt contaminants in the cooling water will directly enter the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) with the potential for significant and costly damage resulting in a long plant outage. A dynamic mathematical model was developed in the thesis to analyse the consequences of condenser in-leakage at OTB station. The analysis results show that the tolerance of the condenser to any leakage of cooling water is almost zero. Because the existing condensate monitoring system is not designed to detect contamination in this time frame, a new fast response system is required to detect condenser in-leakage immediately. A new dedicated fast response condensate monitoring system has been engineered and installed at OTB station as a part of the project scope. The new system dramatically reduces the response time to condenser in-leakage events. Critical instruments utilise multiple redundancy schemes to enhance the availability and reliability of the system. In addition, action level voting, timing, and alarming has been automated to assist operators in making correct decisions. The new condensate monitoring system is presently fully functional. The project has successfully achieved the objective of controlling the risk of condenser in-leakage events and minimising damage and negative effects on the plant.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corrosion</field><field name="subject">condensate monitoring system</field><field name="subject">cooling water</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering::290903 Other electronic engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/950</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sex, drugs and young people : novel research and health promotion approaches</field><field name="creator">Lim, Megan Su Cheng</field><field name="description">Young people are at risk of sexually transmitted infections (STI), and engage in sex and drug related risk behaviour. This thesis investigates novel methods to reach youth for research and health promotion. Mobile phone text messages (SMS) are convenient, low cost, fast, and popular among youth. SMS has been utilised in sexual health for clinical management, service delivery and health promotion, but few of these projects have been evaluated. Recognising this lack of research led to the design of a randomised controlled trial investigating the use of SMS and email in sexual health promotion. Recruitment of young people for this trial was piloted at Melbourne&#8217;s Big Day Out. 939 young people were recruited in several hours; 30% were classified as being at high risk of STI, and 46% had used illicit drugs in the month prior to the survey. Knowledge of STI was poor. Drug use was associated with both sexual risk behaviour and music preference. The study demonstrated that this festival is a valuable site for sex and drugs research and health promotion. The following year, young people were recruited at the music festival and randomised to an intervention group who received regular sexual health SMS and email, or a control group who received no messages. After 12 months, the intervention group had higher STI knowledge than the control group (OR 2.72, 95%CI 1.68, 4.41) and intervention group females were more likely to have had an STI test (OR 2.51, 95%CI 1.11, 5.69). Respondents&#8217; opinions of the messages were favourable. This simple, low-cost, and novel method was shown to be effective in improving young people&#8217;s sexual health. At-risk young people are not well represented in sex and drug behavioural surveillance in Australia. As the pilot study identified that a music festival was a suitable site for sex and drug research, the survey was repeated each year. Between 2005 and 2008, the proportion of young people at risk of STI decreased from 34% to 29%, and recent illicit drug use decreased from 46% to 43%. A limitation of the studies described herein is reliance on self-report, which is subject to recall bias; this can be reduced using diaries to collect behavioural data. Participants completed weekly diaries of sexual behaviour and a retrospective questionnaire. Correlation between the diaries and questionnaire was substantial, adding confidence to the validity of results of other studies in this thesis. Diaries can be collected in different ways; SMS has not previously been used for this purpose. Participants were randomised to complete diaries through SMS, online or paper. Online diaries were superior to SMS in completeness and participant preference, but SMS diaries were more likely to be submitted on time. This thesis has tested several novel options for researching and promoting health to young people. Through music festivals, SMS, and email, young people can be reached through settings and media they are familiar with. Use of these novel methods has increased understanding of risk behaviour among youth and been effective in sexual health promotion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sexual health</field><field name="subject">Sexually transmitted infections</field><field name="subject">Mobile phone</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Music festival</field><field name="subject">Illicit drugs</field><field name="subject">Young people</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/74616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motion-adaptive transforms for highly scalable video compression</field><field name="creator">Secker, Andrew J, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates motion-adaptive temporal transformations and motion parameter coding schemes, for highly scalable video compression. The first aspect of this work proposes a new framework for constructing temporal discrete wavelet transforms, based on motion-compensated lifting steps. The use of lifting preserves invertibility regardless of the selected motion model. By contrast, the invertibility requirement has restricted previous approaches to either block-based or global motion compensation. We show that the proposed framework effectively applies the temporal wavelet transform along the motion trajectories. Video sequences reconstructed at reduced frame-rates, from subsets of the compressed bitstream, demonstrate the visually pleasing properties expected from lowpass filtering along the motion trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of temporal wavelet kernels other than the simple Haar. We also demonstrate the benefits of complex motion modelling, by using a deformable triangular mesh. These advances are either incompatible or diffcult to achieve with previously proposed strategies for scalable video compression. A second aspect of this work involves new methods for the representation, compression and rate allocation of the motion information. We first describe a compact representation for the various motion mappings associated with the proposed lifting transform. This representation significantly reduces the number of distinct motion fields that must be transmitted to the decoder. We also incorporate a rate scalable scheme for coding the motion parameters. This is achieved by constructing a set of quality layers for the motion information,  in a manner similar to that used to construct the scalable sample representation. When the motion layers are truncated, the decoder receives a quantized version of the motion parameters used to code the sample data. A linear model is employed to quantify the effects of motion parameter quantization on the reconstructed video distortion. This allows the optimal trade-off between motion and subband sample bit-rates to be determined after the motion and sample data has been compressed. Two schemes are proposed to determine the optimal trade-off between motion and sample bit-rates. The first scheme employs a simple but effective brute force search approach. A second scheme explicitly utilizes the linear model, and yields comparable performance to the brute force scheme, with significantly less computational cost. The high performance of the second scheme also serves to reinforce the validity of the linear model itself. In comparison to existing scalable coding schemes, the proposed video coder achieves significantly higher compression performance, and motion scalability facilitates effcient compression even at low bit-rates. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is also competitive with state-of-the-art non-scalable video coders.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Video compression</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fracture analysis of glass microsphere filled epoxy resin syntactic foam</field><field name="creator">Young, Peter, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hollow glass microspheres have been used extensively in the automotive and marine industries as an additive for reducing weight and saving material costs. They are also added to paints and other materials for their reflective properties. They have shown promise for weight critical applications, but have thus far resulted in materials with low fracture toughness and impact resistance when combined with thermosetting resins in syntactic foam. The advent of commercially available microspheres with a wide range of crushing strengths, densities and adhesive properties has given new impetus to research into syntactic foam with better fracture behaviour. Current research suggests that the beneficial effects on fracture and impact resistance gained by the addition of solid reinforcements such as rubber and ceramic particles are not seen with the addition of hollow glass microspheres. The research presented in this paper has examined the mechanisms for fracture resistance in glass microsphere filled epoxy (GMFE) syntactic foams, as well as determined the effect microsphere crushing strength and adhesion strength has on the material???s fracture toughness. The flexural properties of various GMFE have also been determined. GMFE were manufactured with varying microsphere volume fraction up to 50%, and with variances in microsphere crushing strength and adhesion. The specimens were tested for Mode I fracture toughness in a three point single edge notched bending setup as described in ASTM D5045 as well as a three point flexural setup as described in ASTM D790-3. Fracture surfaces were inspected using scanning electron microscope imaging to identify the fracture mechanisms in the presence of microspheres. Results indicate a positive effect on fracture toughness resulting from new fracture areas created as tails in the wake of the microspheres in the fracture plane. Results also indicate a negative effect on fracture toughness resulting from weak microspheres or from interfacial disbonding at the fracture plane. These two effects combine to show an increase in GMFE fracture toughness as the volume fraction of microspheres is increased to between 10 ??? 20% volume fraction (where the positive effect dominates), with a reduction in fracture toughness as microspheres are added further (where the negative effect dominates).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fracture resistance</field><field name="subject">glass microspheres</field><field name="subject">syntactic foams</field><field name="subject">fracture toughness</field><field name="subject">flexural properties</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38657</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal conduction in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam model</field><field name="creator">Tempatarachoke, Pisut, Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">We conduct a comprehensive and systematic study of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) model using both equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, with the aim being to explain the cause of the anomalous energy-transport behaviour in the model.  In the equilibrium scenario, our motivation stems from the lack of a complete understanding of the effects of initial conditions on the energy dissipation among Fourier modes. We also critically reconsider the ????probes' that had been widely used to quantitatively describe the types of energy sharing in a system, and then decide on a preferred choice to be used in our equilibrium study. We establish, from strong numerical evidence, that there exists a critical energy density of approximately 0:1, above which the energy dissipation among the modes becomes independent of initial conditions and system parameters, and that the full equipartition of mode energy is never attained in the FPU model. We report, for the first time, the violation of particle positions in the FPU model at high energies, where the particles are found to pass through one another.  In the non-equilibrium scenario, we critically review the Nos???Se-Hoover algorithm thermostatting method largely used by other works, and identify its weaknesses. We also review some other alternative methods and decide on the most appropriate one to be implemented throughout our work. We confirm the divergence of the thermal conductivity of the FPU model as the chain length increases, and that kfpu [symbol] No.41, in agreement with other works. Our study further shows that there exists an upper limit of the anharmonicity in the FPU model, and that any attempt to increase the strength of this anharmonicity will not succeed. We also introduce elastic collisions into the original FPU model and find that the Modified  model (FPUC) still exhibits anomalous thermal conductivity. We conclude that a one-dimensional FPU-type model with ????only' nearest-neighbour interaction, regardless of being soft or hard, does not exhibit a finite thermal conductivity as the system size increases, due to the non-chaotic nature of its microscopic dynamics, the origin of which we are unable to account for.

Furthermore, when the hidden narrative is revealed, the surface narrative and its discursive codes become transformed. Post-colonial critics have argued that one aspect of post-colonial literature is the use of allegory in a way that the hidden narrative interpolates the surface narrative. This process of allegorical interpolation is one of the ways post-colonial literature is able to transform colonial discourses.  Through an analysis of the four novels, I argue that allegory is a significant aspect of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian writing in its depiction of the natural environment and the settler nation. Bringing together ecological theory with post-colonial theories of allegory, I coin the term 'ecological allegory' to describe a specific type of allegory in which nature as subject becomes revealed within the 'hidden' narrative of the text. Through this process of interpolation, the literary representation of the land is being transformed as the natural environment is depicted as a dialogical subject.  In the explication of the four novels as ecological allegories, I provide new readings of two canonical Australian texts, Remembering Babylon and Tourmaline, as well as, readings of two lesser known Indigenous Australian texts, Earth and Steam Pigs. I argue that theories of ecology provide a means for understanding the texts' representation of nature as subject. The allegorical mode of the novels offers a literary form whereby the natural environment as subject may be able to be represented in discursive language. Furthermore, in these allegories, the polysemy in the written mode of Australian literature is able to express the oral Indigenous worldview of Country, the land as a living entity. The claim that these texts are constructed as allegories, rather than simply reading the texts allegorically (known as allegoresis), combined with the methodology of ecological theory, to create a new term - ecological allegory - is an original way of reading Australian literature. Furthermore, my term 'ecological allegory' is an innovation in literary theory and its understanding of literary representations of the natural environment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Literature</field><field name="subject">Allegory</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic analysis of assisted reproductive technologies</field><field name="creator">Chambers, Georgina Mary, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are widely accepted as clinically effective in the treatment of infertility. However, there is a scarcity of economic information to influence decision making. Four studies were undertaken to inform public health policy and clinical practice in relation to equitable and effective resource allocation of ART. Study One used a detailed cost-analysis and decision-analytic model of Australian ART registry data to calculate age-specific costs per live-birth (all maternal ages; AUD 32,903). Study Two expanded the methodology to analyse economic aspects of ART in selected developed countries. Treatment costs reflected the costliness of the underlying healthcare system, with cycle costs highest in the US (USD 12,513) and lowest in Japan (USD 3956). ART was expensive from a patient, but not from a societal perspective. Demand was price elastic in the midrange of consumer prices (USD 3000-6000). Only countries with funding arrangements which minimised out-of-pocket expenses met expected demand. The main complication of ART is the high incidence of iatrogenic multiple births. Additionally, ART singletons have poorer perinatal outcomes than non??ART singletons. Study Three quantified the inpatient costs of ART versus non??ART deliveries in Australia. The poorer perinatal outcomes of ART singletons translated into 31% higher birth??admission costs for ART compared to non??ART singletons. The combined maternal and infant birth??admission costs of ART twins and triplets were 3 and 11 times higher than for singletons. Study Four was undertaken as a clinical and cost??effectiveness analysis of IVF versus stimulated intrauterine insemination (IUI). One IVF treatment was more effective than two cycles of IUI; cumulative live??birth rates (39% and 28%, respectively) and mean time to pregnancy (69 days and 44 days, respectively). IVF was more costly but more effective than IUI, with an incremental-cost-effectiveness-ratio of an additional live-birth well within society??s willingness-to-pay. This thesis provides the first detailed economic analysis of ART in Australia, and the most comprehensive economic review of ART among developed countries. The methodologies developed were used to cost the main complications of ART, and to indicate that IVF is more effective than IUI as a first-line therapy for subfertility.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preventing ethnic violence in Indonesia : civil society engagement in Yogyakarta during the economic crisis of 1998</field><field name="creator">Park, Jae Bong, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the engagement of civil society in Yogyakarta to prevent ethnic violence during the economic crisis of 1998. The thesis explains why and how the people of Yogyakarta avoided ethnic violence, particularly anti-ethnic Chinese riots, during the heightened socio-economic crisis of 1998. The thesis investigates interactions between civil society actors, local traditional leaders and grassroots people in Yogyakarta in preventing ethnic violence. I argue that various actions of civil society organisations in Yogyakarta were instrumental in preventing ethnic violence during the economic crisis of 1998. This argument runs counter to the popular Yogyanese myth that Sultan Hamengku Buwono X (HB X) played a dominant role in preventing ethnic violence during the economic crisis of 1998. The thesis will highlight some local mechanisms that have greatly contributed to the prevention of ethnic and religious violence in Yogyakarta. The findings are as follows:  (1) Civil society in Yogyakarta including Non-government organisations, interfaith dialogue organisations, intellectuals, student organisations, religious leaders, and business associations played a key role in managing the socio-economic crisis through the provision of staple food packages, arranging coordination meetings, and organising vigilante teams. In contrast, unlike the popular myth, Sultan HB X's role was limited.  (2) Local inter-ethnic civil society organisations such as Paguyuban Mitra Masyarakat Yogyakarta (Association of the Fellowship of Yogyakarta Society), Komite Kemanusiaan Yogyakarta (Yogyakarta Humanitarian Committee) and Tim Relawan Yogyakarta (Yogyakarta Volunteer Team) functioned as platforms of communication and coordination between Chinese and indigenous Indonesians, and Muslims and Christians. With the help of these inter-ethnic civil society organisations, the Chinese community and their business associations in Yogyakarta actively engaged in dispensing staple food packages.  (3) Local Islam-affiliated organisations in Yogyakarta such as the LKiS, MUI, NU, Muhammadiyah, and the PPP also played a significant role in managing heightened tensions. They cooperated with other non-Islamic civil society organisations in encouraging ethnic and religious pluralism and restraining primordial sentiment during the economic crisis of 1998.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Financial crisis</field><field name="subject">Yogyakarta (Indonesia)</field><field name="subject">Civil society</field><field name="subject">Ethnic violence</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&amp;quotHeavens and earth in one frame&amp;quot Cosmography and the form of the earth in the scientific revolution.</field><field name="creator">Biro, Jackie, School of History &amp; Philosophy of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the role of geography in the Scientific Revolution, a matter yet to be settled by historians of science. Specifically it argues that cosmography, the parent discipline of both astronomy and geography, was central to Copernican natural philosophy in the early modern period. Copernicus, Bruno, Gilbert, Galileo and Descartes all sought to provide a unified picture of the heavens and earth by harmonising ideas in geography and astronomy, according to established principles of cosmography. In addition, using concepts about the earth?s form to build heliocentric cosmological theories was routine amongst Copernican thinkers. Indeed, this analysis demonstrates that Copernicus, Bruno and Gilbert staked their claims about the heavens on their theories of the earth. Recognising cosmography offers several advantages to historical understanding of the Scientific Revolution. It helps explain the form of Bruno?s argument for an infinite cosmos and a multiplicity of worlds. It provides insights into Gilbert?s interest in the detailed structure of the earth, beyond simply magnetism, and reveals that his argument followed a more traditional path than generally thought. A cosmographic perspective explains why Galileo took such pride in his theory of the tides and clarifies the place of this theory in his case for heliocentrism. From the cosmographic viewpoint, Descartes appears as a radically ambitious cosmographer with his use of a single account of the creation of the heavens and earth, thereby linking geography and astronomy in a single physical theory. Thus, cosmography represented a competitive enterprise among the Copernican natural philosophers. In general, thinking in terms of cosmography helps us understand the manner in which geographical ideas entered into the conceptual developments of the Scientific Revolution. The main contribution to knowledge in this thesis is its identification of cosmography as a key frame of reference for early modern thinking about cosmology, overlooked in the historical literature.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cosmography</field><field name="subject">Science -- History</field><field name="subject">Astronomy</field><field name="subject">Physical geography</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Image of Agriculture Education in Botswana</field><field name="creator">mrammola@bca.bw</field><field name="description">This study examines agricultural education in Botswana among students and teachers. Since independence in 1966 to the present time, agricultural production has declined from about 40 percent to about 3 percent. Harsh climatic conditions and a general ignorance about agriculture contribute to the restricted perception of agriculture and careers in this field. Individual and focus group interviews were conducted with agricultural teachers who had resigned and former graduates in four secondary schools and three postsecondary educational institutions (Botswana College of Agriculture, University of Botswana, and Tonota College of Education). Negative, positive and mixed images emerged that revealed some similar and some contradictory perceptions of agriculture education. The attrition of teachers also attracted attention because of their working conditions and their images of agricultural teaching. However, the phenomenon of teacher attrition is not unique to agriculture.

Students and teachers had conflicting images concerning curriculum instruction. Teachers identified the inadequacy of practicals because students are unable to apply the theoretical knowledge they have acquired to satisfy the various skills required in their new jobs. On the other hand, students perceived practicals as misdirected intensive labour. Non-agricultural tertiary students demonstrated that they do not have a full understanding of the potential career opportunities that agriculture can provide. They often thought that agriculture was confined to ploughing and food production. Nevertheless, both agricultural students and non-agricultural students agreed that agriculture could be a good career that they might consider later in their lives.

Participants in the study suggested strategies to enhance the poor perception of agriculture education in educational institutions in Botswana. One strategy was for curriculum reform, such that agriculture teaching should reinforce practicals that are relevant to students&#146; needs. Practical instruction should not be used as intensive manual labour but should be used to target specific skills that are needed in industry. Agriculture teaching should start at primary school so that pupils can develop a positive image towards agriculture education at a young age, at the age of seven students could be involved in simple experiments conducted in laboratories, then at eleven years students can start practicals in the garden, making sure not to overwork the pupils.

Through career guidance and counselling, agricultural teachers should broaden the limited perception that agriculture is simply food production and expand the field to its scientific and commercial careers, such as food processing and marketing. Even though the Ministry of Agriculture provides some incentives to farmers, they misappropriate the schemes. Access to loans has to be provided for students who have completed their studies and cannot find jobs so that they can also join the field of production.

Even though women are dominated by men in both agriculture and in education and food production in Botswana, this trend is changing; there are more female enrolments in agricultural educational institutions than males. The government is trying to create an equitable distribution of resources for women as well. The position of women in Botswana is better than what literature has revealed in sub Saharan Africa.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agricultural image</field><field name="subject">Botswana</field><field name="subject">agricultural education</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090722.110138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The antimicrobial mechanism of action of 3,4-methylenedioxy-&#946;-nitropropene.</field><field name="creator">White, Kylie Suzanne</field><field name="description">This research investigated the mechanism of action in bacteria of 3,4-methylenedioxy-&#946;-nitropropene (BDM-I), a very broad spectrum antimicrobial lead compound in development as an anti-infective drug.  The thesis proposes that BDM-I inhibits bacterial protein tyrosine phosphatases, a novel mechanism of action for an antimicrobial agent and a new target in microorganisms.   This very open investigation was directed by considerable biological information on the effects of BDM-I in microorganisms and animals which provided insights into possible and improbable cellular targets.  The biological effects of BDM-I were investigated using biochemical and cell-based assays, transmission electron microscopy and whole genome DNA microarray analysis.  The specific experiments and order of execution were largely dependent on information gained as the project progressed.   BDM-I was shown not to target the metabolic pathways of the major classes of antibacterial drugs, which supports a novel mechanism of action.  Investigation of several species-specific effects suggested that cell signalling pathways were a possible target.  Based on the structure of BDM-I and review of the scientific literature on cell signalling in bacteria, the hypothesis that BDM-I acted by inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) was supported by demonstrating inhibition of human and bacterial PTP's in an enzyme assay.  This mechanism was consistent with other demonstrated effects: inhibition of the intracellular pathogen, Chlamydia trachomatis; inhibition of swarming in Proteus spp. and inhibition of pigment production in Serratia marcescens; and with kill kinetics in bacteria and yeast.   A pilot global genome analysis of BDM-I treated Bacillus subtilis did not detect differential expression of PTP genes but has provided many avenues for further investigation.   This research further supports the development of BDM-I as a broad spectrum anti-infective drug.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antimicrobial activity</field><field name="subject">nitropropenyl arenes</field><field name="subject">tyrosine phosphatase inhibition</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090723.101430</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconsidering Spaces Left-Over After Planning</field><field name="creator">Kinoshita, Yohei</field><field name="description">Suburbs in Melbourne present to us a unique context with which a new approach towards urban form can be devised using the existing conditions and opportunities found with infrastructural developments.

The concept of Athenic mentoring is offered and framed, in Jungian (Jung 1958;1996;2002) terms as an archetypical encounter between two people that can facilitate a significant transformative shift (metanoia) in the development of the personal and professional self. These shifts are initially at the level of 'being' but influence the more visible dimensions of 'doing' and 'knowing'. 'Doing' and 'knowing' can be articulated in terms of practice knowledge and skills (Sch&#246;n 1987a). 'Being' is framed in both Jungian (Jung 1958;1996;2002) and Rogerian (Rogers 1973;1996) terms as engagement of the authentic, grounded and integrated self, in ways that may be largely and initially unconscious, but that can be taken up in conscious awareness and are ultimately reflected in overt, observable behaviours.   Cunningham's (1988) framework of holistic interactive research was chosen as a method that allowed the researcher to draw on, as well as to reflect upon, his own experience in order to generate data. Written narrative and oral story-telling (Reason &amp; Hawkins 1988) have been fundamental to the creation and analysis of data. Indeed, the process of writing has been an important source of self-understanding, revelation and integration for the author. The power of archetypal story-telling - most obvious in the ancient stories of human challenge, development and triumph, such as that of Athena(Mentor), in the Greek tradition - is acknowledged and explored from this perspective. In this respect the researcher has followed Megginson's (2000) advice that research into mentoring deserves and demands 'vivid stories'.   The research approach also reflects Strauss and Corbin's (1990) suggestion that by staying close to the data ('grounding' theory in the data) before a deep immersion in the literature, the researcher will be more open to the insights that the data might reveal.   The starting point for the research was the researcher's observation that, in the context of being a 'hired mentor' in an organisational setting, 'turning points' occurred that could be characterised as significant, transformational shifts in the energy and perspective of the person being mentored. While these shifts were reflected in important changes in work, choices and outward behaviour and practice, it was not obvious when or how the shifts had occurred. The initial research questions were framed as: what does the mentor do that leads to this turning point? and, can this be identified so that mentors can improve their chance of achieving it in practice?   Later, the research journey itself led to a broader and richer framing of the research questions as a deeper exploration of the level at which transformative development of the self plays out and the implications of that for mentoring itself. The initial research question eventually was reframed as: How does the mentor need to be?    Major sources of data were stories of ten people who have been in mentoring relationships (either as mentor, mentee, or both). The researcher's own experience was also a significant source of the data.   In its presentation, the thesis attempts to 'track' and make transparent the ways in which listening to and writing down the stories of others, the researcher's own stories, engaging with the literature and writing reflective notes iterated with the construction of this particular conceptualisation of mentoring in 'Athenic' terms.    Both contemporary Western literature (the majority of it American) and translations of Homer's (1980; 1998) accounts of Athena as mentor were used initially to explore the nature of mentoring. Later, the Jungian (Jung 1958;1992;1996;2002) and post-Jungian (Hillman 1975;1996) literature on the notion of the archetypes; Buber's (1996) conception of relationship as 'I-Thou'; and Rogers' (1996) evocation of 'becoming a person' all helped to describe more richly the dynamics of Athenic mentoring - both in terms of the nature of transformative personal change and the dynamics of the relationship that facilitates it.   A major outcome of this research is the differentiation of Athenic mentoring (which facilitates the transformation of a person's 'being') from mentoring that helps to develop what a person 'knows' or 'does'. This differentiation will hopefully contribute to our understanding of the mentoring process, but at the most pragmatic level, will make it easier to navigate the complex and poorly 'mapped' contemporary literature.   It is concluded that Athenic mentoring might not be, fully or even partly, recognised until well after it occurs, and that because it involves the pyschodynamic and largely unconscious interplay of one person's dominant archetypes with those of another, it is not something that can be easily orchestrated or arranged. This challenges contemporary notions (Burke &amp; McKeen 1989; Murray &amp; Owen 1991; Cunningham 1993; Hay 1995) that mentoring can be packaged, 'commodified' and paid for in a similar way to coaching and counselling.   As a stimulus for further work, it is suggested that the role of mentor can be understood as completing or starting aspects of the development of self that have not been initiated or concluded in the parenting relationship; and the possibility for being a mentor or a mentee continues throughout life, or for at least as long as there remains the possibility that a 'Dream' (Levinson, Darrow, Klein, Levinson &amp; McKee 1978; Levinson &amp; Levinson 1996) can be fulfilled.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mentor</field><field name="subject">mentoring</field><field name="subject">coaching</field><field name="subject">Athena</field><field name="subject">doing</field><field name="subject">knowing</field><field name="subject">being</field><field name="subject">dream</field><field name="subject">archetype</field><field name="subject">leadership development</field><field name="subject">Athenic mentoring</field><field name="subject">development of self</field><field name="subject">stories</field><field name="subject">archetypical story-telling</field><field name="subject">Telemachus</field><field name="subject">holistic interactive research</field><field name="subject">dream</field><field name="subject">flow</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090723.115457</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of fluid-dynamic cavity oscillations and the effects of flow angle in an automotive context using an open-jet wind tunnel.</field><field name="creator">Milbank, Juliette</field><field name="description">Aeroacoustic whistles are a significant source of customer complaints to automotive manufacturers. Whistles can occur on many such components, but the relative position and configuration of rearview mirrors means they are a more problematic source of tonal noise on vehicles. The low subsonic complex turbulent flow, combined with small cavity scales, determines the possible whistle mechanisms. The one considered to be most problematic, fluid-dynamic cavity resonance, is the topic of this research thesis. The research scope is limited to the automotive environment of external rearview mirrors and the fluid-dynamic resonance mechanism: low subsonic Mach number, M = 0.05 - 0.13; laminar boundary layers; and two-dimensional, acoustically compact cavities. The low unit-cost of rearview mirrors and the desire to have simple identification and prediction schemes, that could be used by production engineers, determined an empirical approach.      A search of the existing literature revealed that there were some data on cavities of the above scale in low Mach number flow, but quoted errors in empirical descriptions were large and there was very little research on the effects of flow yaw angle on the chosen resonance mechanism. The research therefore aims to determine whether existing empirical descriptions of fluid-dynamic cavity resonance are suitable for the prediction of the resonance characteristics, with sufficient accuracy to enable unambiguous identification of the presence of the resonance and its mechanism. A second aim is to investigate the effects of a feature of the automotive flow environment, flow yaw angle, on the resonance. Flow yaw angle is determined by those components of the flow in the same plane as the surface in which the cavity is situated.      An experimental program was undertaken using a purpose-built aeroacoustic wind tunnel and a simple cavity model. Testing with two types of cavity configurations, as well as flow visualisation, investigated the main features of the resonance in time-averaged yawed flow. Within the scope of this thesis, it is shown that fluid-dynamic cavity resonance characteristics can be accurately identified by a simple empirical model, even in yawed flow. Various descriptors allow identification of the resonance threshold, stage, frequency and relative amplitude in non-yawed flow, while the frequency and stage can also be identified in yawed flow. The relative decrease in resonance amplitude in yawed flow, although identified for these experiments, would depend on the degree of spanwise variation in the boundary layer characteristics for a given cavity configuration. The results also identify significant issues with testing in a free jet tunnel, due to the nature of fluid-dynamic cavity resonance and the fluctuation energy  content in free shear layers. Despite this, the thesis aims are achieved, and appropriate design guidelines are produced for automotive designers.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cavities</field><field name="subject">fluid-dynamic oscillations</field><field name="subject">self-sustained oscillations</field><field name="subject">shear tones</field><field name="subject">flow yaw angle</field><field name="subject">automotive</field><field name="subject">open-jet wind tunnel</field><field name="subject">free shear layer interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090723.121800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performing postmemories: recollection in crisis</field><field name="creator">Trezise, Bryoni, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the problematic status and functioning of memory in a variety of contemporary contexts such as judicial cases, popular culture, television, memorials and museums. In doing this it develops an account of the culture of postmemory, originally defined by Marianne Hirsch as the experience of descendents of survivors of trauma, particularly second generation Holocaust survivors, who inherit that trauma from their family forbears. From Hirsch, postmemory can be understood as the possibility of remembering an event that one has not actually experienced. This thesis extends Hirsch???s notion of postmemory to account for a wider range of contemporary memory practices. These occur beyond family relationships to manifest in institutional and discursive sites such as the archive, the museum, the narrative and the tourist attraction. This thesis argues that it is in these sites that memory can be seen to be breaking away from its referential function. Instead of recollection, memory becomes the performance of slippage and the undoing of reference in which the fictive and the historical merge. The thesis plays out the ensuing crisis in recollection in scenes and actions of a theatre of the postmemorial ??? one characterised less by the familiar linear narratives of memory as by multiple and contradictory narratives formed through the operations of chance, reflexivity and ambivalence working within the contemporary cultural sphere.

The implicit assumption is that the inclusion of such illustrations will assist students in learning to read. Cognitive load theory suggests that this way of formatting learning materials may not be maximally effective as the inclusion of illustrations with written text constitutes redundant information that may interfere with learning. If working memory resources are devoted to the illustrations rather than the text, as is likely with young children, those resources will be unavailable to decipher the text. The elimination of redundant illustrations may thus enhance learning to read. Three experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of including illustrations in beginning reading materials. Experiment 1 compared reading materials consisting solely of simple prose passages with materials consisting of the same passages plus informative illustrations depicting the content of each passage. Reading proficiency improved more under the no illustrations condition. Experiment 2 compared the informative illustrations with uninformative illustrations. Reading proficiency improved more using uninformative illustrations. Experiment 3 compared uninformative illustrations with no illustrations and found no significant differences between these conditions. These results were interpreted within a cognitive load theory framework. It was concluded that informative illustrations are redundant and so impose an extraneous working memory load that interferes with learning to read.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognitive load theory.</field><field name="subject">Reading instruction.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contaminant degradation using nanosized zero valent iron particles</field><field name="creator">Sun, Quan, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Zero-valent iron (ZVI) has been successfully used for the degradation of a wide range of organic contaminants in groundwaters in recent years. The rate of degradation of contaminants by ZVI may be enhanced by use of nanoscale zero valent iron (nZVI) particles which possess higher surface area than the more widely used granular materials. However, the most widely used method of producing nZVI involves the reduction of FeIII by sodium borohydride is expensive. Dithionite can be used to reduce Fe(II) and produce cost effective nZVI under conditions of high pH and in the absence of oxygen. The efficiency of trichloroethylene (TCE) degradation using dithionite nZVI particles (nZVIS2O4) is similar to that of the conventional borohydride particles (nZVIBH4). Oxidation of benzoic acid using the nZVIS2O4 particles results in different byproducts than those produced when nZVIBH4 particles are used. The high concentration of phenol compared to hydroxybenzoic acids suggests that OH addition is not the primary oxidation pathway when one is using the nZVIS2O4 particles. It is proposed that sulfate radicals (SO4&#8722;) are produced as a result of hydroxyl radical attack on the sulfite matrix surrounding the nZVIS2O4 particles, with these radicals oxidizing benzoic acid via electron transfer reactions rather than addition reactions.  Low yields of oxidants limit the application of nZVI. It has recently been demonstrated that nZVI oxidative efficiency can be enhanced in presence of ethlylendiaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Additional insight into the nZVI-mediated process has been obtained from comparative studies of degradation of benzoic acid by nZVI particles and Fenton reagents in the absence and presence of EDTA at different pH.  The efficiency of nZVI degradation is significantly hindered by the rapid aggregation of the iron nanoparticles, which may result in a decrease in available reactive surface area. These effects of aggregation can be overcome by surface modification through adsorption of capping agents which provide steric and electrosteric repulsive interactions between particles. Several high molecular weight (HMW) organic polymers have been used for preventing agglomeration of nZVI particles, such as water soluble starch, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and alginate. The degradation capabilities of different functionalized nZVIS2O4 particle were investigated. Iron-based bimetallic particles in which metals such as Pd and Ni have been combined with Fe, have been found to both enhance rates of halogenated organic contaminants reduction and generate more fully dehalogenated products relative to unamended iron. The results presented in this thesis demonstrate that formation of bimetallic particles with nZVI formed from the more cost effective dithionite reduction of ferrous salts also results in dramatic enhancement in reducing ability.  The oxidising ability of nZVIBH4 particles can be enhanced dramatically by addition of polyoxometallates (POMs), redox catalysts which result in enhanced production of hydrogen peroxide. The extent of enhancement is quantified by examination of the oxidation of formic acid (to CO2) and kinetic modelling of the results obtained used to investigate the mechanism of the POM-mediated oxidation process.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nano</field><field name="subject">Iron</field><field name="subject">ZVI</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Terms and processes in translation between Indonesian and English</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Richard K., School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to examine particular problems that the Indonesian language poses for translators, whether translating from Indonesian to English or English to Indonesian. The notation Indonesian~English translation substitutes the swung dash ~ substitutes for the hyphen -. This notation is used in this thesis to indicate translation either from Indonesian to English or from English to Indonesian. It is a convenient way to make it clear when translation is in both directions. A multifaceted approach to translation will enable translation to be viewed in much the same way as the kinds of demands it places on the translator, who needs constantly to be aware of author~reader, source~target culture, syntax, semantics, semiotics, even geography and even politics. The use of metaphor and illustrations to describe the theoretical processes of translation is justified in the same way that imagery is justified in literature. To go a step further, it is important to see through the artificial distinction often made between interpretation and translation, so that translation acquires flexibility and a deeper ethical structure. A symbolic approach may be used by the translator., involving the perception of modules within text, identified with symbols, that can facilitate the process of translation. With Indonesian, the influx of foreign words occurred in three identifiable stages, Sanskrit, Arabic and Dutch/English. In relation to Indonesian~ English translation, the levels of Javanese and the co-existing presence of the Jakarta dialect may be compared to English vocabulary levels, for example Anglo- Saxon versus Latinate forms. This means an awareness of the existence of layers on the part of the translator. It does not imply a match between the layers in each language, philological layers between English and Indonesian, or strict equivalence between one set of borrowings in English and one in Indonesian. The hypothesis put forward is that there are advantages for the translator in being aware of waves of foreign and regional input that are part of the history of Indonesian as well as English, and that there is potential for creative utilisation of the resources of the two languages. Although a match between the layers in each language or strict equivalence between one set of  borrowings in English and one in Indonesianis not implied, it is useful to recognise word origins where this may impact on the appropriate translation. Examination of the corpus presented in this thesis has shown that the history of Indonesian words can readily affect their meaning, while the history of English words may affect the choice of terms/. Nevertheless it has proved difficult to demonstrate any particular effect of the history or layer of meaning on the choice of terminology in translation. It seems that once the Indonesian term has been understood, the translation that will emerge will not particularly be bound by reference to the history of English terminology. The hypothesis then may be reduced to an observation that the derivation of Indonesian terms, like that of English terms, is important in fully understanding the scope of meaning of the terms. The other hypothesis in this thesis is that texts or terms can be viewed as a root system containing various nodes content that the translator can respond to and wrap into the translated version, with the form of the target text possibly differing from that of the source text. The process of translation can be compared to a process of unpackaging various semantic and other elements in a unit to be translated and repackaging them for the target version. The undbundling~rebundling hypothesis is in the end a very practical matter. It aims to enlarge the discretion of the translator to carry over content with judicious changes in form. It is fair to summarise examination of the corpus by concluding that evidence of the need for unbundling~rebundling has not been convincingly presented in this thesis. It is also fair to say that in general the English translation has followed the order of the Indonesian original quite closely, and this means that a process of unbundling~rebundling is often unlikely to be necessary. Nevertheless the validity of the unbundling~rebundling approach remains, and if a text requires this kind of analysis there is ample justification for its use.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesian language - Translating into English</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23080</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and DNA-binding of Metallocyclic Architectures</field><field name="creator">Schilter, David</field><field name="description">PhD</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bioinorganic chemistry</field><field name="subject">supramolecular chemistry</field><field name="subject">DNA recognition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable Management of Central Victorian Mineral Waters</field><field name="creator">Shugg, Andrew James.</field><field name="description">#DEFAULT</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mineral water</field><field name="subject">carbonated water</field><field name="subject">hydrogeology</field><field name="subject">fractured rock flow systems</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090724.115100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The International Development of Performance-Based Building Codes and Their Impact on the Australian Construction Industry in Offshore Trade</field><field name="creator">Mieldazys, Judita.

This is further complicated by the role of the political economy, global sovereignty versus national boundaries, economic status of a country and community needs.  The literature found that 'one size does not fit all'.  Globalisation results in the consideration of global similarities such as standards, harmonisation of laws, international codes and the growth of international organisations.  In addition, there is international pressure to adopt 'performance-based' designs by members of the World Trade Organization countries in order to promote trade.

The examination of market orientation from customer perspective (&#8216;perceived market orientation&#8217;) remains an under-researched topic, particularly within the non-profit sector. The present study seeks to address this research gap through an investigation of the role of &#8216;perceived market orientation&#8217; in affecting &#8216;customer participation&#8217; with churches as the research context.  The use of churches as a research context has become increasingly common in studies of non-profit and services organisations. Although the implementation of marketing techniques in the church context has been extensive, there has been little examination of the effectiveness of these methods in encouraging church participation. Consequently, previous studies in this area have failed to contribute to a theoretical understanding of how marketing can be used to motivate participation. It is thus apparent that there is a need for more research in this area to examine the potential role of concepts such as &#8216;perceived market orientation&#8217; and &#8216;brand image&#8217; in affecting church participation. This research incorporated two stages of research design in the form of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The qualitative phase involved in-depth interviews with Church Goers (CGs) and Non Church Goers (NCGs). Insights gained from the interviews helped the present author to incorporate relevant constructs as predictors of church participation in the conceptual framework. The quantitative phase involved the distribution of self-administered questionnaires using convenience sampling technique. CG respondents were approached through Assemblies of God (AOG) church leaders in Melbourne metropolitan and suburban areas whereas NCG respondents were recruited through newspaper advertisement. A total of 564 usable questionnaires were obtained representing 42% of the total number of respondents approached in both groups. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were employed to establish construct reliability and validity as well as measurement invariance. Subsequently, the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique was employed to analyse the hypothesised relationships between key constructs in the conceptual framework. The results of the study indicate that &#8216;perceived market orientation&#8217; plays an important role in affecting the church participation of both CG and NCG respondents. An examination of corollary hypotheses reveals that &#8216;interfunctional coordination&#8217; performs the strongest effect on church participation. Further, &#8216;customer orientation&#8217; was only found to be significantly associated with church participation in CG group whereas &#8216;competitor orientation&#8217; was not found to be positively associated with church participation in either group of respondents. The &#8216;brand image&#8217; construct in the present study was developed to examine the church&#8217;s ability in creating a unique brand identity (uniqueness), monitoring brand values (reputation), and managing brand communications (orchestration) from the perspectives of existing (CG) and prospective (NCG) members. The analysis found that &#8216;brand image&#8217; is a unidimensional construct which is positively associated with &#8216;perceived market orientation&#8217;, &#8216;perceived benefits&#8217;, and &#8216;church participation&#8217; in both sample groups. The study also examines the significance of &#8216;perceived benefits&#8217; in affecting church participation. The construct was found to be significantly associated with church participation in both sample groups. Among the three dimensions of &#8216;perceived benefits&#8217;, the construct of &#8216;social benefits&#8217; was found to perform the strongest effect on church participation in both sample groups. The present study offers significant practical implications for non-profit managers in general and church leaders in particular. Due to the significance of market orientation and brand image in encouraging customer participation, it is recommended that non-profit managers and church leaders embrace market orientation and brand orientation to reach out their target segments more effectively.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Church marketing</field><field name="subject">Market orientation</field><field name="subject">Brand image</field><field name="subject">Customer participation</field><field name="subject">Perceived benefits</field><field name="subject">Non-profit organisations</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/74962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Problem frames approach to strategic requirements for web services</field><field name="creator">Jha, Anju, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Web Services can be seen from two views ? one that it is a purely technological advance and the other that it is a capability that an organisation can deploy to meet a business objective. Much has been said about the first view but not much has been said about the second view. The underlying premise of this research is that in the context of an ever-increasing competitive environment, an organisation needs to take into account these important aspects: What is the business strategy of the organisation, which adopts Web Services? Does the IT align with the business strategy of the organisation? The aim of this research is to capture and describe business-IT problems in the context of strategic requirements and Web Services. As a means to align a Web Services initiative with business strategy, we propose a Requirements Engineering framework to capture the business objectives of an organisation from strategy to implementation. The methodology that we propose provides a roadmap from business strategy, to the strategic objectives to implementation in four dimensions: innovation, customer relationship management, infrastructure management and financials. The proposed framework extends the e-Business Modelling Ontology (eBMO) of Pigneur and Osterwalder by applying Bleistein et al?s Progression of Problems to understand the strategic objectives and the business context.  We have presented 2 examples as proof of concept. We have experimented with our methodology on Amazon.com and Dell.com ?cases developed from the literature? as these organisations are aggressively pursuing Web Services as a part of their IT and business strategy. We use the Problem Frames approach to capture the business objectives and the problem context of an organisation deploying Web Services and to create a strategic alignment between the business strategy and the information technology. The approach presented in this thesis is used to understand Amazon and Dell?s strategy and strategic objectives. It was possible to capture strategic objectives and the strategic context through combination of the eBMO and Progression of Problems. It was also possible to trace this to Web Services requirement description through application of Problem Frames. The framework combines with Bleistein et al?s Progression of Problems at the strategic level and applies Problem Frames at the operational level. It takes the problem-oriented view of the whole process, but does not apply Problem Frames throughout, at least not in their original formulation by Jackson.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Web services.</field><field name="subject">Business strategy series.</field><field name="subject">Information technology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40886</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment and correction of DEM generation from airborne and space borne radar systems with reference to geo-hazard identification in the Cameron Highlands, Malaysia.</field><field name="creator">Ahmad, Baharin Bin, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research assesses the accuracy of SRTM and AIRSAR DEMs acquired over the mountainous-hillands of Cameron Highlands with DEMs generated from Digital Aerial Photograph (DAP) with a fine (2 m) spatial resolution and height resolution of about 0.5 m. The ground control points used for generating stereo models from the DAP were acquired during field work using GPS which achieved accuracy better than 2 cm in most cases. To overcome the difficulty of overlaying the DEMs with the DAP DEM as no features can be easily identified on both the images, therefore a technique of using transects and contours generated from the DEMs were used to correct the horizontal displacement. For AIRSAR DEM, comparing the accompanying AIRSAR composite images was also employed. These then allowed an analysis of the height accuracy to be undertaken. The height of both the AIRSAR and SRTM DEMs were also corrected by applying Linear Regression Models. These models were produced by comparing pixels obtained from points, profiles and an area. Once again the corrected DEMs were assessed. Finally the extracted profiles and contours from the corrected SRTM and AIRSAR were compared with the reference DEM. From the comparisons, the horizontal errors were found to be about one and the half pixels (138.72 m: for SRTM) to the east and 1 pixel (10 m: for AIRSAR) to the south. The SD of height differences of the SRTM and AIRSAR DEMs using 90% data were 9.2 m and 5.2 m with profiles comparison; 10.4 m and 5.4 m with area comparison; 10.8 m and 2.4 m with GPS GCPs comparison respectively. From the three comparisons, the means of height differences are 5.2 m, 6.1 m and 15.2 m for SRTM and 8.1 m, 8.3 m and 7.9 m for AIRSAR DEM. The results suggest there is height offset in the AIRSAR DEM. When both heights of DEMs were corrected, the generated contours are close to each other and to reference contours. Using contour colours images and height modelling, the corrected DEM was found to have the potential to detect areas that prone to flash floods and mudslides.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">InSAR</field><field name="subject">AIRSAR</field><field name="subject">SRTM</field><field name="subject">DEM</field><field name="subject">Aerial Photograph</field><field name="subject">Digital mapping</field><field name="subject">Surveying -- Data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dispersion of two dimensional coflowing jet in the intermediate field</field><field name="creator">Guo, Hong Wei, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">An analytical dispersion model has been derived to determine the distribution of velocities and concentrations of a tracer in a two-dimensional jet in a coflowing ambient fluid. The particular novelty of this model is that it bridges the gap between near-field (where initial momentum dominates behaviour) and far-field (where ambient turbulence is more important) domains. We describe this domain as the ???intermediate field???. In a literature review of coflowing jets we find several laboratory studies and models which can predict the velocities (and in some cases concentrations) in a 2D jet, however they all have shortcomings. None could fully account for ambient turbulence, and all were strictly near-field, i.e. they are unable to describe behaviour when ambient turbulence dominates the initial shear. A brief review of analytical far-field models was also undertaken. There are standard solutions for the dispersion of a 2D continuous source but none that allow for an initial source momentum or non-uniform velocity. As opposed to the near-field coflow approach used by other researchers we start from the far-field, modifying the simple diffusion models by perturbing the governing equations to allow for the initial momentum. Models are developed for both along-stream velocity and the concentration field of a tracer. From the velocity model, a comparison is made with experimental data available from one researcher (Wang, 1996) and an existing near-field coflow model PJCMERG (Davidson, 1989). The initial conditions (width and excess velocity) for our model are determined by Gaussian curve fitting to an arbitrary point in the near-field. The diffusivity parameter is used to adjust (tune) the model until the centreline velocity profile matches. We can always achieve this match and to a much closer degree than PJCMERG. There are no available laboratory or field data for concentrations of a tracer in a 2D coflowing jet although the near-field model PJCMERG does have a tracer component. We demonstrate how PJCMERG cannot converge to any far-field model, while our model provides a neat transition between the near-field and far-field. We have started the extension of the 2D model to the more common 3D situation although we have yet to carry out any comparisons with other models or data. The model development is included in an appendix for other researchers to pick up.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">two-dimensional jet</field><field name="subject">2D jet</field><field name="subject">fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">fluid mechanics</field><field name="subject">velocity</field><field name="subject">far-field model</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Construction of the National Holocaust Memorial in Berlin</field><field name="creator">Mangos, Simone, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">At the beginning of 1998 the final round of the 1997 Memorial for the Murdered Jews of Europe artists?? competition was taking place in Berlin. As an artist whose work is inspired and realized in direct relation to sites, I became interested in and began to investigate the site designated for the Memorial. I discovered, that the Memorial organizers, comprised of the Federal Government of Germany, the State of Berlin and the ??Citizens Association Memorial for the Murdered Jews of Europe?? (F??rderkreis Denkmal f??r die ermordeten Juden Europas), had omitted any reference to the history of the site, and subsequently misrepresented its contemporary condition and status. To what extent does deceit play a role in the construction of the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe? What bearing does it have on the completed artwork? Taking the site as a starting point, I decided to investigate the above by observing and documenting the actual stages of construction from direct first hand observation as an eye witness. This included the management and promotion of the memorial. The official ten-years long debate (1989-1999) about the memorial ostensibly represented a thorough analysis of the undertaking. But what would take place in the actual practice of constructing the national Holocaust Memorial in the new capital of reunited Germany? What would the intervention, editing and promotion of the object during the years of construction, reflect about the intentions of the German people (the Memorial organizers, the media and the public), and the intended function of the object? How would the German people receive the memorial and what would their response indicate? This research would initially take place prior to construction, as well as during construction, at a time when the realization of the actual memorial was somewhat in jeopardy. Most sections of the thesis would be written immediately following the events that took place. My research did not stop with the inauguration of the memorial, and I was thus able to observe the completed memorial??s existence and address the evident final question. Why does the resulting memorial fail to elicit an appropriate respectful response from the public? In what ways did the management, promotion and editing of, as well as activities on and around the site of the memorial, contribute to this failure? Procedures followed: Prior to formally undertaking the PhD, my investigative procedures were those of an artist and someone outside of the official discussion (without the privileges of the press, an organized lobby group or any officially recognized status) attempting to glean insight, understanding and information, as available to any member of the general public (albeit, as a foreigner). This included weekly visits to the site and photographic documentation and observation of both the allotted terrain and vicinity. Embarking on the formal PhD, the procedure is solidified by a methodical investigation and review of the press in consultation with historical sources and unpublished documents. Parallel to the investigation, I develop an exhibition of artwork that is consequential to the research. I attempt to make the work public through an exhibition in a central state museum in Berlin. General results obtained: A written account, addressing the period of construction of the memorial from 1998 to 2005 and the subsequent reception and life of the completed object, post inauguration. The thesis reconstructs and documents the stages of construction as well as the final outcome of the memorial. A body of artworks comprising sculpture, photography, video and installation has been produced out of the research. Major conclusions reached: An appraisal of the completed memorial??s reception has raised new questions about the finished object two years on from its inauguration. It presents a critical analysis of the completed memorial??s failure in an atmosphere of post World Cup euphoric indifference. A solo exhibition at the only museum in Berlin dedicated in part to a Jewish artist, as well as the opportunity to realize an artwork with a historical building in the central business district of Berlin, which is still in a state of ruin following its bombing at the end of WWII. To my knowledge, this is the only thesis on the memorial, which addresses thefindings of Nazi ruins on site in 1998, their subsequent removal and the quasisecrecy surrounding it, as well as the level of deceit in the construction process and its effects on the resulting memorial. It is the only thesis, which acknowledges and addresses the outright failure of the memorial to elicit a respectful commemoration of the Holocaust.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design of structured nonbinary quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes</field><field name="creator">Liu, Yue, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since the rediscovery, LDPC codes attract a large amount of research efforts. In 1998, nonbinary LDPC codes were firstly investigated and the results shown that they are better than their binary counterparts in performance. Recently, there is always a requirement from the industry to design applied nonbinary LDPC codes.  In this dissertation, we firstly propose a novel class of quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes. This class of QC-LDPC codes embraces both linear encoding complexity and excellent compatibility in various degree distributions and nonbinary expansions. We show by simulation results that our proposed QC-LDPC codes perform as well as their comparable counterparts. However, this proposed code structure is more flexible in designing. This feature may show its power when we change the code length and rate adaptively. Further more, we present two algorithms to generate codes with short girth and better girth distribution. The two algorithms are designed based on progressive edge growth (PEG) algorithm and they are specifically designed for quasi-cyclic structure. The simulation results show the improvement they achieved. In this thesis, we also investigate the believe propagation based iterative algorithms for decoding of nonbinary LDPC codes. The algorithms include sum-product (SP) algorithm, SP algorithm using fast Fourier transform, min-sum (MS) algorithm and complexity reduced extended min-sum (EMS) algorithm. In particular, we present the proposed modified min-sum algorithm with threshold filtering which further reduces the computation complexity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LDPC.</field><field name="subject">Error control coding.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'A sort of middle of the road policy' : forward defence, alliance politics and the Australian Nuclear Weapons Option, 1953-1973</field><field name="creator">Auton, Luke Thomas, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the importance of nuclear weapons to Australian defence and strategic policy in Southeast Asia between 1953 and 1973. It argues that Australia's approach to nuclear issues during this period, and its attitude towards the development and acquisition of nuclear weapons in particular, was aimed exclusively at achieving narrowly defined political objectives. Australia was thus never interested in possessing nuclear weapons, and any moves seemingly taken along these lines were calculated to obtain political concessions - not as part of a 'bid' for their acquirement. This viewpoint sits at odds with the consensus position of several focused studies of Australian nuclear policy published in the past decade. Although in general these studies correctly argue that Australia maintained the 'nuclear weapons option' until the early 1970s, all have misrepresented the motivation for this by contending that the government viewed such weapons in exclusively military terms. The claim that Australia was interested only in the military aspect of nuclear weapons does not pay due attention to the fact that defence planning was based entirely on the provision of conventional forces to Southeast Asia. Accordingly, the military was interested first and foremost with issues arising from extant conventional planning concepts, and the government was chiefly concerned about obtaining allied assurances of support for established plans. The most pressing requirement for Australia therefore was gaining sway over allied countries. However, the Australian government was never in a position to overtly influence more powerful allies against an undertaking that could escalate into limited war, and was similarly incapable of inducing its allies to retain forces in the region in spite of competing pressures. It was for this reason that Australia would seek to manipulate the nuclear weapons option. Indeed, access to such weapons offered Australia the opportunity to achieve greater integration in formulating allied planning, while the threat to manufacture them provided a means of convincing regional partners to maintain a presence in the area. The thesis therefore concludes that Australia carefully presented its options for procuring nuclear weapons to gain influence over its allies in response to strategic developments in Southeast Asia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia : foreign relations</field><field name="subject">Nuclear weapons</field><field name="subject">Australian Defenses</field><field name="subject">Australia : military policy</field><field name="subject">Nuclear weapons , Australian Defenses , Australia : foreign relations , Australia : military policy , Australia : strategic policy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating five models of dissemination of NHMRC 'Guideline depression in young people for GP's' through divisions of general practice</field><field name="creator">Penrose-Wall, Jonine., Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background: Dissemination of evidence-based mental health clinical practice guidelines had not been studied in Australia prior to the National General Practice Guideline Implementation Program. This naturalistic research reports ten national interventions designed to disseminate the NHMRC 1997 Clinical Practice Guideline Depression in Young People for GPs (GDIYP-GP) through 123 Divisions of General Practice. The guideline covered depression and suicide in young people aged 13 to 20 years. Aim: To evaluate a 'coordinated link agent' and 'enhanced packaged approach' for disseminating a national guideline by engaging 20 Divisions in using 5 dissemination models and to measure Divisions' capacities in performing unfunded local dissemination to GPs. Method: An Implementation Kit was the main national intervention, housing the guidelines and 5 models: Education by the Division; Education by an external provider; 3) Clinical Audit; 4) Segmented Formats and 5) Appraisal. Five studies are reported: 1) an organisational census on guideline-related practices in all topics; 2) a Case Study Database of 3 consecutive interviews of 51 participating Divisions; 3) a Guideline Appraisal study of 9 cohorts of doctors; 4) a Clinical Audit study of 54 doctors involving 1200 patients; and 5) a 'Segmented Formats' documentary analysis of Division communications on GDIYP-GP. Results: Prior dissemination by most Divisions was administrative mail outs rather than planned programs. In all, 70 instead of the pilot 20 organisations participated (57% of the sector) using 10,000 guidelines: 45 participated by 7 weeks and 71 by 35 weeks and the majority used multiple active strategies showing fidelity to the Kit. Education by the Division, Segmented Formats and Appraisal were the most adopted models. GDIYP-GP was acceptable and relevant to the majority of Divisions and to 9 samples of doctors. Conclusion: Divisions are one appropriate system through which evidence-based mental health guidelines can be disseminated to general practitioners. Uptake can be rapid using a flexible enhanced package approach with link-agent support. 3-6 months is needed for organisations to begin effective interventions.

It is not a mechanical routine but something essential to my daily life. I go to the piano, and I play two preludes and fugues by Bach??? It is a sort of benediction on the house??? It is a rediscovery of the wonder of which I have the joy of being a part. It fills me with awareness of the wonder of life, with a feeling of the incredible marvel of being a human being. The music is never the same for me, never. Each day it is something new, fantastic, and unbelievable. That is Bach??? a miracle! A whole radiance of space and poetry pours forth from them! They are the very essence of Bach, and Bach is the essence of music. (Casals:1974:17 &amp; 47). Such comments, common among musicians, are usually ignored by the disciplines that study music. This thesis, however, is the result of a decision to take these comments seriously. This thesis addresses the issues of creativity, order and discipline, through the perspective of a sociology and phenomenology of everyday life. The main issues of this thesis are first introduced through Bachelard???s phenomenological study of poetry and Heidegger???s approach to art. Embodied modes of knowing are introduced through Buber???s dialogic I-Thou concept. This is followed by Winnicott???s discussion of creativity and Bohm and Peat???s discussion of order. Discipline is introduced through a counter-analysis of some central sociological theorists on authority and power: Lukes, Foucault and Durkheim. Among other writers influential for the thesis are Eliade on origins, sacred temporality and ???eternal return???, Simmel and Douglas on space, Levinas, Merton, Herrigel and Stendl- Rast on ethics and discipline. Hegel and Sartre on identity-logic and Serres on relational modes of knowing. The main issues are drawn from experiences with music and particularly with the music of J. S. Bach. These experiences raise ontological, cosmological and epistemological questions that are examined in this thesis.

The developed laser-cut stainless steel stencils successfully challenge two of the cell performance limitations associated with commercial screen printing technology: the wide and non-uniform front gridline fingers and low height-to-width aspect ratio of the fingers. These limitations lower the short circuit current density, the fill factor and, in turn, the efficiency of a screen printed solar cell. Metal stencils are capable of printing fine, high and continuous features on the cell front that have a high aspect ratio. Both single-level and double-level structured stainless steel stencils for solar cell front metallization have been developed, with laser-cut double-level stainless steel stencils being demonstrated for the first time worldwide. Both of them are able to print fine, high and continuous gridline pattern to the front surfaces of solar cells in one step, with a certain number of special short bridges being put at the places where fingers meet busbar and along fingers and busbar. The deformation issue of the very thin stainless steel foils due to its thermal expansion in the process of laser cutting is solved by increasing the energy content in each laser pulse that impinges upon the stainless steel foil with changed Q-switch frequencies, while maintaining the laser average output energy in unit time to an optimum value. A chemical etching process has been developed to etch the dross that results from laser cutting, resulting in well formed metal stencils suitable for printing. By a comparison between the metal stencil printed and conventional mesh screen printed silicon solar cells, which are fabricated on similar Cz silicon wafers with a almost identical cell processing sequence except for using different front contact printing masks, the following conclusions are reached: Fired Ag finger lines with 75-??m width on finished solar cells, using a doublelevel stainless steel stencil can be achieved. In contrast, the fired Ag finger line on finished solar cells using a traditional mesh screen is 121-??m wide. The stencil printed finger is smoother and more uniform than by screen printing and the former has a 25-??m fired finger height with a 0.33 height-to-width aspect ratio, compared to a 10-??m fired finger height with a 0.08 height-to-width aspect ratio for the later. With these advantages, the 4-cm2 stencil-printed silicon solar cells has an averaged 1.28 mA/cm2 higher short circuit current and an averaged 5.9% higher efficiency than the 4-cm2 screen printed silicon solar cell, which identifies one of the key advantages of solar cell metallization schemes by using metal stencil printing in place of screen printing. Using a ???feedback alignment??? method for registration of the laser-formed metal stencil printed pattern and the laser-formed groove pattern, Ag paste can be printed and filled into wafer grooves by using a hand-operated without an optical vision system. The fired finger profile is 50-??m wide and 22-??m high. The best metal stencil printed, selective emitter silicon solar cell demonstrates a 34.2 mA/cm2 short circuit current density, 625 mV open circuit voltage, 0.77 fill factor and 16.4% efficiency, with an excellent spectral response at short wavelengths due to its selective emitter cell structure. It is believed that the performance of this type of solar cell can be enhanced with a screen printer that has an optical vision system and an automatic alignment device. The successful development of metal stencil printed silicon solar cells demonstrates the feasibility of the metal stencil printing as a beneficial technology for the PV industry.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">solar cells</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23062</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rural clinical placements for dental students : an action research study</field><field name="creator">Cockrell, Deborah Jane</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dental students -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Dentists -- Employment -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Rural health services -- New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some aspects of the effects of vitamin A deficiency on the rat incisor : with particular reference to eruption of the incisor</field><field name="creator">Sessle, Barry J</field><field name="description">Master of Dental Surgery</field><field name="date">1965</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vitamin A deficiency</field><field name="subject">Incisors</field><field name="subject">Rats</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temporomandibular joint dysfunction syndrome : relationship of fixed appliance orthodontic treatment as a possible aetiological factor</field><field name="creator">Mountain, Keith John</field><field name="description">Master of Dental Surgery</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Occlusion (Dentistry)</field><field name="subject">Orthodontics</field><field name="subject">Temporomandibular joint -- Diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The implications of hepatitis B for dental practice</field><field name="creator">Reed, Barry Edwin</field><field name="description">Master of Dental Surgery</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communicable diseases -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Dentists -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis B -- Prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The linking of a Br&#229;nemark implant to a natural tooth</field><field name="creator">Viljoen, Andr&#233; John</field><field name="description">Master of Dental Surgery</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Endosseous dental implants -- Technique</field><field name="subject">Teeth -- Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4824</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The maxillary nerve in the cat : a study in growth and form</field><field name="creator">Wilson, D.

It particularly explores how the leadership of the Principal can empower others to effect change.      Early interest in the empowering role of leadership arose through experience at Head of Department level, extended by system contribution beyond the school. The conception of the interface between leadership, culture and ethos was cemented by appointment as Foundation Principal of a new Government high school. A passionate commitment to exploring the unique opportunities, and to attempting to resolve the very specific problems of a new school led to collaboration with other Foundation Principals. Subsequently, I undertook a review of the literature and research into the specific issues inherent in the establishment of a school. Data was collected in situ through visits to new schools, across four States in eastern Australia.      This research led to positions of system leadership in new schooling, and to advocacy for a &#8220;new deal&#8221; for establishing schools. The research led to a growing portfolio of articles, two of which have been published in refereed journals. The desired outcome of the research and published papers was to document some initiatives which could be undertaken by leadership teams in schools as they sought to establish effective culture and ethos in the early years of their schools. My experience in schools identified the position of Head of Department as a critical, gatekeeping position for the cultivation or resistance of desired change in schools. Accordingly, I was part of a research study which employed a Grounded Theory methodology (Strauss and Corbin, 1990) and gathered data through telephone interviews. The research found Heads of Department typically distracted, by the sheer weight of tasks endemic to their role, from the major focus on curriculum and quality teaching and learning. Three refereed journal articles to which I contributed, one as lead author, sought to reconceptualise the role. Educational systems have shown considerable interest in this research. A focus on Heads of Department led fairly naturally to an attempt to identifying other agencies within a school which could lead to cultural change. Specifically, further research sought to identify initiatives available to the leadership team as it sought to enhance curriculum provision and student outcomes. This represented an attempt to apply the very considerable literature to develop some cutting edge initiatives, and led to further journal contributions, one of which was refereed. Other schools have shown considerable interest in these initiatives. A change of situation from the Government to the Independent schooling system provided a new practical and research challenge: how to undertake Christian education which was authentic, in the sense that it was truly educative and not indoctrinative, and was effective in transmitting Christian values. The literature in the field was not encouraging in terms of the efficacy of schools&#8217; Christian education programs in effecting values change, or of the ethical integrity of their pedagogy. The apparent deficits in models of Christian education presented in schools, as revealed in the literature, gave rise to a number of research studies in my own school, which, as an outcome, has sought to reconceptualise the school&#8217;s approach to Christian education. This attempted reconceptualisation has been documented in a number of journal articles and publications, two co-authored and refereed, in an attempt to provide some exemplars which may be influential in other schools. The overall thesis of this dissertation is that when the Principal seeks to empower and mobilize other members of the school leadership team, including key teachers and parents, effective change can occur in the school&#8217;s culture and ethos. These changes in turn can feature a range of initiatives which substantially improve learning outcomes for students.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational leadership</field><field name="subject">school management and organization</field><field name="subject">total quality management in education.</field><field name="subject">professional ethics</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/22480</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Galen, Rome and the Second Sophistic</field><field name="creator">Elliott, Christopher Jon</field><field name="description">Galen of Pergamum is principally famous for his works on anatomy, medicine and moral philosophy.  He is also noted for his acerbic temperament, his affirmations of his own brilliance and his denigration of the education, morals and lifestyle of his medical opponents and of anyone who viewed differently the things that he held dear.  On his arrival in Rome he used a variety of techniques reminiscent of those used by the sophists in order to establish his place amongst the social and intellectual elite both as a physician and as a philosopher.  At this and later points in his career his rhetoric emphasised the quality of his Greek education  which included a thorough grounding in mathematics. He also appealed to his philosophic lifestyle and to his social connections in Rome in order to differentiate himself from the general run of doctors and to promote his own agenda.  In this dissertation I examine his writings with the object of testing the validity of Galen&#146;s claims in these areas and, in the process, to come to a deeper understanding the social and intellectual environments that formed him and with which he interacted.  Special attention is given to his literary and rhetorical education and his knowledge of the exact sciences. One consequence of studying his training in rhetoric was the reconstruction of a rhetorical template which, though of a kind possibly mentioned in passing by Quintilian, is not to be found in any of the extant manuals on rhetoric.  In the matter of the exact sciences particular consideration is given to his knowledge of geometry and the construction of sundials, as his views on these subjects form the foundation to his approach to philosophical and medical knowledge. Thus a substantial section is devoted to the manner in which Galen could have gained his certainty in these matters.
&#182;
Galen's rhetoric also makes much of his family's social status and his personal
relationship to the royal court. These matters are examined in relationship to our
present knowledge of Greek society and the familia Caesaris at the time. A
consequence of this latter enquiry was some insights into the work habits of
Marcus Aurelius.
&#182;
Galen not only wished to be known as Rome's leading physician and anatomist
but also as one who practised the philosophic lifestyle. The background to
Galen's decision in this last matter is assessed together with an examination of
passages that while suggesting that much of his language and sentiment was a
reflection of Platonic values also show that his commitment to a life of asceticism
was real.
&#182;
What also emerges in this study is that there was considerable tension between
the world in which he wished to live and the world as it was. This shows
especially in his aggressive rejection of the salutatio and other Roman social
conventions, his frustration at the early reception of his medical theories and
teaching, and his desire to sustain the educated koine Greek of his homeland
against the social pressures which were attempting to restrict educated Greek to
the dialect and vocabulary of ancient Attica.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Galen</field><field name="subject">rhetoric</field><field name="subject">Second Sophistic</field><field name="subject">Rome</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090724.145900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural analysis of low melting organic salts an approach to ionic liquid design</field><field name="creator">Dean, Pamela Mary</field><field name="description">Ionic liquid forming compounds often display low melting points (a lack of crystallisation at ambient temperature and pressure) due to decreased lattice energies in the crystalline state. The degree of anion-cation contact with respect to the type, strength and number of interactions is a major factor determining the lattice energies, melting point and general behaviour of ionic liquid forming salts. Intermolecular interactions between the anion and cation and the conformational states of each component of the salt are of interest since distinctive properties ascribed to ionic liquids are determined to a significant extent by these interactions. The direct insight into the spatial relationship between cation and anion provided by the analysis of crystal structures provides a basis from which features of the ionic liquid can be generally understood, since the short range order and interactions of related, non-crystalline compounds may be similar to those of the crystalline form. However, it is difficult to predict whether a particular ionic pair will produce a liquid at room temperature, due to numerous possible combinations of cations and anions and the subtleties of their interactions. Crystal engineering is the ability to assemble molecular or ionic components into the desired crystalline architecture by engineering a target network of supramolecular interactions known as synthons. In this investigation the problem of ionic liquid design is addressed using the concepts of crystal engineering in an inverse sense, the so-called anti crystal-engineering approach. A topical area in which the anti crystal-engineering concept may be of some value is that of Ionic Liquid Phases of Pharmaceutically Active Ions (Active Ionic Liquids). Thus, by using the knowledge gained of the intermolecular interactions, packing and ionic conformation which occur within &#8216;traditional&#8217; ionic liquids, combined with the knowledge of which functional group combinations yield supramolecular synthons resulting in crystalline subjects, and the subsequent prevention thereof (anti crystal-engineering), appropriate ions shall be selected which may result in ionic liquid formation. The intermolecular interactions of a series of: &#8226; crystallised bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (NTf2) and bis(methanesulfonyl)amide (NMes2) ionic liquids,  &#8226; low melting N-alkyl-2-methyl-3-benzylimidazolium iodide salts with a range of alkyl chain lengths, from n=1 to 6 and including both n-butyl and s-butyl chains, &#8226; 1-methyl-1-propylpyrrolidinium chloride and,  &#8226; a number of low melting salts containing trihalide and monohalide ions, in combination with typical IL organic cations namely, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium, 1-ethyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium and 1-propyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium, were qualitatively investigated and/or compared using a combination of crystallographic, Hirshfeld surface and thermal analysis techniques. The NMes2 salts are known to exhibit higher glass transitions and higher viscosities than those of the NTf2 salts.  The origins of these differences were analysed in terms of the importance of factors such as the C-H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O hydrogen bond, fluorination, presence of an aromatic moiety and length of alkyl chain, using the Hirshfeld surfaces and their associated fingerprint plots. Additionally, the existence of C-F&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; and C-H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; interactions were elucidated and the significance of anion-anion interactions was recognised. Thermal analysis of the N-alkyl-2-methyl-3-benzylimidazolium iodide salts revealed that the methyl- and (s-)butyl substituted salts have a significantly higher melting point than the rest of the series. Analysis of these crystal structures allowed examination of the influence of the substitutions on the different cation-anion and cation-cation interactions and thus the physical properties of the salts. Thermal analysis of the monohalide and trihalide salts revealed that the tribromide salts are lower melting than their monohalide analogues. Analysis of these crystal structures revealed the influence of the anions and the crystal packing on the physical properties of the salts. A series of crystalline and liquid salts were prepared from cations and anions drawn from Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) materials. The solid-state structures of the crystalline salts were used as a basis for the anti-crystal engineering approach in the preparation of several &#8220;Active Ionic Liquids&#8221; (AILs). However, a side product also resulted during the synthetic route namely, methyl 9H-xanthene-9-carboxylate, a side product resulting from the API, propantheline. The results and methodology of the anti-crystal engineering procedure and the subsequent successful preparation and characterization of pharmaceutical ionic compounds are reported herein.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ionic liquid</field><field name="subject">Low melting salts</field><field name="subject">Hirshfeld analysis</field><field name="subject">Crystallographic analysis</field><field name="subject">Pharmaceutical salts</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/75056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and application of an in vitro physicochemical upper gastrointestinal system (IPUGS) simulating the human digestive processes</field><field name="creator">Yoo, Ji Yeon</field><field name="description">Increased and combined knowledge of food processing, molecular biology, health and nutrition has triggered production of many different types of functional foods and pharmaceutics recently. The efficacy and safety of such products are being assessed prior to marketing by in vivo and/or in vitro studies. Traditional in vivo studies require excessive time, cost and labour, as well as ethical approvals with subject to humans or animals in some instances. Therefore excessive number of runs may be avoided if reliable in vitro system is available. During the course of this study, an in vitro physicochemical upper gastrointestinal tract system (IPUGS), the first of its kind in literature, has been developed to simulate the relevant conditions of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) as closely as possible to the human physiology with multi-disciplinary approach, combining biology, physiology, gastroenterology, process technology, chemical engineering and automation. The IPUGS is aimed at having a high predictive capability towards the real digestion processes occurring in the human upper GIT which allows for examining of the bioavailability of nutrients and drugs, drug-nutrient interactions, viability of probiotics and case studies of gastrointestinal disorders. Digestion of rice and baby foods have been studied with the IPUGS by UV-spectrophotometer, HPLC, light microscope and pH meter under the  conditions of normal state and common gastric disorders, such as gastroparesis, dumping syndrome, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and hypochlorhydria. By comparing the data from many physiological and clinical sources in the literature, it would seem that the IPUGS was able to generate more reliable data compared to the existing in vitro digestion (mechanical) models in the literature. In future, computer-controlled and computer-recorded data by possibly designing a new software or equations would be desirable to implicate a better understanding of the digestive processes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">In vitro digestion model</field><field name="subject">IPUGS</field><field name="subject">Rice analyses</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/75065</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of ethical decision-making : a study of Thai managers and professionals in Bangkok and provincial Thailand</field><field name="creator">Youngsamart, Daungdauwn</field><field name="description">Academics and social commentators have emphasised the importance of religion and specific cultural characteristics in influencing or explaining the perceptions, values and behaviours of cultural groups. The quantitative empirical research into ethical perceptions, intentions and behaviours has used culture and religion to define cultural groups, or compare and contrast two national cultural groups.  Little focus has been placed on intra-cultural differences.  While there has been some quantitative empirical research into the role of Thai Buddhist religiosity in ethical decision making, there has been no such research that deals with the unique Thai cultural characteristics of greng jai and patron-client relationships or differences between urban and provincial Thai managers and professionals. In the research conducted for this thesis, I explore the relationship between Thai Buddhist religiosity, patron-client relationships and greng jai, and ethical intentions, expectations of other&#8217;s behaviour and  the nature of ethical dilemmas (ethical or unethical). In addition, intra-cultural differences between &#8216;Thai managers and professionals in Bangkok and &#8216;less developed&#8217; provinces on these items are investigated.  Survey responses from 522 Thai managers and professionals from Bangkok and provincial Thailand were obtained in the research conducted for this thesis. The instrument used includes five scenarios from previous research, two new scenarios that address greng jai and patron-client relationship dilemmas, demographic and cultural measures, and measures of ethical intentions, behaviour of others, and the nature of the ethical problem. Neither patron-client relationships nor greng jai were found to influence ethical intentions, perception of other&#8217;s behaviour or perception of the nature of ethical problems. This suggests that importance of these cultural characteristics has been exaggerated in previous qualitative research, that these previously important characteristics are no longer important, or that Thai managers and professionals insulate their ethical perceptions in business settings from Thai cultural influences. The latter explanation would indicate convergence of Thai business culture with a more modern globalised perception of business ethics.  Thai Buddhist religiosity did not consistently play a role in perceptions of ethical intention, behaviour of others or the nature of the problems. In scenarios in which it did play a role, the effect was small. Again, this suggests that the importance of religiosity may have been exaggerated in the past, was once important but is no longer so, or that Thai managers and professionals compartmentalise the role of religion in business and non-business settings.  No differences were found between Thai managers and professionals in Bangkok and provincial Thailand. Again, this suggests a convergence with a modern globalised perception of business ethics.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business ethics</field><field name="subject">National culture</field><field name="subject">Intra-cultural difference</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Management decision making</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/75075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The professionalisation of Australian catholic social welfare, 1920-1985</field><field name="creator">Gleeson, Damian John, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the neglected history of Australian Catholic social welfare, focusing on the period, 1920-85. Central to this study is a comparative analysis of diocesan welfare bureaux (Centacare), especially the Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide agencies. Starting with the origins of professional welfare at local levels, this thesis shows the growth in Catholic welfare services across Australia. The significant transition from voluntary to professional Catholic welfare in Australia is a key theme. Lay trained women inspired the transformation in the church???s welfare services. Prepared predominantly by their American training, these women devoted their lives to fostering social work in the Church and within the broader community. The women demonstrated vision and tenacity in introducing new policies and practices across the disparate and unco-ordinated Australian Catholic welfare sector. Their determination challenged the status quo, especially the church???s preference for institutionalisation of children, though they packaged their reforms with compassion and pragmatism. Trained social workers offered specialised guidance though such efforts were often not appreciated before the 1960s. New approaches to welfare and the co-ordination of services attracted varying degrees of resistance and opposition from traditional Catholic charity providers: religious orders and the voluntary-based St Vincent de Paul Society (SVdP). For much of the period under review diocesan bureaux experienced close scrutiny from their ordinaries (bishops), regular financial difficulties, and competition from other church-based charities for status and funding. Following the lead of lay women, clerics such as Bishop Algy Thomas, Monsignor Frank McCosker and Fr Peter Phibbs (Sydney); Bishop Eric Perkins (Melbourne), Frs Terry Holland and Luke Roberts (Adelaide), consolidated Catholic social welfare. For four decades an unprecedented Sydney-Melbourne partnership between McCosker and Perkins had a major impact on Catholic social policy, through peak bodies such as the National Catholic Welfare Committee and its successor the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission. The intersection between church and state is examined in terms of welfare policies and state aid for service delivery. Peak bodies secured state aid for the church???s welfare agencies, which, given insufficient church funding proved crucial by the mid 1980s.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Church charities -- Australia -- Catholic Church -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Social service -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Social workers -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Volunteer workers in social service -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Professions -- Social aspects -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating factors that influence carbon dissolution from Coke into Molten iron.</field><field name="creator">Cham, S. Tsuey, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The need for more efficient blast furnaces is even greater now that there are stricter environmental regulations on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Coke within the blast furnace not only supports the furnace bed and allows gas flow, it also carburises liquid iron. The carburisation of iron is one of the most important reactions and must be better understood if the ironmaking process in the blast furnace is to be made more sustainable. By understanding what coke properties influence the rate at which coke dissolves in iron we can predict a coke?s performance and use it to determine its quality.  As carbon dissolution rates have only been determined for a few cokes, a systematic and comprehensive study was conducted on the dissolution of carbon from nine Australian cokes into liquid iron. The kinetics of carbon dissolution from Cokes A to I was measured and a range of experimental techniques were used to elucidate the dominant rate influencing factors. The role of coke structure, coke inorganic matter composition and yield and temperature were investigated. Furthermore, the influence of interfacial products and dynamic wettability studies were also conducted.  The carburiser cover method was used to measure carbon pick-up as a function of time over the temperature range of 1450-1550 ??C. Fundamental data on the apparent carbon dissolution rate constant (K) in molten iron at 1550 ??C for Cokes A to I were obtained and ranged from K (x 103 s-1) = 0.47 to K (x 103 s-1) = 14.7. The wide variation in K showed that not all cokes dissolve at similar rates. In fact one of the nine cokes in this investigation dissolved at a rate comparable to graphite dissolution rates.  The apparent carbon dissolution activation energy, Ea, for two of the nine cokes plus synthetic graphite (SG) was also determined. The Ea obtained for SG (Ea = 54 kJ / mol) was in agreement with literature values and was consistent with a diffusion controlled mechanism. The observed Ea values for Cokes D and F (313 kJ / mol and 479 kJ / mol respectively) are an order of magnitude larger than the Ea obtained for SG. The difference in Ea between cokes and SG does not appear to be solely due to differences in the structure of the carbon source. The difference in Ea between the cokes was attributed to differences in their inorganic matter composition. The interfacial contact area is a function of inorganic matter yield and composition, which in turn is a function of temperature. Therefore, as temperature decreases the slag / ash layer produced at the carbon / iron interface can increase in area and viscosity and thus hinder carbon dissolution and transfer, and increasing the apparent activation energy for carbon dissolution. Thus, the differences in viscosity and melting temperature of the interfacial product play a key role.  Wettability experiments were carried out using the sessile drop technique. The wettability of Cokes D, F and G with liquid iron at 1550 ??C was measured as a function of time. All three coke samples showed non-wetting behaviour with contact angles ranging between 123-129?? in the initial stages and between 109-114?? after two hours of contact. The differences in the wettability of the three coke samples could not explain the large differences in dissolution rates observed between these cokes. Thus, the wettability of these coke samples was not considered a dominant factor in influencing the rate of carbon dissolution.  The sessile drop technique was also used to study the interfacial products formed at the coke / iron interface. The interfacial products formed on the underside of the iron droplet after contact with Cokes F and G were initially different in regards to the morphology and chemical composition. The interfacial product formed with Coke G had a network or mesh like structure that seemed to wet the iron droplet much better than the interfacial product formed with Coke F. In contrast, Fe globules and discrete interfacial products were observed in Coke F. It was suggested that this was due to differences in inorganic matter content, especially in calcium (Ca) and sulfur (S) content in the coke.  Formation of interfacial products containing sulfides, such as calcium sulfide (CaS) and manganese sulfide (MnS), were observed on the iron side of the interface of both Cokes F and G. As a result, the interfacial products can act as a physical barrier blocking iron and coke contact, thus reducing the contact area for carbon dissolution and decreasing the rate of carbon dissolution. The presence of MnS may act to lower the liquidus temperature of the interfacial product, which in turn can affect the overall viscosity of the interfacial layer. Thus, the deposition of reaction products at the interfacial region can have a significant effect on carbon dissolution rates.  The mineral pyrrhotite was also identified as a significant factor in influencing the rate of carbon dissolution. Electron dispersive X-ray analyses of Coke F identified iron to be in close association with sulfur. These Fe / S species have atomic ratio similar to pyrrhotite (Fe1-xS) or troilite (FeS). Pyrrhotite in coke can decompose to release gaseous sulfur and metallic iron, which can be carburised by carbon in the surrounding area to form Fe-C particles. Thus, carburisation of liquid iron can occur via Fe-C particles.  There was little difference in structure between the nine coke samples and therefore the high dissolution rates of Coke F, cannot be explained on the basis of crystallite size or anisotropic carbon content. Inorganic matter yield and composition were identified as the dominant rate influencing factors on carbon dissolution. More specifically: - High content of iron phases, such as iron oxides and pyrrhotite, can lead to an increase in carbon dissolution rates. This maybe due to increased amounts of Fe-C particles that are formed upon the reduction of magnetite and decomposition of pyrrhotite, and carried through the slag layer to carburise the bulk liquid iron. - High aluminium oxide content can lead to a decrease in carbon dissolution rates. This maybe due to higher ash fusion / melting temperature or decrease in wettability, both of which lead to a decrease in carbon / iron contact area. - Formation of interfacial products, such as CaS and MnS, can lead to a decrease in carbon dissolution rates. Such products can act as a physical barrier blocking iron and coke contact, thus reducing the contact area for carbon dissolution. However, the presence of MnS may act to lower the liquidus temperature of the interfacial product. - An increase in temperature increases the rate of carbon dissolution. This dependence is predominantly due to the composition of the inorganic matter present in cokes, which influences the viscosity and melting point of the interfacial product formed and hence contact area between coke and iron.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liquid iron.</field><field name="subject">Coke -- Carbonization.</field><field name="subject">Carbon.</field><field name="subject">Wetting.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40685</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antiviral shRNA (for HIV-1)</field><field name="creator">McIntyre, Glen J, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Human Immunodeficiency Virus type I (HIV-1) is an RNA virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Gene therapy is a new treatment paradigm that aims to modify the patient???s cells with therapeutic agents to reduce viral replication and disease progression. A recently discovered technology with potential application in gene therapy for HIV-1 is the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway; a natural gene suppression mechanism where a 19 ??? 21 bp dsRNA trigger prevents the translation of complementary target RNAs. The RNAi pathway can be harnessed artificially with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs or hairpins); expressed RNA transcripts that fold into ???hairpin??? configurations by virtue of selfcomplementary regions separated by a short ???loop??? sequence. The aim of this project was to use pre-clinical models to investigate shRNA design, construction, screening and coexpression for potential use as an anti-HIV-1 therapeutic agent. A PC2-rated assay using multiple fluorescent reporters was developed to screen shRNAs for anti-HIV-1 suppressive activity, simultaneously measuring, and distinguishing, between target-specific and nonspecific shRNA activities. Phi29 DNA polymerase was used to modify the primer extension method for constructing shRNA vectors, increasing its efficiency whilst maintaining its cost effectiveness. A novel sequencing procedure using a restriction enzyme loop sequence was developed, which allowed the sequence of all shRNA vectors to be confirmed at highthroughput automated sequencing facilities. A comprehensive study of hairpin design factors showed that whilst shRNA stem length could affect processing and activity, sequence composition was the critical determinant of suppressive activity. Using the screening and construction methods developed here, many hairpins were designed and tested with at least one highly active hairpin found for each HIV-1 gene. Pre-existing and novel shRNA co-expression strategies were successfully used to co-express up to 4 hairpins to theoretically counter the emergence of viral escape mutants. Overall, this work has shown that expressed shRNAs are potentially suitable to treat HIV-1, since highly active shRNAs can be designed against all HIV-1 genes, shRNA vectors can be efficiently constructed, shRNA activities can be effectively screened and shRNAs can be combined to suppress simultaneously multiple targets.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35215</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Omega-3 fatty acids and depression in the perinatal period</field><field name="creator">Rees, Anne-Marie, Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Omega-3 fatty acids are increasingly recognised as playing an important role in human brain development and mental health. The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) include omega-3 and omega-6 fats which are essential fatty acids (EFAs), consumed via the diet. Omega-3 fatty acids are particularly abundant in fish oils.  The omega-3 fatty acids are being focused on for their role in depression, the main types being docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which is abundant in neural tissue, and also eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) which is biologically very active.  There is an emerging literature in relation to omega-3 fatty acid blood levels in depression and the effects of treatment with omega-3. Strong epidemiological evidence has also been published indicating an association between a population's fish intake and depression rates. A specific research focus on omega-3 as a treatment for depression in the perinatal period is also starting to emerge. The importance of this particular area is enhanced by the knowledge that omega-3 depletion occurs during the perinatal period due to fetal diversion for neurodevelopment.  In view of the lay public promotion of omega-3 and its appeal to women as a 'natural therapy', there is a need to scientifically evaluate its effectiveness to treat depression in the perinatal period. It is also important to investigate omega-3 as an alternative to antidepressants given the ongoing uncertainties regarding their safety in pregnancy.  In this thesis a literature review presents current research relating to this field. This is followed by a description of the methodology and results for the two trials conducted. The results of the double-blind randomised placebo controlled trial of omega-3 as a treatment for depression in the perinatal period were essentially negative. However this result is limited by the small sample size in the study and therefore it may be unwise to interpret the result as conclusive. The case-control study confirmed the hypothesis that omega-3 levels were more depleted in depressed women compared to non-depressed women. A discussion of the results and trial limitations then follows in the thesis. It is concluded that further larger studies are warranted in this area.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polyunsaturated fatty acids</field><field name="subject">Omega-3 fatty acids</field><field name="subject">Postnatal depression</field><field name="subject">Depression</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Victoria per mentum : psychological operations conducted by the Australian Army in Phuoc Tuy Province South Vietnam 1965-1971</field><field name="creator">De Heer, Derrill, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">'Victoria per Mentum : Psychological Operations Conducted by the Australian Army in Phuoc Tuy Province South Vietnam 1965-1971' examines the Australian Army's conduct of psychological operations from 1965 to 1971 in South Vietnam. The study traces the first instances of psychological warfare in 1965, aided by the Americans, through to the establishment of 1 Psychological Operations Unit in April 1970 until November 1971, when Australians withdrew from South Vietnam. Most soldiers in the unit had no training in the art or practice of psychological warfare.  Successes in the American sponsored South Vietnam amnesty program (Chieu Hoi) mirrored the success on the battlefield by Australian fighting soldiers. Psychological Warfare is a non-lethal weapon which has a multiplier effect on the enemy in the battle space. The inability to effectively demonstrate conclusively the effects of successful psychological warfare operations added to uncertainty and scepticism over the weapon's potential and actual impact on the battlefield.  Conventional military leaders rejected psychological warfare as 'paper bullets' that had little or no place in a military focused agenda - shoot, blast bomb, fragment, kill and capture to defeat the enemy. Propaganda and counter-propaganda are examined to demonstrate how these effects influenced each side. The study examines difficulties the Australian 1 Psychological Operations Unit encountered when trying to provide demonstrable and tangible indicators, which meant that when forces to choose between leaflets, loudspeakers and firepower, combat leaders chose firepower. The result was that psychological warfare proved successful only in a limited tactical sense but never created the type of operational or strategic success sought by traditional weapons proponents.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Propaganda</field><field name="subject">Vietnam War : Phuoc Tuy Province</field><field name="subject">Psychological warfare</field><field name="subject">Australian Army : 1 Psychological Operations Unit</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Upgrading and commissioning of a high vacuum deposition system for the evaporation of silicon thin-film solar cells</field><field name="creator">Wolf, Michael, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Using electron beam evaporation for the production of polycrystalline silicon (pc-Si) thin-film solar cells is an attractive alternative to PECVD deposition. Due to its faster deposition rate, using evaporation technology could significantly reduce module production costs. Other advantages are lower running costs, and the fact that no toxic gases are involved. However, currently no on-shelf equipment is available, and research in this field often relies on in-house designed systems. These can have various problems with reliability, deposition uniformity, and due to their custom design require frequent maintenance.  In this work, a newly purchased electron beam evaporation system was upgraded and redesigned to be capable of depositing amorphous Si diodes for the fabrication of pc-Si thin-film solar cells. The main goal of the upgrade was to provide a safe and reliable tool which allows for the deposition of high purity semiconductor material. Reliable and safe operation was accomplished by designing the entire electrical supply circuit and incorporating various safety interlocks. Source cross-contamination issues were addressed by installing a specially designed shroud (source housing). To provide uniform substrate temperatures up to 600??C, a heater was specially designed, fabricated, installed and tested. Accurate design of all mechanical system components was realised by using 3D product design software (ProEngineer).  The new evaporator was commissioned, which included testing and calibration of all the system components required for depositing on substrate sizes of up to 10x10cm2. Over this area a Si film thickness uniformity of +/-2%, performed with a maximum deposition rate of 7nm/s was achieved. Initial experiments using solid phase crystallisation and rapid thermal annealing revealed a sheet resistance uniformity of +/-4% for the Phosphorus and +/-7% for the Boron dopant effusion cell. Experimentation via Raman spectrometry and X-ray diffraction has revealed good crystalline properties, of the crystallised Si films, which is comparable to those of existing evaporation systems. Although the system was upgraded to achieve deposition pressures below 3x10-7 mbar, experiments have shown that this quality of vacuum may not be necessary for the fabrication of low impurity films. The system is now ready for further research in the field of thin-film photovoltaics, and the first functioning devices have been fabricated.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evaporation.</field><field name="subject">Silicon.</field><field name="subject">Electron beam.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flexibility in investment decisions under uncertainty: do managers behave according to real options theory?</field><field name="creator">Collins, Michael Alan, Strategy &amp; Entrepreneurship, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite the plethora of theoretical papers on real options, comparatively few papers test the predictions of real option theory empirically, and almost none directly examine decision making that applies real options theory. In contributing to the understanding of real options thinking, this research addresses the direct question of whether or not managers behave according to real options theory under controlled experimental conditions.  An additional contribution of this research is in the use of discrete choice experimentation as an instrument for studying real options decision-making. Whether managers would value two-stage capital investment decisions??as predicted by real options theory??was tested, as was the extent to which their preferences aligned with theory.  Managers?? responses corresponded, in part, with real options theory: investment values generally increased with lower option premiums and with higher payoffs. However, responses deviated significantly from real options theory when assessing the effect of uncertainty: respondents tended to incorrectly allocate lower values to investment alternatives with higher uncertainty. Responses also deviated significantly when assessing the effect of time to expiry: respondents tended to incorrectly allocate lower values to investment alternatives with longer times to expiry. This aspect is fundamental to real options theory and thus the findings of this research do not support real options thinking as being the best approximation of behaviour.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Control of a rotary blood pump</field><field name="creator">Karantonis, Dean, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Implantable rotary blood pumps (RBPs) are an emerging technology designed to provide sufferers of heart failure with a viable treatment option which improves their medical prognosis and quality of life. The broad aim of this thesis is to address the need for a pump control strategy, and develop a solution whereby the implant recipient??s physiological requirements are continuously monitored in a non-invasive manner and met with an appropriate response by the RBP.  Employing only the non-invasive signal of instantaneous pump impeller speed to assess flow dynamics, five physiologically significant pumping states have been identified in acute ex vivo porcine experiments (N=6). Two broader states, corresponding to normal and ventricular suction conditions, were readily discernable in clinical data from human implant recipients (N=10). Employing a classification and regression tree (CART) model, an automated real-time algorithm was developed to detect pumping states with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. Both suction and normal states were detected without error in data from the animal experiments, and with a peak sensitivity/specificity, for detecting suction, of 99.11% / 98.76% in the human patient data.  Algorithms to non-invasively estimate RBP flow and differential pressure in both steady- and pulsatile-flow environments were developed. Taking the pump feedback signals of speed and power, together with the blood haematocrit (or equivalent viscosity) level, as input parameters, several estimation models were developed via polynomial surface fitting and/or system identification methods, yielding clinically acceptable results (mean flow errors of 3.09% and 5.49%, and mean pressure errors of 1.80% and 6.47%, for the steady- and pulsatile-flow cases, respectively).  An RBP control algorithm based on a non-invasive indicator of the implant recipient??s activity level has been proposed and evaluated in a software simulation environment. An Activity Level Index (ALI) forms the basis of an adaptive control module operating within a hierarchical multi-objective framework which imposes several constraints on the pump??s operating region. Three class IV heart failure cases of varying severity were simulated under rest and exercise conditions, and a comparison with other popular RBP control strategies was performed. Simulations of the proposed control algorithm exhibited the effective intervention of each constraint, resulting in an improved flow response and the maintenance of a safe operating condition, compared with other control modes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Prospect of Independence: A critique and proposal for responding to youth homelessness in South Australia</field><field name="creator">Goudie, Sharyn Leanne</field><field name="description">The lack of resources a young person brings with them to their experience of being homeless dramatically impacts on their ability to get out of homelessness. Young people who become homeless come with limited experience of successful independent living and at a life stage in which they are still developing physically, intellectually and psychologically. Johnson (2006) found that the younger a person was when they first became homeless the more likely they would remain homeless for a longer period of time. Evidence also shows that the longer someone remains homeless the more likely it is that they will develop substance use and/or mental health issues, further reducing their opportunities to &#145;get out&#146; of homelessness.
Youth homelessness disrupts schooling and limits future opportunities for economic participation, placing these young people well and truly at the bottom of the labour market. This paper asks &#145;&#147;Given that young people follow a unique pathway to homelessness, what supports and services are needed to effectively respond to this
group?&#148;

This paper is divided into three sections &#150; a critique of the characteristics of young

As a prominent contemporary organization for Maori development, relevant theory locates runanga with regard to a broader developmental framework and their potential to function within it. The position of runanga, as a facilitator of Maori development, is assessed with reference to Dependency theory, World Systems theory and Modes of Production. These theories highlight the systematic historic dis-empowerment of Maori through the processes of colonisation with particular regard to runanga. The thesis also considers the evolution of the runanga since its migration from Hawaiki, its utilisation as a forum of colonial resistance, its co-option into the governmental system and its contemporary resurgence. This provides a historical overview of the runanga as an institution. In addition, Te Runanga 0 Ngati Whitikaupeka has been used as the case study which considers the issues of becoming a runanga and includes what the structure of the runanga might look like for Ngati Whitikaupeka as an iwi. The theories of Community Development and Empowerment are offered as means to counter the further dis-empowerment of Maori, where institutions such as runanga can utilise these notions to facilitate positive outcomes for iwi and Maori development. Field research contained in this thesis identifies some of the specific concerns and aspirations of Ngati Whitikaupeka iwi members. In utilising the notions of empowerment and community development the field research provides an explicit statement of Iwi aspirations to maintain the connection between Ngati Whitlkaupeka Iwi members at the flax-roots and Te Runanga 0 Ngati Whitikaupeka as a representative body that can facilitate those aspirations. Supplementary to this the iwi aspirations that have been identified in this study are intended to provide some direction for the runanga as the representative decision-making body moving into the future.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Governance</field><field name="subject">Community development</field><field name="subject">Maori empowerment</field><field name="subject">Dependency theory</field><field name="subject">World systems theory</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360202 Public administration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The systematics, palaeobiology and palaeoecology of Kambara taraina sp. nov. from the Eocene Rundle Formation, Queensland</field><field name="creator">Buchanan, Lucas Allen</field><field name="description">A recently excavated bonebed in the Kerosene Creek Member of the Eocene Rundle Formation has yielded an abundance of crocodilian material. Fossils representing nearly all osteological elements, both cranial and postcranial, have been recovered and described. The described cranial remains are clearly indicative of a new species, Kambara taraina. This new species belongs to the earliest known genus of an endemic Australasian group, the Mekosuchinae, a group which radiated in Australasia during the mid to late Cenozoic and utilized various morphologies to exploit a range of ecologic niches. The early Cenozoic remains poorly known with respect to vertebrates and so this discovery of a new Eocene form is significant, showcasing a large sample of well-preserved material. Cranial material reveals functional divergence among the species of early mekosuchines, reflecting subtle partitioning of feeding strategies. The enlarged insertion area in the caudoventral part of the surangular suggests an increase in adductor mass resulting in a greater bite force. Bite marks in a large chelid plastron, attributable to K. taraina, support this inference. K. taraina is further distinguished from other Kambara species by the possession of a fully interlocking dentition and a decreased number of alveoli.  Analysis of the postcranial anatomy suggests an overall generalist crocodilian body plan. However, aspects of the tarsal elements suggest that K. taraina may have been more adept at either terrestrial or shallow water &#8216;bottom-walking&#8217; locomotion than other generalist aquatic crocodilians. Due to the completeness and size of the sample, description of the Kerosene Creek Member postcranial elements provides a standard reference text for mekosuchine postcranial anatomy, setting a precedent for consideration of postcranial anatomy in a field where little previous work has been done. Functional morphologic analyses of both the cranium and postcranium of K. taraina along with its palaeoenvironmental context suggest that this crocodile fed foraged along the shallow lake margins, operating as an opportunistic ambush predator.  Macroscopic and radiographic analyses have revealed pathologic deformities in some elements demonstrating the presence of infection, neoplasm, and fractures that likely resulted from intraspecific fighting in K. taraina. A severely deformed left humerus has been shown to have suffered chronic osteomyelitis, a condition that, although well-documented in the fossil record, has not been previously reported for Australasian fossil crocodiles. A left fibula possesses evidence of neoplastic growth, tentatively attributed to a vascular tumour. The legion is expansile, exhibiting cortical thinning and formed coarse trabeculae in the medullary cavity. This is the first report of neoplasm in a fossil crocodilian from the southern hemisphere, and the first report of a bony vascular tumour in a crocodile.  Thorough description of nearly all osteological elements has allowed a comprehensive scoring of K. taraina for cladistic analysis. Preliminary analyses supported the allocation of Mekosuchinae to within Crocodylidae. However, resolution was insufficient to determine taxon relationships within Mekosuchinae and requires a far more thorough analysis. This preliminary analysis demonstrates the inadequacy of current mekosuchine phylogenetics and the necessity for greater attention to be given to the lack of transparency in published cladistic analyses.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rundle Formation</field><field name="subject">Kambara taraina</field><field name="subject">Mekosuchinae</field><field name="subject">Crocodylia</field><field name="subject">Palaeopathology</field><field name="subject">Palaeobiology</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/75062</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterisation of P450 gene(s) in barley (Hordeum vulgare)</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Linh</field><field name="description">In plants, P450 enzymes encoded by P450 genes play a central role in numerous biosynthetic pathways, such as the production of secondary metabolites, stress responses and disease resistance. This thesis reports upon the utilization of molecular biology techniques to study P450 gene(s) in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.).Using several combinations of degenerate primers, a large number of barley P450 gene fragments were cloned and sequenced from two commercial varieties, Chebec and Harrington. Among 247 isolated sequences, twenty six percent were homologous to genes of known function. The abundance of these sequences differed between the two cultivars. Variations in the motif sequences of the cloned genes were also found between these two cultivars. In addition to the cloned fragments, twenty-two putative barley P450 encoding genes were identified from 24,000 cereal sequences in the International Triticeae EST Cooperative (ITEC) database by homology search. Among these Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) sequences, a full-length P450 sequence was selected for further investigation in this study.This novel P450 gene, CYP72A39, was expressed at a very early vegetative stage, but no expression was detected at the reproductive stage. Comparison of expression profiles of this gene and "digital expression" databases confirmed that this gene was homologous to several cereal EST clones with tissue-specific transcripts responding to various environmental stimuli, such as stresses and disease. Among these, many transcripts in barley were obtained from stressed tissues at the vegetative stage, and two transcripts in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were expressed after being challenged by barley powdery mildew pathogen (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei L.). This suggested that CYP72A39 may play a defence role in the barley seedling.The secondary structure of CYP72A39 was investigated in a comparative analysis using a computational approach. However, attempts to express CYP72A39 in a heterologous system and functional assays of the native protein in barley did not give decisive results, due to the disordered structure of the native protein and limitations of the current method. Screening the 3' UnTranslated Region (3'UTR) of this gene in 158 genotypes of domesticated, landrace and wild barley revealed two haplotypes, which differed by a 12 base indel positioned between two transversions. The presence of both haplotypes in wild and cultivated barley suggests this polymorphism predates the domestication of barley. This indel was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 6H, less than 10 centi-Morgans (cM) from the gene encoding resistance to powdery mildew in barley (B. graminis). A comparison between haplotype diversity and powdery mildew resistance data for over 102 genotypes showed a weak link between the 'long' haplotype and resistance, while the 'short' haplotype was associated with susceptibility. There was no evidence for a strong correlation between haplotype and quality type (malt or feed); however, more malting varieties had the long haplotype, suggesting a possible association with some attributes in modern malting barley. There was no evidence for association with other characteristics such as geographic origin, growth habit or row number. Phylogenetic relationship of the CYP72A39 to other CYP72 members was also investigated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">P450</field><field name="subject">barley</field><field name="subject">Hordeum vulgare</field><field name="subject">isolation</field><field name="subject">characterisation</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/93</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of participants at special interest events in regional Australia</field><field name="creator">Mackellar, Joanne</field><field name="description">Events provide opportunities for communities to socialise, interact and to enjoy a sense of mutual celebration. However, special interest events offer other opportunities for recreation, and for the development of skills, identities and knowledge. Events such as car shows, Sci-fi conventions and Elvis festivals have large numbers of participants, as well as spectators, who have specialised needs and characteristics. This thesis uses a series of five published studies to examine the participants at special interest events and further to understand their characteristics and behaviours. The studies employ a mixed method approach to explore participants at a total of eleven events in Australia. In the first of these studies a spectrum of events is developed to explain the diversity of events in a region, as related to the special interest of participants. The study used a mixed method methodology to examine the differences between audiences at nine events in the Tweed Valley of NSW. The results were used to focus the study more on events that target serious participants.The second study was published as a conceptual paper, providing a comprehensive theoretical framework for the study of serious participants of leisure, recreation and events. The paper posits a model of serious participants (SerPa) for use and refinement in subsequent studies. Papers 3 and 4 explore serious participants at two feature events in Australia, the Wintersun Festival in Coolangatta, and the Elvis Revival Festival in Parkes. Drawing on the serious leisure framework proposed by Stebbins (2001), and other leisure and tourism research, the study explored the characteristics and behaviours of serious participants at these events. Ethnographic methods were used to gain insight into behaviours, through participant observation at the events. The findings further develop the SerPa model, but also identify other themes that are relevant to leisure and event management and marketing. Paper 5 explores the social connections of serious participants made on the Internet, and identifies their relationship to travel planning and events. The study utilised ethnographic methods adapted to the Internet, to identify and discuss the social characteristics of serious participants as fans of Lord of the Rings, and the processes used to collaborate toward travel planning.The study demonstrates the significance of serious participants as a segment of audiences at events, highlighting their contributions to the events themselves. As participants, they make the event happen, and are perhaps more important than consumers (Getz, 2007). They are defined by what they do in their leisure time, more than who they were born as, or by their profession. They have a leisure identity that defines them, and can find support and security in the fanatical system that they subscribe to. This system is usually found in special interest clubs, on-line networks and at events. These social systems help sustain their beliefs, and provide a leisure world where they feel a sense of &#8216;we&#8217;. From their serious devotion and social connectivity, serious participants receive social and personal rewards, which in turn provide more stimuli to develop their skills and/or knowledge. These psycho/social characteristics result in participants searching for new challenges and new destinations, which can facilitate their needs. These are found at events that are designed specifically with serious participants in mind. The study demonstrates that identification of these market segments has important implications for the design and sustainability of events in Australia, and overseas. Additionally, it also has implications for planners and practitioners in leisure and tourism in understanding the extant links between recreation, travel and events.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">event</field><field name="subject">participant</field><field name="subject">special interest</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">festival</field><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/94</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Stand up and give 'em the fright of their life' : a study of intellectual disability and the emergence and practice of self-advocacy</field><field name="creator">Dowse, Leanne Margaret, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Modernising discourses of intellectual disability have brought innovative social technologies that promote participation and freedom for people so labelled. This thesis argues there is a key experiential contradiction between these discourses as operationalised in neo-liberalism and the ways that people with intellectual disability embrace self-advocacy and become political actors in their own right. Through its inherently moral claims, self-advocacy supports the experiential voice of the 'other' and reveals itself as a sustaining and enduring pillar in the struggle against human injustice and inequity. These other discourses, in contrast, intensify individualisation, ignore power relations and depoliticise self-advocacy as a politics of resistance.  The first part of the thesis critically examines the emergence of intellectual disability as a dimension of human difference and examines how forms of knowledge shape social and policy responses to such people. The second part presents a collaborative action research methodology and a reflective study which challenges the bio-medical, positivist and psycho-reductionist styles of research that have objectified people with intellectual disability. Using this methodology, the voices and experiences of two groups of self-advocates, one in England and the other in Australia are interpreted.  Contemporary professional and other governmental interventions demand individual competencies in the pursuit of self-determination. These discourses of empowerment and citizenship are in constant tension with historically conditioned structures which shape the material and social lives of people with intellectual disability. The thesis finds similarities in the ways that self-advocates and their allies interpret these political realities and work within, across and beyond their contradictory trajectories of constraint and freedom.  The study suggests that self-advocacy is a complex and sophisticated practice aimed at recognition of the unique lived experience of intellectual disability and the legitimacy of claims to self-representation. It also operates at a deeper level as an emotional process of transformation.

The examples of such applications are the starter alternator system of automobiles proposed for the 42V PowerNet, traction in the hybrid/electric vehicle, wind power generator etc. The Permanent Magnet (PM) machine is the natural choice of such niche applications because of their higher efficiency and compact size. However, the Surface Permanent Magnet (SPM) machine with sine distributed winding and radially-laminated Interior Permanent Magnet (IPM) machine with conventional structure has very limited or zero flux-weakening capability. The flux-weakening capability of the SPM machine can be improved by using concentrated, fractional-slot stator but here well-known advantages of the sine distributed winding are needed to be compromised. In the IPM machine, fluxweakening was improved using axial lamination and more than two magnet layers per pole. However, the construction of such IPM machine is complicated and expensive. This thesis presents design and analysis of a new type of the Interior Permanent Magnet (IPM) machine that have a very wide Constant Power Speed Range (CPSR) without compromising simplicity of construction and advantages of the distribution winding. In the new IPM machine, the magnet poles were segmented in the radially direction and the iron bridges between magnet segments provide for additional paths of flux-canalization to give the rotor an inherent capability of fluxweakening. Consequently, a very wide constant power speed range can be achieved in such machines. The proposed IPM machine of this work was referred as the Segmented IPM machine. The thesis focuses on the optimization of the Segmented IPM machine in a 42V environment of the automobile. First, for the conceptual evaluation a 4 pole, 550W Segmented Magnet IPM machine was optimized using finite element analysis. The parameters were calculated for prediction of the steady-state and transient performances. The torque- and power-speed capability were estimated using time-step, circuit-coupled finite element analysis. The cogging torque and variation of iron loss with frequency were also investigated during the design process. A prototype machine was constructed on the basis of the optimized design. The steady-state and transient performances of the prototype machine were measured and compared with the predicted results for experimental verification. The measured performance analysis was found to match very well with the predicted results. The measured torque- and power-speed capability of the Segmented IPM machine was also compared to those of a conventional, non-segmented IPM machine of similar rating and size. The thesis also presents the optimized design of a 6kW, 12 pole Segmented Magnet IPM machine for application in the Integrated Starter Alternator (ISA) of the electric/hybrid vehicle. It can be concluded from the predicted steady-state analysis of the 6 kW, 12 pole Segmented Magnet IPM machine that it should be able to satisfy most of the required criteria of an ISA with appropriate design optimization.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Permanent magnet motors -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Electric motors, Synchronous.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40878</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical study on the impact of organisational culture and GSS on group decision outcomes</field><field name="creator">Huang, Hai-Shen, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study examines the impact of organisational culture and GSS (Group Support Systems) on small group decision-making as measured by group decision outcomes. Laboratory experiments were designed to investigate how two types of groups selected on the basis of having apparently different organisational cultures make decisions on a preference task, in situations where they were given one of two different means of support (face-to-face GSS support or manually structured support) to aid their decision-making. Organisational culture and GSS are the independent variables, whilst the dependent outcome variables were perceived decision quality, decision process satisfaction, decision satisfaction, unified commitment, collaborative climate, and group cohesiveness. The research results showed that manually-supported groups, those who were given simple physical decision-support aids and worked face-to-face, had higher perceived decision quality and decision process satisfaction but no significant differences in unified commitment, decision satisfaction, collaborative climate, and group cohesiveness were found when compared to face-to-face GSS???supported groups who were given electronic aids. One of the two groups drawn from environments where organisational culture was expected to be quite different, that is the Kensington Campus group had higher perceived decision quality, decision process satisfaction, unified commitment, and group cohesiveness but no significant differences in decision satisfaction and collaborative climate when compared with groups drawn from a campus of the same university, ADFA (Australian Defence Force Academy) Campus, one which is attended only by military students. Whilst compared with those of manually structured support on group outcomes, the impacts of GSS on group outcomes weakened when they performed a preference task, organisational culture was found to have a significant impact on group outcomes when both face-to-face GSS and manual settings were considered.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Group support systems</field><field name="subject">organisational culture</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="subject">group decision making</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development and evaluation of a school-based prevention program for alcohol and cannabis use delivered via the internet</field><field name="creator">Newton, Nicola Clare Alice, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Alcohol and cannabis are the two most commonly used licit and illicit drugs in most developing countries including Australia. The burden of disease, social costs and harms associated with the use of these drugs is considerable. As such, the need for prevention is clear. Although an array of school-based drug prevention programs exist, the majority of these show minimal effects in reducing actual drug use. The most common impediments to their success concern obstacles to implementation and dissemination of programs, and a lack of sequential and developmentally appropriate messages.  The aim of this thesis was to address these limitations by developing and evaluating an integrated school-based prevention program to reduce alcohol and cannabis use. The innovative program known as the Climate Schools: Alcohol and Cannabis Course is founded on current evidence-based research, adopts a harm-minimisation approach to drug prevention and is embedded within the school health curriculum. The core content of the program is delivered over the internet using novel cartoon storylines to engage students.  The early development of the course consisted of a cross-validation trial to test the feasibility and generalisability of an existing Climate Schools program for alcohol prevention. Extensive collaboration with teachers, students and health professionals was later conducted to extend and modify the Climate Schools framework to include the prevention of cannabis use. To date, this is the first time an internet-based harm-minimisation cannabis prevention program has been developed for use in schools.  To establish the efficacy of the comprehensive Climate Schools: Alcohol and Cannabis Course, a cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted with 10 schools in Sydney (n = 764). Results from this trial demonstrated the innovative course to be effective in increasing knowledge regarding alcohol and cannabis use, and in decreasing the use of these drugs six months following the intervention. This novel approach was found to be acceptable to students and teachers as a means of delivering drug education in schools. This thesis provides support for the more widespread dissemination of the Climate Schools model in schools. The barriers to dissemination require further research and are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alcohol</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="subject">Cannabis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representing the human body ??? science as social meaning</field><field name="creator">Daly, Tricia, School of Media, Film &amp; Theatre, UNSW</field><field name="description">Representing the human body ??? science as social meaning adopts and develops systemic functional social semiotics to analyse the popular science texts, The Human Body, Superhuman, Human Instinct, Brain Story, The Secret Life of Twins and How to Build a Human. These are predominantly produced through the resources of the Wellcome Trust and/or the BBC/TLC (The Learning Channel), and feature celebrity doctors (Robert Winston) or scientists (Susan Greenfield) as presenters. Adopting a modified and expanded systemic functional semiotics derived from Kress and van Leeuwen (1996, 2001), it is argued that these texts share a logic that displaces social/historical time (including broader historical and social struggles) by constructing the apparent timelessness of middle-class families, by metaphor and abstraction. Central to the temporalities of these programmes is the notion of ???going back??? to the familial in which conscious (patriarchal) time is seen as ???male??? and the unconscious timeless is seen as ???female???. Second, the penetrative digital modes of the programmes imagine different, if conventional, genders, emphasising the interior and inertial female. The popular medical science discourses highlighted in the analysis constitute an unconscious set of taken-for-granted socio-political contexts in which medical and bioscientific knowledge is paraded and celebrated. Narrative resolution of the contradictions inherent in the contextual refrain of contemporary global capitalism is largely achieved through time by the semiotic realisation of ???going back??? to evolutionary, genetic, and (hence to) essential time and to abstracted spatial metaphors. The production origins (British, multi-national) of the factual science documentary prefigure or pre-structure the genre???s conservative colonising discourse around gender, ???race??? and evolution that are developed as social, political or even military metaphors.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">semiotics</field><field name="subject">medical illustration</field><field name="subject">scientific illustration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Student perceptions of effective schooling</field><field name="creator">Nockles, David Peter</field><field name="description">Doctor of Education (EdD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">effective schools</field><field name="subject">effective schooling</field><field name="subject">school improvement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technical and further education (TAFE) managers : balancing managerial and and professional outcomes in their role as educational leaders</field><field name="creator">Rice, Ann</field><field name="description">The research in this portfolio is situated in Technical and Further Education (TAFE) in New South Wales.

These managers are suffering a number of tensions associated with balancing the pedagogic, professional and managerial aspects of their role. While recommendations were made about how to improve the managers&#8217; role, a concern remains that performance indicators in TAFE which emphasise quantitative measures of efficiency, marginalise educational quality. Many staff now view the managers&#8217; role as unattractive, raising questions about who will step up to sustain valued leadership in TAFE.

The purpose of this sociological study was to discover and illuminate the lived experience of using CAM by individuals living with chronic illnesses in an attempt to understand their reasons for choosing CAM for their health care needs within the social contexts of their lives. The research question guiding this qualitative study was: Based upon a reflection of lived experiences, why do individuals living with chronic illnesses choose to use CAM? The major finding of this study was that research participants turned to CAM to find practical solutions for coping with pain and the ongoing demands of living daily lives while suffering and living with chronic illnesses. Unlike existing research findings, participants in this study did not turn to CAM for ideological reasons, nor were they seeking a holistic approach to health and health care. As such, the findings of this study strongly suggest that individuals living with chronic illnesses initially choose to use CAM for pragmatic reasons rather than ideological dispositions. However, the findings also suggest that after their initial use of CAM, individuals appear to adopt, via enculturation processes, more holistic ideologies resulting in modifications to perceptions of self, illness and health.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chronic diseases</field><field name="subject">alternative treatment</field><field name="subject">chronically ill</field><field name="subject">alternative medicine</field><field name="subject">self-care, health</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/39660</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DETECTION AND EXPRESSION OF BIOSYNTHETIC GENES IN ACTINOBACTERIA</field><field name="creator">BERVANAKIS, GEORGE</field><field name="description">Most microbial organic molecules are secondary metabolites which consist of diverse chemical structures and a range of biological activities. Actinobacteria form a large group of Eubacteria that are prolific producers of these metabolites. The recurrence of pathogens resistant to antibiotics and a wider use of these metabolites apart from their use as anti-infectives, has been the impetus for pharmaceutical companies to search for compounds produced by rare and existing actinobacterial cultures.

Accessing microbial biosynthetic pathway diversity has been possible through the use of sensitive and innovative molecular detection methodologies. The present study evaluated the use of molecular based screening as a rational approach to detect secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes (SMBG) in uncharacterised natural Actinobacterial populations. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach was selected for ease of application and high sample processivity. Rational designed screening approaches using PCR in the discovery of SMBG, involved identifying common functions in secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways, such as condensation reactions in polyketide synthesis, genes encoding these functions, and using conserved regions of these genes as templates for the design of primers to detect similar sequences in uncharacterised actinobacteria. Design of primers involved rigorous in silico analysis followed by experimentation and validation. 

PCR screening was applied to 22 uncharacterised environmental isolates, eight of these displayed the presence of the ketosynthase (KS) gene belonging to the type I polyketide synthases and eight contained the ketosynthase (KS&#131;&#209;) gene belonging to the type II polyketide synthases, six of the isolates contained the presence of a presumptive dTDP-glucose synthase (strD) gene which is involved in the formation of deoxysugar components of aminoglycoside antibiotics and one isolate contained the presence of a presumptive isopenicillin N synthase (pcbC) gene involved in beta-lactam synthesis. Alignments of partially sequenced PCR products from isolates A1488 and A3023 obtained using type II PKS primers showed close similarities with KS&#131;&#209; genes from antibiotic producing actinobacteria. Similarly, alignments of sequences from isolates A1113 and A0350 showed regions of similarities to KS genes from antibiotic producing actinobacteria.

Fermentation techniques were used for inducing expression of secondary metabolites from the uncharacterised actinobacteria isolates. By using antimicrobial guided screening it was determined that most of the isolates possessed the capacity to produce antimicrobial metabolites. Dominant antagonistic activity was detected against Gram positive bacteria and to a minor extent against fungi. Optimal fermentation liquid media were identified for certain isolates for the production of antimicrobial metabolites. Two alternative fermentation methods; solid-state and liquid-oil fermentations were evaluated to improve secondary metabolite production in the uncharacterised isolates. Solid-substrate fermentation showed that it could induce a complex metabolite pattern by TLC analysis, however this pattern varied according to the substrate being used. Liquid media supplemented with refined oils, showed a positive response indicated by higher antibacterial activities detected.

Evaluation of semi-purified organic extracts identified two isolates A1113 and A0350 producing similar antimicrobial metabolites as detected by HPLC/UV/MS, a literature database search of similar compounds containing the same molecular weight identified the compound as belonging to the actinomycin group of compounds. A complex metabolic pattern was identified for isolate A2381, database searching identified some of the compounds as having similar molecular weights to  actinopyrones, trichostatins, antibiotics PI 220, WP 3688-5 and YL 01869P.

Drug discovery screening can serve to benefit from PCR detection of biochemical genotypes in initial screens, providing a rapid approach in identifying secondary metabolite producing capabilities of microorganisms prior to the commencement of costly and time consuming fermentation studies. Additionally the identification of biochemical genotypes allows a directed approach in using fermentation media designed to induce biosynthetic pathways of  specific classes of compounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">actinobacteria</field><field name="subject">PCR screening</field><field name="subject">secondary metabolites</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090531.033038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In memory of cats : the camera and the ordinary moment : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Korver, Ruth M.</field><field name="description">In memory of cats: The camera and the ordinary moment looks at the way in which families use photographs to remember the past. Photography&#8217;s offer of memory is limited to a visual trace, so strategies of oral telling are examined to interrogate the way in which memories can be recovered from photographs. Martha Langford&#8217;s study of the similarities between structures in oral culture and the photograph album and Annette Kuhn&#8217;s strategies for reading family photographs in a broader historical context, are used to examine and recover memories from my own photographic archive. Using moving image to record those memories and then tell how that photographic evidence has shaped my present, is a process suggested by Linda Williams in her writing about how postmodern documentary can use the past to intervene in the present. Other documentary styles, performative documentary and the essay film, offer a structure for personal memories to be revisited and re-presented to public viewers. Offering a space for personal or specific memories to be understood or related to by a viewer is discussed by Lisa Saltzman, who looks at indexical forms other than the photograph, like casting and tracing. These ideas culminated in my video work, A Clowder of Cats, which explores the losses that have been a part of my history, through photographs of the cats my family has owned. The camera gives us a strategy to remember moments that may otherwise have been forgotten, and moving image provides a space for those ordinary moments to be bought back to the present.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personal memories</field><field name="subject">photographs of cats</field><field name="subject">video images</field><field name="subject">friends and family</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies::410203 Photography studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/956</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being storied; a lived experience in time : an exegesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Day, Catherine</field><field name="description">Being storied; a lived experience of time discusses selected aspects of the research and studio practice undertaken in the course of the year 2008.

The Southern Hemisphere has an intriguing and complicated geological history that provides an ideal backdrop to study these processes. This thesis focuses on three historical events that illustrate these processes: the proposed marine inundation of New Zealand in the Oligocene, the asteroid impact at the K &#8211; Pg boundary, and the continental breakup of Gondwana. It investigates what impact these events had on species diversification by studying the phylogenetic relationships of two groups of taxa &#8211; the family Anostostomatidae (insects), and Neoaves (birds). Anostostomatidae were studied in relation to the Oligocene drowning and the break up of Gondwana as they have a wide southern distribution, found on all &#8220;Gondwanan&#8221; fragments with the exception of Antarctica, and are thought represent an ancient lineage that predates the Gondwanan breakup. Birds, in particular Neoaves, were studied in relation to the asteroid impact at the K &#8211; Pg boundary. Although birds are mobile and many circumnavigate the globe between seasons, they are suggested to have originated in the Southern Hemisphere in Gondwanan times, and subsequently undergone range expansion and diversification around the world. In order to address the relationship (if any) between modern biotic diversity and historical geological events, phylogenetic relationships were determined and where possible, molecular clock analysis carried out. Timing information provided by molecular clock analysis is important as it enables distinction between opposing hypotheses such as vicariance and dispersal. In Chapter Two, the phylogenetic relationships within the family Anostostomatidae are investigated. One of the most controversial times in New Zealand&#8217;s geological history is during the Oligocene. Some suggest that the lack of fossils and evidence for recent dispersal of numerous taxa support the notion that all modern biota reached the region during the last 25 million years. Anostostomatidae were chosen as they represent a group of insects that are thought to be ancient and there is little published data in the literature. Previous studies focused on the relationships within Hemideina and Deinacrida suggesting that these groups diversified in the early Miocene. The data presented here are from mitochondrial (COI and 12S) and nuclear (18S and 28S) sequences. Molecular dating using a relaxed clock as implemented in BEAST suggest that in fact some lineages were present at or shortly after continental breakup and could have survived throughout this turbulent time. As there were no definitive fossils to use for calibration points, geological events were used as calibration points for the molecular clock. Mutation rates obtained from the different analyses were compared to those published for other insects in an attempt to identify the most likely model. Both maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses support the presence of three distinct ecological groups in New Zealand; Hemiandrus (ground weta), Anisoura/Motuweta (tusked weta) and Hemideina&#8211;Deinacrida (tree&#8211;giant weta). With regards to their Australasian relatives (taxa from Australia and New Caledonia) it appears that the family is divided with the most northern New Zealand taxa (tusked weta) more closely related to New Caledonian taxa while all other New Zealand taxa are more closely related to Australian taxa. There does not appear to be any link between the Australian and New Caledonian taxa studied here. Results should be viewed with caution however as an increased mutation rate was observed in the New Caledonian-tusked weta lineage, something future studies will have to address. Chapter Three presents new sequence data and phylogenetic analyses that go towards resolving the apparent basal polytomy of neoavian birds. This chapter includes analyses carried out on previously published data with the addition of nine new mitochondrial genomes. My contribution to this larger project was to perform the phylogenetic analysis and to sequence three of the nine mitochondrial genomes. The genomes I sequenced were the Southern Hemisphere species: dollar bird (Eurystomus orientalis), Owlet nightjar (Aegotheles cristatus cristatus) and great potoo (Nyctibius grandis). The inclusion of these nine new genomes allows assessment and comparison of the six hypothesised groups reported in Cracraft (2001). First an improved conditional down-weighting technique is described reducing noise relative to signal, which is important for resolving deeper divergences. Second, a formula is presented for calculating probabilities of finding predefined groupings in the optimal tree. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian based phylogenetic analyses were carried out and in addition, dating using a relaxed molecular clock was performed in BEAST. Results suggested that the six groups suggested by Cracraft (2001) represent robust lineages. The results suggested that one group, the owls, are more closely related to other raptors, particularly accipitrids (buzzards/eagles) and the osprey rather than the Caprimulgiformes, which could indicate morphological convergent evolution. In addition, a group termed shorebirds appears to be distinct from the large group referred to as &#8216;Conglomerati&#8217; to which previous publications have suggested they belong. The &#8216;Conglomerati&#8217; is the least well studied group and may actually comprise of at least three subgroups (as suggested by Cracraft). Within the three suggested groups, Cracraft grouped shorebirds with pigeons and sandgrouse, neither of which (pigeons or sandgrouse) were analysed here. So although the shorebirds are at least close to the &#8216;Conglomerati&#8217; and may be within that group, their exact position is still not clear. The molecular dating reported here utilised two fossil calibrations (Vegavis and Waimanu), for which there is relatively little dispute as to age or the lineage to which they belong. Calibrations resulting from BEAST analyses suggest that at least 12 distinct lineages were present prior to the K &#8211; Pg boundary, a finding supported by previous studies. Robust phylogenies will allow future studies to investigate not only the relationships within Neoaves, but look more closely at the biological and ecological evolution of the group. Chapter Four for the first time investigates whether the phylogenetic relationships within the family Anostostomatidae follow the conventionally accepted order and timing of Gondwanan breakup. Following the initial restults for taxa studied in Australasia (Chapter Two) an attempt to resolve family relationships in a wider spatial (geographic) context was carried out to determine if Australasian taxa are monophyletic when other members of the family are included. Again both maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were carried out on both mitochondrial (COI and 12S) and nuclear (18S and 28S) sequences. In this chapter, datasets included samples from across the geographic range of Anostostomatidae (South Africa, Madagascar, South America, Australia, New Caledonia and New Zealand), and two clades were observed, congruent with earlier findings. Sequence divergence within geographic regions was found to be relatively high in the mitochondrial genes (COI and 12S) while low in the nuclear ribosomal RNA genes (18S and 28S) as expected given their relative mutation rates. Under the vicariance paradigm, phylogenetic relationships should follow the order of continental breakup, but this was not found. Further, if dispersal and colonisation were continuous, no geographic substructure is expected, however distinct geographic substructure within clades was consistently observed. This interesting phylogenetic pattern may be a case of convergent evolution or paraphyletic sampling which highlights taxonomic issues of the group. Future studies need to include not only molecular data but information on morphology, ecology and behaviour along with the implementation of biogeographic programs that can test alternative hypotheses (such as dispersal and vicariance) directly. Also, the inclusion of the recently reported fossil from the subfamily Euclydesinae (Martins-Neto 2007) should allow for more accurate date estimates within the family. Taken as a whole the results presented in this thesis suggest that microevolutionary processes are sufficient to explain modern diversity without the need to invoke abiotic events. The three cases investigated here - marine inundation, asteroid impact and continental drift - all appear to have had only a limited effect on the diversity of taxa studied. To reach even stronger conclusions future studies should incorporate different data (for instance nuclear genes, intron position, and genome structure) and use biogeographic software capable of including ecological, morphological and habitat information.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anostostomatidae</field><field name="subject">neoaves</field><field name="subject">geological events</field><field name="subject">phylogenetic relationships</field><field name="subject">Oligocene</field><field name="subject">early Miocene</field><field name="subject">Gondwana</field><field name="subject">biogeography</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270208 Molecular evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being Anglo-Indian : practices and stories from Calcutta : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Social Anthropology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Andrews, Robyn</field><field name="description">This thesis is an ethnography of Anglo-Indians in Calcutta.

I begin by outlining briefly who Anglo-Indians are, a topic which in itself alerts one to complexities of trying to get an ethnographic grip on a shifting subject. I then look at some crucial elements that are necessary for an &#8220;understanding&#8221; of Anglo-Indians in Calcutta: the work that has already been done in relation to Anglo-Indians, the urban context of the lives of my research participants and I discuss the methodological issues that I had to deal with in constructing this account. In the second part of my thesis I explore some crucial elements of the lives of Anglo-Indians in Calcutta: the place of Christianity in their lives, education not just as an aspect of socialisation but as part of their very being and, finally, the public rituals that now give them another way of giving expression to new forms of Anglo-Indian becoming. In all of my work I was driven by a desire to keep close to the experience of the people themselves and I have tried to write a &#8220;peopled&#8221; ethnography.

If X is a reflexive space, both type of Extensions are assured; in fact if X contains an isomorphic copy of co, then every Operator T ?? L(X) that has a continuous functional calculus necessarily admits a Borel one. We show that if a space X has a predual, then also every operator T ?? L(X) with a continuous functional calculus admits a bounded Borel functional Calculus.  In case a Banach space X either contains an isomorphic copy of co, or has a Predual, and T ?? L(X) is an operator with an AC functional calculus, we find that the existence of a decomposition of the identity of bounded variation for T is sufficient to ensure that the AC functional calculus may be extended to a BV functional calculus.  We also consider operators defined by a linear map on interpolation families of Banach spaces [Xr, X???] (r???1), where for example Xp = lp, Lp[0,1] or Cp. We show that under certain uniform boundedness conditions, the possession of a BV functional calculus by operators on the spaces Xp, p ?? (r, ???), may be extrapolated to the corresponding operators on the spaces Xr and X???.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Banach spaces</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhanced biocatalyst production for (R)-phenylacetylcarbinol synthesis</field><field name="creator">Chen, Allen Kuan-Liang, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The enzymatic production of R-phenylacetylcarbinol (R-PAC), with either whole cells or partially purified pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) as the biocatalyst, requires high PDC activity and an inexpensive source of pyruvate for an economical feasible biotransformation process. Microbial pyruvate produced by a vitamin auxotrophic strain of Candida glabrata was selected as a potential substrate for biotransformation. With an optimal thiamine concentration of 60 ??g/l, a pyruvic acid concentration of 43 g/l and yield of 0.42 g/g glucose consumed were obtained. Using microbially-produced unpurified pyruvate resulted in similar PAC concentrations to those with commercial pure substrate confirming its potential for enzymatic PAC production. To obtain high activity yeast PDC, Candida utilis was cultivated in a controlled bioreactor. Optimal conditions for PDC production were identified as: fermentative cell growth at initial pH at 6.0 followed by pH downshift to 3.0. Average specific PDC carboligase activity of 392 ?? 20 U/g DCW was achieved representing a 2.7-fold increase when compared to a constant pH process. A mechanism was proposed in which the cells adapted to the pH decrease by increasing PDC activity to convert the accumulated internal pyruvic acid via acetaldehyde to ethanol thereby reducing intracellular acidification. The effect of pH shift on specific PDC activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae achieved a comparable increase of specific PDC carboligase activity to 335 U/g DCW. The effect of pyruvic acid at pH 3.0 on induction of PDC activity was confirmed by cultivation at pH 3 with added pyruvic acid. Using microarray techniques, genome-wide transcriptional analyses of the effect of pH shift on S. cerevisiae revealed a transient increased expression of PDC1 after pH shift, which corresponded to the increase in specific PDC activity (although the latter was sustained for a longer period). The results showed significant gene responses to the pH shift with approximately 39 % of the yeast genome involved. The induced transcriptional responses to the pH shift were distinctive and showed only limited resemblance to gene responses reported for other environmental stress conditions, namely increased temperature, oxidative conditions, reduced pH (succinic acid), alkaline pH and increased osmolarity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enzymes -- Biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Ephadrine</field><field name="subject">Pharmaceutical biotechnology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on Genetic Markers and in Particular nm23 in Sporadic Colorectal Cancer: Predictors of Liver Metastasis</field><field name="creator">Berney, Christophe Roger Yves, Surgery, Prince of Wales Hospital, UNSW</field><field name="description">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common malignancy in the developed Western countries and represents the second leading cause of death from cancer after lung cancer. Despite better diagnostic tools and improvement of surgical standards, the prognosis of this disease is still unsatisfactory with a mean 5-year cancer-specific survival of approximately 50%, mainly due to our inability to predict liver failure secondary to hepatic involvement and still poorly effective palliative treatments. The metastatic cascade is a complex, multistep process driven by progressive accumulation of genetic alterations which result in proto-oncogene activation and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes. Among the additional pathways involved in this process, secretion of angiogenesis factors, proteolysis of the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) molecules, and probably inhibition of apoptosis are also known to facilitate tumour progression. We undertook a retrospective study in a series of paraffin-embedded human colonic tissues to investigate the prognostic significance of new tumour markers as predictors of liver metastasis and survival in sporadic CRC. This research was conducted in three parts: first, immunohistochemical studies of protein markers and development of a new quantitative method of measurement in a subset of the immunostained sections using a colour video image analysis (VIA) procedure; second, concomitant determination of the expression of the bcl-2 gene at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level, using a more specific methodology of in situ hybridisation (ISH) and investigation of the relationship between bcl-2 mRNA and its encoded protein expression; and third, investigation of microsatellite alterations at four loci using a fluorescent microsatelllite polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay coupled with an automated DNA sequencer. In our initial immunohistochemical experiment, we found a good correlation between colour VIA and semiquantitative evaluation of nm23 immunoreactivity (IR) confirming the validity of such quantitative analysis (Pearson's correlation coefficient r=0.88; P&lt;0.001). Furthermore, overexpression of nm23 was associated with an increased risk of developing liver metastases (logrank test for trend, P&lt;0.001) and cancer-related death (P=0.002). We used the same quantitative method to determine the expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and c-erbB-2 (HER2/neu) proteins and found that neither predicted patient outcome. However, CRC showing overexpression of u-PA (above 85 pixels) had an increased risk of liver metastasis (P=0.013). Since this was a post hoc analysis we can not be confident that this represents a real effect. There were significant positive correlations among expression of all three markers, u-PA, c-erbB-2 and nm23 proteins (u-PA vs c-erbB-2, Spearman rank correlation coefficient, P=0.003; u-PA vs nm23, P&lt;0.001; c-erbB-2 vs nm23, P=0.001) suggesting that, in vivo, all proteins interact or are similarly regulated. Semiquantitative analysis of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein showed that expression of VEGF was significantly reduced in the metastatic liver tumours compared to their matched primary ones (Wilcoxon test, P=0.002), suggesting VEGF activity to be secondarily down-regulated once the tumour cells reach the hepatic parenchyma. There was no strong evidence from our data that the level of VEGF in the primary tumour could predict risk of liver metastasis or survival duration. Finally, when semiquantitatively assessing five protein markers (nm23, p53, c-erbB- 2, u-PA, and VEGF) individually or in combination, we found that only nm23 protein expression was positively related to the risk of liver metastasis (logrank test, P&lt;0.001); p53 protein expression was only marginally associated (P=0.091). Furthermore, patients with Dukes' stage B tumours showing positive expression of nm23 protein also demonstrated an increased risk of liver metastasis (P=0.001). Although the risk of developing liver secondaries was statistically correlated with the number of positive markers (NPM) and the cumulative intensity score (CIS) (logrank test for trend, P=0.004 and P=0.001 respectively), these two parameters did not improve the predictive value over and above that of nm23 protein alone. These results suggest that the only marker of the five we studied that provides prognostic information about the risk of developing liver metastasis in CRC is nm23. Its evaluation may be particularly useful in selecting high risk Dukes' stage B patients who should be considered for adjuvant chemotherapy. In the second part of this study, immunohistochemical analysis using a monoclonal mouse antibody to the bcl-2 protein and in situ hybridisation using digoxigenin-labelled bcl-2 cRNA probes were carried out on the same paraffin-embedded specimens and semiquantitatively assessed. These specimens also included adenomas with various degrees of dysplasia. The expression of bcl-2 protein was gradually and significantly lost during the progression from moderately dysplastic adenoma to primary CRC [moderate/severe dysplasia: Mann-Whitney U-test, P=0.0001; severe dysplasia/primary CRC: P=0.027], whereas the cellular expression of bcl-2 mRNA was progressively increased during the dysplasia/adenoma-carcinoma neoplastic sequence. Our observation suggests that in a proportion of CRCs the bcl-2 proto-oncogene expression may be down-regulated at a post-transcriptional level. In the final section of this study, we investigated the possible relationship between loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instability (MIN) at four microsatellite loci spanning the 17q21-23 region that includes the nm23-H1 and nm23- H2 genes, to the risk of liver metastasis and nm23 protein expression. Genomic DNA was extracted from the same series of paraffin-embedded colorectal specimens and a fluorescent PCR coupled with DNA fragment analysis in an automated DNA sequencer was applied. In 45% and 48% of the primary and secondary lesions, LOH was present in at least one locus. We found a positive correlation when looking for a trend comparing the fraction of sites with LOH at these loci to risk of liver recurrence (logrank test for trend, P=0.005). This remained an independent predictor after adjusting to T-stage (Multivariate Cox regression, P=0.022), N-stage (P=0.007), or Dukes' stage (P=0.012). MIN was present in 2 loci in 41% and 30% of the primary and secondary tumours respectively. Considering only the Dukes' B tumours, we found that an increasing number of sites showing MIN was associated with a reduced risk of liver recurrence (logrank test for trend, P=0.032). When comparing LOH and MIN status of the primary and matched liver secondary tumours with their corresponding normal tissue samples, we found concordant genomic alterations in 72% (NME1 locus) to 43% (D17S579). Finally, we observed a trend in association between the proportion of loci with LOH and nm23 positivity ( ?? 2 test for trend, P=0.024). These findings suggest that, genomic alterations in the 17q21-23 region may affect prognosis of CRC as well as regulation of the nm23 protein expression via a stillmechanism.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">colon</field><field name="subject">liver</field><field name="subject">rectum</field><field name="subject">metastasis</field><field name="subject">genetic markers</field><field name="subject">nm23</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poor glycaemic control in adolescents with type 1 diabetes</field><field name="creator">Stone, Monique Lee, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Many adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) have suboptimal glycaemic control, increasing the risk of diabetic complications. This thesis explores some of the causes, consequences and therapeutic options for adolescents with T1DM and poor glycaemic control.  Insulin resistance occurs in T1DM and normal puberty and contributes to poor glycaemic control.  The effect of rosiglitazone, an insulin sensitizer, in addition to insulin on the glycaemic control of adolescents with T1DM was tested using a randomized, double blind placebo controlled trial. Treatment with rosiglitazone did not improve HbA1c, however there was a significant reduction in insulin dose and adiponectin, suggesting improved in insulin sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity by euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp varied widely between individuals and there was no consistent pattern with rosiglitazone.  Potential markers of insulin resistance in T1DM were examined. Total and high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin levels were lower in children and adolescents with T1DM than controls. HMW adiponectin was significantly associated with other markers of insulin resistance, such as insulin dose, body mass index standard deviation score (BMI-SDS), age, pubertal stage and duration of diabetes.  There is increasing evidence that insulin resistance may play a role in T1DM complications. The natural history and risk factors for the development of microalbuminuria was described using a retrospective cohort study of 972 children and adolescents.  Most cases of microalbuminuria were transient. Apart from baseline albumin excretion rate, HbA1c and age at diagnosis, other predictors of subsequently developing persistent microalbuminuria included several markers of insulin resistance (higher cholesterol, BMI-SDS, and insulin dose).  In addition to insulin resistance, there are many other factors that contribute to glycaemic control.  The role of the variability in carbohydrate intake was assessed using questionnaires and food diaries. Although carbohydrate consumption varied by approximately 45grams each day, it had no significant correlation with HbA1c. The impact of socioeconomic status, quality of life and health care delivery is discussed by comparing glycaemic control of children with T1DM in three diabetes centres. A model for the factors associated with poor glycaemic control in adolescents with T1DM is proposed, and the challenges of research and clinical practice in this population are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">insulin resistance</field><field name="subject">type 1 diabetes</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">glycaemic control</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanism studies for crossflow microfiltration with pulsatile flow</field><field name="creator">Li, Hong-yu, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The mechanism of how pulsatile flow affects flux behaviour in crossflow micro-filtration was investigated. The effects of pulsatile flow were sub-divided into shear effects and backflushing effects. A servo-valve hydraulic piston pump was applied to generate pulsatile flows in the membrane module with particular waveforms. Four types of fluid pulsation with specific flow-rate and pressure waveforms were produced for experimental tests. Two parameters, /dVcf\dt/ maxand Pmin, were examined independently for their effect during pulsatile flow, which was estimated by comparing the cake resistance during steady flow and pulsatile flow at the same mean crossflow velocity, trans-membrane pressure and membrane resistance.  Filtration tests for all the pulsatile flows with clean water confirmed that pulsatility only affects cake depositions. Without particles, no flux improvement was obtained.  The results for the microfiltration of 0.5g/1 silica suspension showed that for pulsatile flows without backflushing (i.e. no negative transmembrane pressure peak), the fluid pulsation decreased cake resistance when the shear related parameter /dVcf\dt/max exceeded a critical value for each given waveform. When the instantaneous transmembrane pressure reached negative values, i.e. back-flushing occurred, the cake resistance was reduced for all pressure waves tested. Cake resistance was reduced more for more negative P min. With two of the waveforms tested, the cake resistance was almost completely eliminated. In contrast, the shear affected cake resistance reduction differently for each waveform.  Comparing cake reduction results for different pulsatile waveforms, it was found that, for the square wave, the cake resistance reduction was higher for both shear and backflushing effect tests, while for the short spike waveform, the cake resistance reduction was lower.  The flux waveforms were seen to follow the variations in transmembrane pressure. The flux response time was longer than the time required for the pressure changes, but was not dependent on the direction of the pressure change.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Filters and filtration</field><field name="subject">Membrane filters</field><field name="subject">Membrane separation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17858</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trust, commitment, satisfaction and learning in construction project teams</field><field name="creator">Ong, Eric Mei-Siang, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">The main aim of this research is to investigate how elements of the dynamic and temporary team environment of construction project teams influence trust, commitment, satisfaction and learning in the teams. While much can be learnt from the current literature about teams, the theories have mainly derived and focused on teams from permanent environments such as manufacturing, hospitality, health care, education and technology sectors. The uniqueness of construction project teams (for example, temporariness and multi-organisations involvement) creates a team working environment different from common permanent work teams. As such, numerous questions arise when we consider how construction project teams function and how the members are influenced by the temporary and dynamic team environment. For example, how do the project team members establish trust and commitment in the project team environment? How does the interdependency on each other to accomplish their assigned tasks influence individual members?? attitudes and learning in the project teams? The research adopted a cross-sectional mixed method research design employing both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection in Singapore construction industry. The quantitative method involved survey questionnaires collected from 136 construction practitioners from 47 project teams. The qualitative method involved in-depth interviews with 28 construction practitioners. Quantitative statistical analysis was performed on the survey data using Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS) and qualitative thematic analysis was performed on the interview data using computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software - NVivo.  Amongst other things the research findings indicated that individual team members?? perceived task interdependence and reward interdependence are positively related to their trust and commitment in the team. Additionally, their satisfaction in the team played a mediating role between the relationships. With respect to team learning, the research found that team goals, task interdependence and reward interdependence influence team learning, and team learning contributes to the performance of project teams. On a broad view, the circumstances in which how team members?? trust, commitment, satisfaction and team learning are influenced appear to be similar with other work teams. However, in-depth interviews with construction professionals revealed many complex and subtle factors relating specifically to construction project teams, such as, multi-projects and multi-organisations involvement, and degree of familiarity between the members before the team is set up. These factors are central to the team members. In conclusion, this study has brought insights into how temporary construction project team environment influence members?? team attitudes and team learning experience.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Trust</field><field name="subject">Commitment</field><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="subject">Construction Project Teams</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Low life" small objects to sit upon: a studio investigation into a rational use of materials for small scale domestic objects</field><field name="creator">Timar , Szuszy, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The project undertaken was aimed at extending a current craft based jewellery practice. Related by structure and materiality, the research sought to develop exploratory shapes as low seating objects to exist within small scale living spaces and studio apartments. Signaling an increased conscious way of thinking and working, a reflective process examining each form as series, provided an incremental creative strategy. The availability of discarded materials suggested possibilities for a sustainable cost effective option as a mode of contemporary practice. This combined approach was considered impact negative, diffusing global waste, and impact positive providing valid alternatives through functional and aesthetic objects.  At present waste materials exist as products are still designed and made on the basis of planned obsolescence, thus an exploitation and escalation of global resources and resultant hazardous outcomes continues. Citing selected writings by Victor Papanek, (1992), and Edwin Datschefski, (2006) provided an understanding of the misuse high impact advanced technologies imposes on the environment. These notions were discussed during the project and in relation to contemporary models of practice which currently use discarded materials to make objects for living.  Based on a survey observing the local homewares and furniture industries within Sydney, Australia, and recent published material, a niche market was discovered for challenging conventions of low seating objects. Initial sketches were transformed into marquettes then developed into full size prototypes of multi functional forms. a series of forms were scaled up, made of discarded materials using simple hand crafted processes and minimal production methods.  As a reference influences included architects, sculptors and craft practitioners who were examined particularly for their use of discarded materials or for their construction methods. During experimental studies visual source material drew upon an observation and analysis of architecture, skeletal structures and land formations.  In an exhibition originally titled, "Be Seated", these forms made as initial prototypes were exhibited at Kudos Gallery, Sydney, Australia, during May 2007. They were later refined and renamed as "Low Life" for a group exhibition "Contained"  held at Kudos Gallery during 2008.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Design, Industrial -- 21st century .</field><field name="subject">Recycling (Waste, etc.)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanical principles of cavity preparation for posterior cast gold restorations : to be presented as section A - Review of the literature, section B -Original contribution</field><field name="creator">Hyde, P.

It then goes on to suggest that a deeper engagement with the nondualistic doctrines Naess embraced could lift environmental philosophy out of the Cartesian framework in which it appears to be bogged down. Deep Ecology has been accused of being politically ineffective, and letting down the environmental movement, because it remains insufficiently engaged with debates concerning power, class, sex, and other hegemonies that occupy the minds of social ecologists, ecofeminists, and cultural studies theorists. I argue that Deep Ecology is not as ineffective as detractors claim, but that it remains philosophically undeveloped, and has not provided sound foundations for environmental ethics. The qualified nondualism I advance, based on Ved??nta, the work of David Bohm, and (to a lesser extent) Platonic thought, treats cosmos, society and the individual as intelligent creative systems in which the interrelated parts are expressions of a vital generative order to which each is actively related. The Self is a mirror of the cosmos, engaged in the process of becoming a more complete reflection of the totality. In all of this the nature of consciousness as vast creative intelligence is paramount, and freedom dominates the entire process from beginning to end. This thesis offers an opportunity to rethink ideas of value, moral considerability, and the nature of the empirical self, from a nondualistic perspective. It proposes that "intrinsic unity" might replace the community as the foundational moral concept for environmental ethics. In the process, emphasis shifts away from the objective sphere and settles firmly on the thinker and thought. Following Bohm and Krishnamurti, I argue that conditioned thought is the only barrier to (inner) freedom and creativity. Most important, the metaphysics of nondualism privileges processes of universal Self-realisation, and reveals the limitations of the empirical self. Understanding thought as a process then becomes something of a moral imperative.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Deep ecology - Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25147</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What matters inside organizations: a multiple climates approach to understanding business-unit effectiveness</field><field name="creator">MacCormick, Judith S., Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">My aim in this thesis is to improve understanding of the contributions of organizational climate to organizational effectiveness. Climate is defined as the shared perceptions of the work environment (Schneider &amp; Reichers, 1983). First, I developed and empirically validated four targeted climates ??? climates for involvement; mission-alignment; consistency; and adaptability ??? reflecting a broad range of management perspectives. These climates are based on Quinn and Rohrbaugh???s Competing Values Framework (1983a), and extend the work of Patterson et al. (2005). Using secondary data from 2027 business-units from diverse industries, worldwide, these climates were, as expected, inter-related, yet distinct. Second, I explored the relationships between multiple climates and stakeholder outcomes (staff motivation, perceived customer loyalty and perceived business performance) using structural equation modeling and discriminant function analysis. Separate but matched manager and employee samples from 620 business-units were used to assess relationships linking the four climates and three effectiveness outcomes within a single model. The findings indicated that employees??? perceptions of workplace characteristics influence important organizational outcomes. Overall, key findings were: (1) a climate for mission related directly to perceived business performance; (2) climates for consistency and adaptability both related to higher business performance through their positive link with customer loyalty; (3) a climate for involvement also related to business performance, but only when the context was uncertain; (4) while climates for involvement and mission related to staff satisfaction, staff satisfaction did not uniquely predict business performance; (5) the most effective business-units, with high scores on all three outcomes, had a balance of high levels of all four climates. The thesis discusses the implications of these results for both theory and practice, as well as suggestions for future research. In particular, the comprehensiveness and empirical integrity of this multiple-climates model indicates its potential to provide new insights about the relationships between perceived organizational characteristics and outcomes. Furthermore, my research suggests that organizations can foster high levels of all four climates concurrently, and in doing so achieve better outcomes for a diversity of stakeholders. This has implications for change management: specifically that organizations should embed and integrate multiple approaches concurrently rather than move from one to the next.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organizational behavior</field><field name="subject">Corporate culture</field><field name="subject">Organizational effectiveness</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Journey to inner peace installation and sculpture from a buddhist perspective</field><field name="creator">Le Thua, Tien , Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">My Master of Fine Arts research project focuses on installation and sculpture that embodies the themes of Buddhism and War. My artwork examines how the two themes interact and influence each other. Making art, for me, is an intensely personal process of rediscovering myself. The project is an attempt to create a visual conversation between my personal experiences, memories and imagination. In particular, I explore the collective memory of the people of Hue in relation to the immediate past, and the longer historical heritage of the city and the region.  Chapter One provides a background to my personal experiences of growing up in Hue, Vietnam, during a time of war. This is a relevant starting point as these experiences have shaped my life and my art practice. This chapter begins with my childhood and charts my journey into art education. Visual art is the form and methodology by which I can best express my thoughts, dreams, and reflections. Through sculpture I can share my own vision and thoughts with people from different cultural backgrounds, ideally reaching beyond existing socio-cultural boundaries. It is a personal journey that has led me toward the path of re-discovering my inner world and awakening a forward-looking perspective.  Chapter Two explores the influence Buddhist philosophy has on my art practice. This chapter also discusses the work of four contemporary artists who are primarily concerned with themes of Buddhism and war. Through this research I explore how the philosophy of Buddhism gave me a new perspective on how an artist can live completely in the present, while building a bridge between the past and the future through creative practice. Buddhism is a process of everyday transformation; in practice it is an attempt to forge new beginnings in every facet of daily life.  Chapter Three discusses my earlier sculpture and installation artworks. I then examine how this led me to collaborate with other international contemporary artists who share a common aesthetic or theme.  Chapter Four examines my current art practice and discuss how I see it shaping my future art practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Buddhism.</field><field name="subject">Sculpture.</field><field name="subject">Installation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41874</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A glycoproteomic approach to the structural characterization of acidic glycoproteins</field><field name="creator">Estrella, Ruby Poblete, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Glycoproteins, and their subset proteoglycans, are an important group of molecules in joint tissues, providing crucial functions such as cartilage structural integrity and lubrication at cartilage surfaces.   The functionality of these glycoproteins is attributable to their oligosaccharide components, however surprisingly little is known about their fine structural details.   With the use of glycoproteomic methods, this thesis presents the development and incorporation of mass spectrometric, biochemical and immunological methods to elucidate glycoprotein structures in synovial fluids, chondrocytes and synoviocytes in order to provide insight into how their structures may contribute to their functions.  Initially, anion exchange chromatography was used to extract the acidic fraction containing glycoproteins and proteoglycans in arthritic synovial fluid (SF) samples, followed by proteomic analysis to identify the main glycoproteins in 1D-SDS-PAGE gels. To complement these findings, an in-gel enzymatic digest method for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and oligosaccharide analysis was developed for analysis of glycoproteins by graphitised carbon liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Further  characterization of the major glycoprotein, lubricin, was pursued by investigating its interactions with the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) from its cellular sources and characterising the secreted lubricin with Western blot and proteomic analysis.  Finally, the  graphitised carbon LC-MS method was applied to analyse the overall glycosylation profiles of lubricin. The major glycoprotein found in arthritic synovial fluid was lubricin, as identified by peptide LC-MS and Western blot.  Graphitised carbon LC-MS identified the major chondroitin sulfate (CS) repeat region disaccharides and linkage region oligosaccharides of aggrecan with confirmation through tandem mass spectra and Western blots using CS linkage region stub antibodies.  Application of this method to lubricin led to the discovery of O-linked oligosaccharide structures which were previously undescribed for lubricin. A higher proportion of sialylated oligosaccharide structures were detected in the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) samples compared to the osteoarthritic (OA) samples, which signifies a diagnostic difference between these diseases.

The facility includes a system capable of acquiring 3D images made up of 20003 voxels on core plugs up to 6 cm diameter with resolutions down to 2 um. The cores analysed include six cores from a gas reservoir and four cores from an oil reservoir. The cores exhibit a very broad range of pore and grain sizes, porosity, permeability and mineralogy. The petrological data, available only for gas reservoir cores, is compared with the data obtained from the tomographic images. Computational results made directly on the digitized tomographic images are presented for the permeability, formation factor, resistivity index and drainage capillary pressure across a range of . We show that data over a range of porosity can be computed from a single fragment. We compare the computations of petrophysical data on fragments to conventional laboratory measurements on the full plug. Permeability predictions from digital and conventional core analysis are consistent. It is shown that a characteristic length scale can be dened as a quality control parameter for the estimation of permeability. Results for formation factor, drainage capillary pressure and resistivity index are encouraging. The results demonstrate the potential to predict petrophysical properties from core material not suited for laboratory testing (e.g., sidewall or damaged core and drill cuttings) and the feasibility of combining digitized images with numerical calculations to predict properties and derive correlations for specic rock lithologies. The small sample size required for analysis makes it possible to produce multiple measurements on a single plug. This represents a potential multiplier on the quantity of core data allowing meaningful distributions or spreads in petrophysical properties to be estimated. We discuss the current limitations of the methodology and suggest improvements; in particular the need to calibrate the simulated data to parallel laboratory core measurements. We also describe the potential to extend the methodology to a wider range of petrophysical properties. This development could lead to a more systematic study of the assumptions, interpretations and analysis methods commonly applied within industry and lead to better correlations between petrophysical properties and log measurements.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tomography</field><field name="subject">X-rays</field><field name="subject">Gas reservoirs</field><field name="subject">Data processing</field><field name="subject">Oil fields</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20581</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Codex : code X : a palimpsest reading of the book as a material object in a new media age</field><field name="creator">Lee, Penelope, School of Design, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research investigates the effects of new media technologies on the architecture of the book in the context of a New Media Age. The aim of the project was to develop a Conceptual Framework for the design and production of the contemporary book as a material object. The materiality of the contemporary book is examined by revisiting its historical origins in the Middle Ages, to discover the extent in which the ???new??? media technology of mechanical printing determined the design and production of the fifteenth century book. Parallels were then drawn between these effects and those of digital technology on the book in this current New Media Age. The results revealed the book as a palimpsest, where remnants of ???older??? media remain embedded in the design and form of the ???new.??? While fundamentally situated in the field of graphic design, the study also ventures into the disciplines of architecture and the semiotic theories of Umberto Eco and Gunther Kress. The design of the research includes historical and theoretical analysis, case studies of selected contemporary book objects and a series of studio investigations into the space, form, techniques, processes and materials of traditional and contemporary book construction. The theories and design practices of William Morris, implemented in the studio investigations, included researching the origins of book production in the fifteenth century and the traditional hand technologies of papermaking, printmaking and bookbinding. New media investigations included experimental work with laser etching and the embedding of printed, paper pages in porcelain. A synthesis of the theoretical and practical research findings, was then interpreted as semiotic conceptual matrices, from which a Conceptual Framework was constructed. Conclusions drawn from the study reveal the design of the book as a palimpsest of past technologies that remain embedded in the design of the contemporary book. As a material demonstration of the thesis, a series of threedimensional conceptual models were developed as reading sites informing the design of contemporary books as palimpsest readings of the book as a material object for the New Media Age.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Books</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automating the aetiological classification of descriptive injury data</field><field name="creator">Shepherd, Gareth William, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Injury now surpasses disease as the leading global cause of premature death and disability, claiming over 5.8 millions lives each year. However, unlike disease, which has been subjected to a rigorous epidemiologic approach, the field of injury prevention and control has been a relative newcomer to scientific investigation. With the distribution of injury now well described (i.e. ???who???, ???what???, ???where??? and ???when???), the underlying hypothesis is that progress in understanding ???how??? and ???why??? lies in classifying injury occurrences aetiologically. The advancement of a means of classifying injury aetiology has so far been inhibited by two related limitations: 1. Structural limitation: The absence of a cohesive and validated aetiological taxonomy for injury, and; 2. Methodological limitation: The need to manually classify large numbers of injury cases to determine aetiological patterns. This work is directed at overcoming these impediments to injury research. An aetiological taxonomy for injury was developed consistent with epidemiologic principles, along with clear conventions and a defined three-tier hierarchical structure. Validation testing revealed that the taxonomy could be applied with a high degree of accuracy (coder/gold standard agreement was 92.5-95.0%), and with high inter- and intra- coder reliability (93.0-96.3% and 93.5-96.3%). Practical application demonstrated the emergence of strong aetiological patterns which provided insight into causative sequences leading to injury, and led to the identification of effective control measures to reduce injury frequency and severity. However, limitations related to the inefficient and error-prone manual classification process (i.e. average 4.75 minute/case processing time and 5.0-7.5% error rate), revealed the need for an automated approach. To overcome these limitations, a knowledge acquisition (KA) software tool was developed, tested and applied, based on an expertsystems technique known as ripple down rules (RDR). It was found that the KA system was able acquire tacit knowledge from a human expert and apply learned rules to efficiently and accurately classify large numbers of injury cases. Ultimately, coding error rates dropped to 3.1%, which, along with an average 2.50 minute processing time, compared favourably with results from manual classification. As such, the developed taxonomy and KA tool offer significant advantages to injury researchers who have a need to deduce useful patterns from injury data and test hypotheses regarding causation and prevention.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wounds and injuries - Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Diseases - Causes and theories of causation</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology - Statistical methods</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24934</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integration of children with behaviour disorders: a comparative case study analysis in two Australian states</field><field name="creator">Bradshaw, Keith Allan</field><field name="description">This study was conducted in response to the policies for the integration of children with behaviour disorders in Victorian and New South Wales Primary Schools. These two states were selected for this study for three reasons. Firstly, the two states have adopted and are implementing integration policies which are, in many areas, contrasting. Secondly, compared to other Australian states, Victoria and New South Wales have the most children enrolled in their respective school systems and, hence the largest number of children whose schooling is influenced by these policy decisions. Thirdly, the integration policies of both states group children with behaviour disorders under the generic term 'children with disabilities.' The findings of the present study suggest a number of areas that future implementors of integration policies need to consider. Firstly, mandatory special education courses need to be implemented by all teacher training institutions. Secondly, to effectively integrate children with behaviour disorders into the regular classroom an individual, collaboratively designed program needs to be utilized. Collaboration between special setting teachers and regular class teachers would appear to be crucial in program design. Thirdly, teachers stress emerged as an issue which policy designers need to address urgently. Fourthly, resources and support, including the availability of in-service courses on children with behaviour disorders, need to be increased and made available to regular classroom teachers. Finally a range of alternate educational programs/opportunities, not just a choice between regular and special settings, needs to be developed for children with behavoiur disorders. The study is important to the field of special education and in particular to children with behaviour disorders in three ways. Firstly, data were gathered using both qualitative and quantitative research methods. This approach would appear to be the most appropriate method for gathering data on integration as it allows for many of the child's ecosystems to be investigated and for the child's numerous and important interactions to be examined. Secondly, the study highlighted the importance of investigating the individual needs of children with behaviour disorder when considering integration, Finally, the study allowed for a number of variables, important for practitioners when integrating children with behaviour disorders, to be identified and examined.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disabilities,</field><field name="subject">disorders</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="subject">qualitative</field><field name="subject">special education</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">primary school</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">quantitative</field><field name="subject">integration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/39584</field><field name="identifier">http://heston.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/41</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand businesses in India: opportunities and challenges</field><field name="creator">Nagar, Swati</field><field name="description">As a resource based economy international engagement plays a critical role for the growth and development of New Zealand. One of the most notable trends over the past 15 years has been the rise of some of the largest markets around the world, that have led to a rapid and substantial increase in international trade and investment flows. The liberalisation and consequently the rise of emerging markets has today changed the economic geography for the business world, with companies entering these markets with the hope of getting superior returns arising from rapid economic growth and related market opportunities.  Amongst other emerging markets, the economic resurgence of the Indian market in the recent years has been widely noticed and in many senses has influenced and changed the structure and operations of businesses around the world. The prospects offered by India have allowed firms to substantially expand their activities beyond their domestic borders and access new growth opportunities generating significant productive growth. The benefits that markets like India today generate are likely to be particularly significance for New Zealand, given the small size of the domestic market. Indeed, increasing New Zealand&#8217;s exporting and international investing activity is vital to raising New Zealand&#8217;s growth rate. The rapid rise and deregulation of the Indian market has seen a rise in the number of New Zealand businesses keen to tap into the vast prospects across different sectors over the recent years. Nevertheless, New Zealand businesses have not been participating to nearly the same extent as most businesses from other small developed countries currently operating in the Indian market. Reasons for this limited interaction are unclear and not well documented in the current literature that examines the economic activities amongst the two markets. Given the importance of international engagement New Zealand businesses cannot afford to isolate themselves from the opportunities provided by the Indian market. Considering this, the main aim of this research is to focus on the opportunities that India provides and the benefits that New Zealand businesses stand to gain from those. On identifying, this may help devise actions that might lead to substantially increased levels of international investments by New Zealand firms, given the challenges of entering the Indian base from a small remote country. Drawing on insights gained from existing literature and case studies of companies operating in India, the research will identify appropriate strategies and policies that might help New Zealand businesses to succeed and better direct operations in India.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand businesses</field><field name="subject">Importance for internationalisation for New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Emerging markets</field><field name="subject">New Zealand and India</field><field name="subject">Sector opportunities for New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Challenges in India</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Least-squares optimal interpolation for direct image super-resolution : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gilman, Andrew</field><field name="description">Image super-resolution aims to produce a higher resolution representation of a scene from an ensemble of low-resolution images that may be warped, aliased, blurred and degraded by noise. There are a variety of methods for performing super-resolution described in the literature, and in general they consist of three major steps: image registration, fusion and deblurring. This thesis proposes a novel method of performing the first two of these steps. The ultimate aim of image super-resolution is to produce a higher-quality image that is visually clearer, sharper and contains more detail than the individual input images. Machine algorithms can not assess images qualitatively and typically use a quantitative error criterion, often least-squares. This thesis aims to optimise leastsquares directly using a fast method, in particular one that can be implemented using linear filters; hence, a closed-form solution is required. The concepts of optimal interpolation and resampling are derived and demonstrated in practice. Optimal filters optimised on one image are shown to perform nearoptimally on other images, suggesting that common image features, such as stepedges, can be used to optimise a near-optimal filter without requiring the knowledge of the ground-truth output. This leads to the construction of a pulse model, which is used to derive filters for resampling non-uniformly sampled images that result from the fusion of registered input images. An experimental comparison shows that a 10th order pulse model-based filter outperforms a number of methods common in the literature. The use of optimal interpolation for image registration linearises an otherwise nonlinear problem, resulting in a direct solution. Experimental analysis is used to show that optimal interpolation-based registration outperforms a number of existing methods, both iterative and direct, at a range of noise levels and for both heavily aliased images and images with a limited degree of aliasing. The proposed method offers flexibility in terms of the size of the region of support, offering a good trade-off in terms of computational complexity and accuracy of registration. Together, optimal interpolation-based registration and fusion are shown to perform fast, direct and effective super-resolution.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">image resolution</field><field name="subject">optimal filters</field><field name="subject">optimal interpolation</field><field name="subject">image registration</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software::291601 Arithmetic and logic structures</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/893</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of UHT-plant fouling by fresh, recombined and reconstituted whole milk : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Engineering</field><field name="creator">Srichantra, Arunee</field><field name="description">The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of preheat treatments on fouling by fresh whole milk (FWM), recombined whole milk (RCB) and reconstituted whole milk (Recon) in the high-temperature heater of indirect UHT plants. Various preheat treatments prior to evaporation during milk powder manufacture were applied to skim milk powder (SMP, 75 &#176;C 2 s, 85 &#176;C, 155 s and 95 &#176;C, 155 s) and whole milk powder (WMP, 95 &#176;C, 33 s). These preheat treatments were so-called &#8220;evaporator preheat treatments&#8221;. Skim milk powder (SMP) and whole milk powder (WMP) were derived from the same original batch of pasteurised FWM to remove the effects of the variation in milk composition between different milk batches. These SMPs were recombined with anhydrous milk fat and water to prepare RCB, and WMPs were reconstituted with water to prepare Recon. Then, (homogenized) FWM, RCB and Recon were subjected to various preheat treatments (75 &#176;C, 11 s, 85 &#176;C, 147 s and 95 &#176;C, 147 s) prior to UHT processing. These preheat treatments were so-called &#8220;UHT preheat treatments&#8221;. Temperature difference (hot water inlet temperature &#8211; milk outlet temperature) was taken as a measure of the extent of fouling in the high-temperature heater. The slope of the linear regression of temperature difference versus time (for two hours of UHT processing) was taken as fouling rate (&#176;C/h). Increasing both evaporator and UHT preheat treatments resulted in increasing fouling rate and total deposit weight for all three whole milk types for several milk batches. In the case of FWM, there was no reduction in fouling rate with increasing UHT preheat treatment whether FWM was homogenized then preheated, preheated then homogenized or not homogenized at all. These findings, which are wholly consistent and well replicated, are in apparent conflict with the results of most previous comparable studies. Possible reasons for this are explained. Further investigations of the effects of homogenization relating to the role of whey protein on the surface of the fat globules showed that whey protein associated with the membrane covering the surface of fat globules for homogenized then preheated FWM, RCB and Recon and that association increased with increasing heating process stage. The increasing association of whey protein with the milk fat globules membrane with increasing severity of heating process stage became faster when preheat treatment was more severe: the association of whey protein plateaued on intermediate temperature heating when the milks were preheated at 75&#176;C, 11 s and on preheating when the milks were preheated at 95&#176;C, 147 s. In the case of FWM, the thickness of the membrane covering the surface of fat globules for homogenized then preheated FWM, which increased with the severity of heating process stage, was greater than the thickness of the membrane in preheated then homogenized FWM. Preheating then homogenization resulted in the greater interfacial spreading of small molecules on the surface of fat globules, i.e. whey protein or small molecules from the disintegration of casein micelles during preheating. Possible basic mechanisms for UHT fouling in the high-temperature heater include: the reduction in the solubility of calcium phosphate and the deposition of protein as fat-bound protein and non-fat-bound protein. When non-fat-bound protein in milk plasma deposited, it could be a carrier for the deposition of mineral, such as, the precipitate of calcium phosphate in the casein micelles or the deposition of complexes between whey protein and casein micelles.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">milk powder manufacture</field><field name="subject">evaporator pre-heat treatments</field><field name="subject">UHT processing</field><field name="subject">casein micelles</field><field name="subject">milk protein</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oceanic grounds, architecture, the evental and the in-between : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment  of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design</field><field name="creator">Yates, Amanda</field><field name="description">Exploring spatio-temporal flux within architecture, this thesis presents design-based research on the temporal environments of Oceania and Western evental theory. Oceanic thought and Western theories of the event share commonalities, both holding that space and time are inseparable dimensions. This spatio-temporal concept challenges Western philosophical and architectural doxa that privilege stasis over temporal flux, and offers a mode by which to introduce alterity into architectural discourse. I move over these cultural and philosophical grounds in order to explicate and further develop a personal design practice that is of this place and time for, while there is a body of writing that documents Oceanic built environments, there is less research that considers how these may be constituted and communicated through contemporary architectural design. The thesis posits two temporalised environments apparent within Oceanic spatial thought and practice &#8211; the shifting and extensive oceanscape, and the telluric groundscape that makes space; and describes two resultant spatial typologies &#8211; an oceanspace which is characterised by openness and mobility, and a groundspace which is both surface and space. These contentions are tested and theorised through three architectural experiments developed between 1999 and 2005: the Sounds House, which operates as an open and mutable spatial field; the Ground House, which forms monumental &#8220;interiors&#8221; that emerge from and relate to the earth; and Tokatea, which blends these two spatialities, fabricating a temporalised environment in between the momentary and the monumental, between interior and exterior. In presenting and discussing these speculative spaces, this thesis moves between architecture and academia, Oceania and the West, the ephemeral and the enduring, and the inside and the outside, with the aim of destabilising architecture&#8217;s discursive ground, causing its hermetic boundaries to become temporalised and fluid.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">space and time</field><field name="subject">architectural design</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building::310100 Architecture and Urban Environment::310101 Architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The empty portrait : encounters with a photographer : an exegesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Fine Arts, Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Woods-Jack, Virginia</field><field name="description">The Empty Portrait forefronts a new experience of the portrait for all participants involved: the photographer, the subject, and the viewer.

For the first time, this receiver design explores and exploits the unique properties of UWB pulse technology. By exploiting low emission power limit and pulse based communication, RF circuits have been designed with reduced linearity to achieve low-power operation and better circuit performance.  The receiver design in this thesis follows a top-down approach which begins by focusing on UWB-specific issues such as signal characteristics, modulation schemes, potential advantages, and design challenges. Next, different receiver architectures are evaluated in terms of their circuit complexity, power consumption, and levels of integration. The impact of various analog non-idealities on the performance of UWB systems is also analysed in detail. After evaluating the performance of UWB systems operating with non-linear frontends, the use of pulse doublets is introduced, for the first time, to mitigate nonlinearityinduced distortion. Simulation results demonstrate that under non-linear operating conditions, significant BER improvements can be achieved by using filtering, pulse doublet, and direct sequence spread spectrum techniques. When ADC quantization effects are included in the receiver, analysis shows that quantization noise dominates distortion-induced BER degradation when two or three bits ADCs are employed. Consequently, reduced front-end linearity requirements can be tolerated in exchange for improvements in the more critical circuit parameters of the UWB receiver.  By adopting the sub-linear circuit design approach, a direct-conversion receiver prototype is implemented in the 0.5 um SOS CMOS technology according to specifications determined from system-level Simulink simulations. This highly integrated receiver prototype contains a low-noise amplifier, a 4-GHz frequency synthesizer, mixers, baseband amplifiers and filters, and 2-GSps two-bit analog-to-digital converters. The receiver prototype consumes 75-mW of power, the lowest amount for reported UWB receivers operating in the 3.1 to 10.6-GHz band. Complete end-to-end simulations of the system are performed in Simulink, revealing an achievable BER of approximately 8x10e-4  Finally, a novel 79-uW 5.6-GHz CMOS frequency divider with on-chip temperature and processing compensation have been designed. The divider, designed in a 0.25 um SOS-CMOS technology, occupies 35 x 25 um2 and achieves an operating frequency of 5.6-GHz while consuming 79-uW at a supply voltage of 0.8V. The power efficiency of 143-GHz/mW is one of the highest achieved among conventional CMOS dividers. When combined with a simple and effective compensation submodule, the proposed divider is shown to achieve process and temperature-insensitive operation in a 5-GHz UNII band frequency synthesizer.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ultra wideband</field><field name="subject">linearity tradeoff</field><field name="subject">system modelling</field><field name="subject">low power design</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and investigation of local optima in aerospace structural design</field><field name="creator">Shi, Jianming, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on research into the causes of local optima when optimization algorithms are applied to aerospace structural design. A thorough understanding of local optima will enable the engineers to select the algorithm for optimization or to guide the optimization to ensure either global optima or near optimal solutions are achieved. Therefore, a comprehensive literature review has been conducted and several illustrative examples have been identified to help fully understand the cause and importance of local optima. The first application involved the design of the internal structure of a simplified wing spoiler. MSC.NASTRAN was used to optimize each discretized location of an additional rib with the aid of a Patran Command Language (PCL) algorithm. The objective function of minimum weight was approximated as a multimodal function in a 2D smooth curve where the local and global optima were identified. The theory of continuous rectangular plates was used to explain the phenomena. The second problem considered buckling of a wing rib. A PCL code was written to obtain the rib buckling factors as the position of the center of a square cutout was varied within a constrained area. The rib linear buckling factor versus the centre position O(X, Y) of the square cutout was plotted in a 3D surface contour plot. Load path theory and relevant plate buckling theories were used to explain the local and global maxima identified. The final example considered the maximization of the buckling load of a simply supported composite laminated plate under in-plane loading. A conventional Genetic Algorithm was used to examine the local and global optima of the critical buckling load factor. Many local and global optima were identified and explained and many near-optimal solutions were found in a single run. A significant understanding of local optima in aerospace structural design with the optimal utilization of available software and the appropriate selection of optimization algorithms has been achieved. Further work could either include implementing the proposed global optimization strategies or include implementing rapid methods for identifying multiple local optima.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aerospace engineering</field><field name="subject">structural -- computer simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the key determinants in up-scaling undifferentiated growth of human embryonic stem cells in bioreactor systems</field><field name="creator">Prowse, Andrew Benjamin James, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Human Embryonic Stem (hES) cells will potentially have important applications in regenerative medicine, drug discovery and therapeutics. However, the current methods of hES cell culture limit their use in future applications due mostly to the inability to culture undifferentiated hES cells in sufficient numbers and the concern of animal derived products used in culture methods potentially implementing an immune rejection in transplantiation recipients. This project investigated two approaches for improving the culture of undifferentiated hES cells for future application in bioreactor systems. Firstly, proteins from the conditioned medium of three hES cell supportive fibroblast lines (human fetal, human neonatal and mouse embryonic fibroblasts) were identified using two-dimensional liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry. This proteomic analysis identified 175 unique proteins including those from key pathways already implicated in the maintenance of human embryonic stem cell pluripotency including the Wnt, BMP/TGF-&#946;1, activin/inhibin and insulin like growth factor-1 pathways. Identification of proteins in fibroblast conditioned medium will aid the development of a defined medium for undifferentiated hES cell culture. The second approach examined culture of hES cells in hypoxic conditions (5% O2) compared to standard normoxic conditions in CO2 incubators (20% O2). Feeder layer and feeder free culture conditions were examined in the two O2 concentrations. hES cell colonies grown in hypoxic culture had improved percentages of pluripotent cells (judged by increases in cells expressing SSEA-4, Tra-1-60 and nanog and reduction of BMP-4), stable karyotypes and increased proliferation. The maintenance of pluripotency, apoptosis and proliferation was complicated by the detection of the cell surface marker CD30. Proteomic identification and investigation into oxidative stress indicated the presence of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutases, catalases and peroxiredoxins in human fetal fibroblast conditioned medium and their regulation of redox homeostasis may play a significant role in the maintenance of hES cell pluripotency, apoptosis and proliferation. Together these investigations significantly contribute to the current body of knowledge for the undifferentiated culture of hES cells. Identification of conditioned medium proteins and the benefits of hypoxic culture of hES cells will aid the development of a defined, reproducible method of hES cell scale-up in bioreactor systems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41271</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catalytic fixed bed membrane reactor operation for hydrocarbon conversion processes</field><field name="creator">Althenayan, Faisal M., School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Dry/CO2 reforming is one the hydrocarbon processes that recently has been interesting due to it is ability of producing a lower synthesis gas ratio (H2/CO). This synthesis gas is a highly significant product since it costs more than 50% of the total capital cost of gas to liquid (GTL) process. However, since this reaction is thermodynamically limited, higher temperature or lower pressure is required to achieve higher conversion. Typically, reaction temperatures between 1073 and 1173 K are used for catalytic dry reforming reactions. Consequently, these extreme temperatures lead to a severe carbon deposition causing a catalyst deactivation which is the major difficulty related to CO2 reforming reaction. This has pushed the efforts to be focused mainly on the development of new catalysts. In fact, dry reforming of propane is an equilibrium-limited reaction which can be shifted to the product side by removing one of the products out of the system which can be achieved using a selective membrane reactor. This research is dedicated to investigate and study the catalytic performance of dry reforming of propane over cobalt-nickel catalyst under the temperature range of 773-973 K. This bimetallic catalyst supported on ??-Al2O3 has been utilized in this research since it exhibits better activity, selectivity, and deactivation resistance than monometallic catalysts. Based on this, the primary aims of this thesis are to examine this catalyst and to study the impact of using membrane reactor. In addition, the reaction mechanism and kinetic are investigated using a fixed-bed reactor. Experimental observations have exposed that the catalyst is offering good results under this reaction. The catalysts analysis has confirmed the presence of metal oxides in the catalyst. However, only at a lower carbon dioxide to propane ratio, i.e. lower than 3.5, a carbon signal has been reported. The activation energy study indicates that the process is unlimited by diffusion. The reaction order for propane and carbon dioxide has been found to be zero and 1.17 respectively. This in turn has indicated that C3H8 activation reaction  is taking place rapidly and carbon dioxide is suggested to be involved in the rate determining step. In membrane reactor operation, the production rates for H2 and CO have been reported to increase as the sweep gas flow rate increases. The co-current mode offers higher production rate and more stability than counter-current mode over the range of feed ratio. On the other hand, fixed bed reactor shows stable performance and produces more CO and H2 for both modes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Membrane reactors</field><field name="subject">Catalysts</field><field name="subject">Hydrocarbons</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The BUMP model of response planning: a neuroengineering account of speed-accuracy tradeoffs, velocity profiles, and physiological tremor in movement</field><field name="creator">Bye, Robin Trulssen, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Speed-accuracy tradeoffs, velocity profiles, and physiological tremor are fundamental characteristics of human movement. The principles underlying these phenomena have long attracted major interest and controversy. Each is well established experimentally but as yet they have no common theoretical basis. It is proposed that these three phenomena occur as the direct consequence of a movement response planning system that acts as an intermittent optimal controller operating at discrete intervals of ~100 ms. The BUMP model of response planning describes such a system. It forms the kernel of adaptive model theory which defines, in computational terms, a basic unit of motor production or BUMP. Each BUMP consists of three processes: (i) analysing sensory information, (ii) planning a desired optimal response, and (iii) executing that response. These processes operate in parallel across successive sequential BUMPs. The response planning process requires a discrete time interval in which to generate a minimum acceleration trajectory of variable duration, or horizon, to connect the actual response with the predicted future state of the target and compensate for executional error. BUMP model simulation studies show that intermittent adaptive optimal control employing two extremes of variable horizon predictive control reproduces almost exactly findings from several authoritative human experiments. On the one extreme, simulating spatially-constrained movements, a receding horizon strategy results in a logarithmic speed-accuracy tradeoff and accompanying asymmetrical velocity profiles. On the other extreme, simulating temporally-constrained movements, a fixed horizon strategy results in a linear speed-accuracy tradeoff and accompanying symmetrical velocity profiles. Furthermore, simulating ramp movements, a receding horizon strategy closely reproduces experimental observations of 10 Hz physiological tremor. A 100 ms planning interval yields waveforms and power spectra equivalent to those of joint-angle, angular velocity and electromyogram signals recorded for several speeds, directions, and skill levels of finger movement. While other models of response planning account for one or other set of experimentally observed features of speed-accuracy tradeoffs, velocity profiles, and physiological tremor, none accounts for all three. The BUMP model succeeds in explaining these disparate movement phenomena within a single framework, strengthening this approach as the foundation for a unified theory of motor control and planning.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optimal control</field><field name="subject">Motor planning</field><field name="subject">Movement invariants</field><field name="subject">Minimum acceleration trajectory</field><field name="subject">Submovements</field><field name="subject">Intermittency</field><field name="subject">Variability</field><field name="subject">Predictive control</field><field name="subject">Physiological tremor</field><field name="subject">Speed-accuracy tradeoff</field><field name="subject">Velocity profile</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stereo vision based obstacle avoidance in indoor environments</field><field name="creator">Chiu, Tekkie Tak-Kei, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an indoor obstacle avoidance system for car-like mobile robot. The system consists of stereo vision, map building, and path planning. Stereo vision is performed on stereo images to create a geometric map of the environment. A fast sparse stereo approach is employed. For different areas of the image there are different optimal values of disparity range. A multi-pass method to combine results at different disparity range is proposed. To reduce computational complexity the matching is limited to areas that are likely to generate useful data. The stereo vision system outputs a more complete disparity map. Abstract Map building involves converting the disparity map into map coordinates using triangulation and generating a list of obstacles. Occupancy grids are built to aid a hierarchical collision detection. The fast collision detection method is used by the path planner. Abstract A steering set path planner calculates a path that can be directly used by a car-like mobile robot. An adaptive approach using occupancy grid information is proposed to improve efficiency. Using a non-fixed steering set the path planner spends less computation time in areas away from obstacles. The path planner populates a discrete tree to generate a smooth path. Two tree population methods were trialled to execute the path planner. The methods are implemented and experimented on a real car-like mobile robot.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">path planning</field><field name="subject">stereo vision</field><field name="subject">obstacle avoidance</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neurotensin and its receptors in human isolated intestine in health and disease : focus on motility aspects</field><field name="creator">Azriel, Yael, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Neurotensin (NT) is a brain-gut peptide, localised to mucosal endocrine N-cells in the gastrointestinal tract. The most potent stimuli for NT release are ingested fats. NT, in vivo, inhibits the migrating myoelectric complex and stimulates colonic motility. The aim of this thesis was to investigate NT and its receptors in human isolated intestine, focusing on motility aspects. ???Normal??? colon and ileum were obtained from patients undergoing resection for carcinoma, and ???disease??? colon was obtained from patients undergoing resection for ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn???s disease (CD), diverticular disease (DD) and slow transit constipation (STC). In functional experiments with ???normal??? ascending and sigmoid colon, NT contracted taenia coli strips by direct mechanisms (EC50 ??? 100 nM). In circular muscle (CM) strips, contractions were mediated by NT-induced release of enteric mediators (indirect actions), which were regionally specific, as well as by direct actions on the smooth muscle. In contrast, in ???normal??? terminal ileum, the predominant action of NT was a potent (EC50 ??? 3 nM), directly mediated inhibition of spontaneous contractions in longitudinal muscle strips. NT receptors were characterised using radioligand binding with [125I]-NT and [3H]-NT, and localised using autoradiography and immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. In the sigmoid colon, binding sites corresponded to NTS1 receptors and could be visualised on the smooth muscle and the enteric ganglia, supporting both direct and neuronal actions for NT, respectively. In the ileum, a similar distribution of binding sites could be visualised. In gastrointestinal disease, NT contractile responses were reduced in UC, DD and STC colon CM strips, but were unchanged in CD. In contrast, NT responses in all diseases were largely unchanged in TC strips, suggesting disease/treatment-induced alterations in NT mechanisms. In UC, cholinergic mechanisms appeared to be altered, whereas in DD disease, prostaglandin mechanisms were affected. In STC, there was an apparent loss of a normally predominant component in NT-mechanisms, but contractile mechanisms appeared to be retained. In summary, these studies demonstrated regional and muscle layer specific actions and mechanisms of action for NT, and support alterations in enteric signaling in disease.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neurotensin</field><field name="subject">Intestines.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20828</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian Political Elites and Citizenship Education for 'New Australians' 1945-1960</field><field name="creator">JENKINGS, PATRICIA ANNE BERNADETTE</field><field name="description">This educational history thesis contributes to knowledge of citizenship education in Australia during the 1940s and 1950s. It provides unique perspectives on an important part of Australian citizenship educational history. This examination of citizenship education also helps to explain contemporary trends and the recent revival of citizenship education in multicultural Australia.   Following the Second World War, Australian political leaders initiated an unprecedented immigration programme to help develop and defend post-war Australia. The programme enjoyed bipartisan support and was extraordinary in terms of magnitude and nature. It became the catalyst for a citizenship education campaign orchestrated by Federal political leaders for the benefit of all Australians. The citizenship education campaign was, however, primarily aimed at non-British adult migrants. The intention of the Federal Government was to maintain the cultural hegemony of the Anglo-Celts evident in pre-war Australia. In accordance with government policy, the new arrivals were expected to assimilate into the Australian community and become loyal citizens. Citizenship rested on a common national language and thus, the focus was on teaching migrants of non-British origin English for the workplace, everyday intercourse and, as a means to dissuade migrant enclaves.   This thesis comprises of three sections which illustrate how the citizenship education campaign was extended through: (i) official education channels; (ii) the media, specifically the Australian Broadcasting Commission; and (iii) annual citizenship conventions which encompasses a case study of the Good Neighbour Movement in New South Wales. These particular areas have been chosen as they identify important and different ways the campaign was expressed and funded. Discussion of the financial arrangements concerning the implementation of the campaign is important as it uniquely illustrates the power of the Federal authorities to direct the campaign as they considered necessary. It also highlights conflict between Federal and State authorities in dealing with the education of new arrivals, primarily due to the traditional two-tier system of government extant in Australia.   The general theoretical framework of this thesis emanates from concepts and ideas of writers who illustrate, in general, the concentration of power within Australia society and supports this work's notion of a `top-down' paradigm, i.e. one invariably directed by the nation's political leaders. This paradigm is presented in an effort to provide an appreciation of the powerful nature of the Federal Government's immigration policy and citizenship education campaign in the dramatic post-war reconstruction period. The thesis is related to an elite theory of political change but with due consideration to issues of context, that is, Australian society in the 1940s and 1950s.   Understanding that there was a citizenship education campaign provides a novel means of appreciating post-war immigration policy. The campaign embedded and tied together multifarious notions extant in the Australian Government policy for the Australian community in meeting the challenges of a nation experiencing massive social and economic change. Significantly, this study helps to explain the shift from the Anglo-Celtic, mono-cultural view of citizenship to one that officially recognises the culturally diverse nature of Australian society today.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">citizenship;multiculturalism;immigration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/815</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Second Chance Journey... or...

In addition, despite support from both self-efficacy theory and coping theory, the relationship between coping self-efficacy and coping behaviour in the face of stressful events has not previously been considered. This thesis explores the importance of coping self-efficacy for psychological wellbeing in a new context, recovery after stroke, and investigates the relationship between coping self-efficacy and coping behaviour in the face of this stressor. Stroke was selected as a suitable context for this exploration given its high incidence, lengthy recovery period and the prevalence of significant post stroke psychological distress. The thesis explores four key questions: (i) is coping self-efficacy related to psychological wellbeing for people recovering from stroke, (ii) what types of coping behaviours are related to coping self-efficacy during recovery, (iii) does coping behaviour mediate the relationship between coping self-efficacy and psychological outcomes, and (iv) what is the role of individual dispositional traits (optimism and trait anxiety) in these relations. The implications of these relationships for clinical intervention were a secondary focus of the project.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adjustment (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease -- Patients -- Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Clinical health psychology</field><field name="subject">Self-efficacy</field><field name="subject">Stress (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Stroke</field><field name="subject">Health psychology</field><field name="subject">Coping self-efficacy</field><field name="subject">Coping</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of social work assessment with child protection cases in non-statutory settings</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Mark Edward</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a qualitative study investigating the understandings of social workers from non-statutory settings (health, hospital and mental health) of their assessment practices with children and families where child protection concerns have been identified. The study aims were to describe the considerations social workers identified as significant when undertaking such an assessment, as well as gain insight about how these considerations interact and relate.  The study was developed under a constructivist paradigm influenced by post-modern and post-structuralist thinking. Data collection involved a semi-structured in-depth interview based on concepts drawn from reflective practice and the critical incident technique. The participants were asked about their agency, their role and a recent case in which they had undertaken an assessment. Data collection and analysis were consistent with constructivist grounded theory methods.  Review of the literature suggests that social workers in statutory child protection practice and other settings consider factors relating to the case, themselves and their context in their assessment practice. Similar conclusions have been reached through this study. This study is unique in being the only qualitative study of social work assessment practices with child protection cases in non-statutory settings in NSW, to date.  The study found that social workers identified a range of considerations as important in their assessment practice. These considerations have been grouped thematically as context, relationship, intervention, content and self, in the presentation of findings in this thesis. These themes interact and relate in ways that are unique to the individual assessment circumstances rather than in a regular or consistent manner. The findings of the study are relevant to social work practitioners, educators and researchers. The study furthers the understanding of social work assessment practice, and develops a clearer understanding and articulation of what is recognised and termed as &#8216;tacit knowledge&#8217; or &#8216;practice wisdom&#8217; in this particular area of social work practice.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">assessment</field><field name="subject">social work</field><field name="subject">child protection</field><field name="subject">non-statutory setting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimisation of Urban Water Supply Headworks Systems Using Probabilistic Search Methods and Parallel Computing</field><field name="creator">Cui, Lijie</field><field name="description">Realistic optimisation of the operation and planning of urban water supply headworks systems requires that the issues of complexity and stochastic forcing be addressed. The only reliable way of accomplishing this is to use simulation models in conjunction with the Monte Carlo method which generates multiple hydro-climate replicates.  However, such models do not easily interface with traditional optimisation methods. Probabilistic search methods such as the genetic algorithm (GA) and the shuffled complex evolution method (SCE) can be coupled to a generalised simulation model and thus accommodate complexity as well as stochastic inputs. However, optimisation of complex urban water supply systems is computationally intractable if Monte Carlo methods have to be used.  This study first compared the GA and the SCE method using a simple case study. Both methods were found to cope well with the piecewise flat objective function surface typical of the headworks optimisation problem. This is because they have the inherent capability of vigorously exploring beyond the domain of a flat region. The SCE method is recommended especially when fast location of a good solution is desired. Nonetheless, the GA was preferred due to its inherent parallelism. Two methods were then explored to improve computational efficiency and turnaround time: parallel computing and replicate compression. The Sydney headworks system was used as a case study to investigate the key aspects of a full-scale headworks optimisation. It was concluded that the speedup was nearly proportional to the number of processors employed. Replicate compression can very significantly reduce the computational turnaround time for Monte Carlo simulation; unfortunately, this conclusion must be tempered by the limitation that the objective function depends on penalties arising from restrictions only. Critical analysis of the GA results suggested the optimised results were sound. The case study demonstrated the feasibility of parallel GA to identify near-optimal solutions for a complex system subject to stochastic forcing.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parallel computing</field><field name="subject">Optimisation</field><field name="subject">Water Supply</field><field name="subject">genetic algorithms</field><field name="subject">Monte Carlo</field><field name="subject">simulation models</field><field name="subject">water resources</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24965</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frequency domain analysis of sampled-data control systems</field><field name="creator">Braslavsky, Julio Hernan</field><field name="description">This thesis is aimed at analysis of sampled-data feedback systems. Our approach is in the frequency-domain, and stresses the study of sensitivity and complementary sensitivity operators. Frequency-domain methods have proven very successful in the analysis and design of linear time-invariant control systems, for which the importance and utility of sensitivity operators is well-recognized. The extension of these methods to sampled-data systems, however, is not straightforward, since they are inherently time-varying due to the intrinsic sample and hold operations.  In this thesis we present a systematic frequency-domain framework to describe sampled-data systems considering full-time information. Using this framework, we develop a theory of design limitations for sampled-data systems. This theory allows us to quantify the essential constraints in design imposed by inherent open-loop characteristics of the analog plant. Our results show that: (i) sampled-data systems inherit the difficulty imposed upon analog feedback design by the plant's non-minimum phase zeros, unstable poles, and time-delays, independently of the type of hold used; (ii) sampled-data systems are subject to additional design limitations imposed by potential non-minimum phase zeros of the hold device; and (iii) sampled-data systems, unlike analog systems, are subject to limits upon the ability of high compensator gain to achieve disturbance rejection.  As an application, we quantitatively analyze the sensitivity and robustness characteristics of digital control schemes that rely on the use of generalized sampled-data hold functions, whose frequency-response properties we describe in detail.  In addition, we derive closed-form expressions to compute the L2-induced norms of the sampled-data sensitivity and complementary sensitivity operators. These expressions are important both in analysis and design, particularly when uncertainty in the model of the plant is considered. Our methods provide some interesting interpretations in terms of signal spaces, and admit straightforward implementation in a numerically reliable fashion.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sampled-data systems</field><field name="subject">Frequency response</field><field name="subject">Performance limitations</field><field name="subject">Sensitivity analysis</field><field name="subject">Generalized sampled-data holds.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24783</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interrupting History: A critical-reconceptualisation of History curriculum after 'the end of history'</field><field name="creator">Parkes, Robert John Lawrence</field><field name="description">Contemporary Italian philosopher, Gianni Vattimo (1991), has described &#8216;the end of history&#8217; as a motif of our times. While neo-liberal conservatives such as Francis Fukuyama (1992) celebrated triumphantly, and perhaps rather prematurely after the fall of the Berlin Wall, &#8216;the end of history&#8217; in the &#8216;inevitable&#8217; global acceptance of the ideologies of free market capitalism and liberal democracy, methodological postmodernists (including Barthes, Derrida, Baudrillard, Lyotard, and Foucault), mobilised &#8216;the end of history&#8217; throughout the later half of the twentieth century as a symbol of a crisis of confidence in the discourse of modernity, and its realist epistemologies. This loss of faith in the adequacy of representation has been seen by many positivist and empiricist historians as a threat to the discipline of history, with its desire to recover and reconstruct &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;the truth&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; of the past. It is argued by defenders of &#8216;traditional&#8217; history (from Appleby, Hunt, &amp; Jacob, 1994; R. J. Evans, 1997; Marwick, 2001; and Windschuttle, 1996; to Zagorin, 1999), and some postmodernists (most notably, Jenkins, 1999), that if we accept postmodern social theory, historical research and writing will become untenable. This study re-examines the nature of the alleged &#8216;threat&#8217; to history posed by postmodernism, and explores the implications of postmodern social theory for History as curriculum. Situated within a broadly-conceived critical-reconceptualist trend in curriculum inquiry, and deploying a form of historically and philosophically oriented &#8216;deconstructive hermeneutics&#8217;, the study explores past attempts to mount, and future possibilities for, a curricular response to the problem of historical representation. The analysis begins with an investigation of &#8216;end of history&#8217; discourse in contemporary theory. It then proceeds through a critical exploration of the social meliorist changes to, and cultural politics surrounding, the History curriculum in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, from the Bicentennial to the Millennium (1988-2000), a period that marked curriculum as a site of contestation in a series of highly public &#8216;history wars&#8217; over representations of the nation&#8217;s past (Macintyre &amp; Clark, 2003). It concludes with a discussion of the missed opportunities for &#8216;critical practice&#8217; within the NSW History curriculum. Synthesising insights into the &#8216;nature of history&#8217; derived from contemporary academic debate, it is argued that what has remained uncontested in the struggle for &#8216;critical histories&#8217; during the period under study, are the representational practices of history itself. The study closes with an assessment of the (im)possibility of History curriculum after &#8216;the end of history&#8217;. I argue that if History curriculum is to be a critical/transformative enterprise, then it must attend to the problem of historical representation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">history curriculum</field><field name="subject">historiography</field><field name="subject">pedagogy</field><field name="subject">curriculum theory</field><field name="subject">poststructuralism</field><field name="subject">postmodernism</field><field name="subject">end of history</field><field name="subject">history theory</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">deconstruction</field><field name="subject">representation</field><field name="subject">neo-liberalism</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">deconstructive hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">social meliorist</field><field name="subject">cultural politics</field><field name="subject">Bicentennial</field><field name="subject">Millennium</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">syllabus</field><field name="subject">history wars</field><field name="subject">critical pedagogy</field><field name="subject">critical practice</field><field name="subject">counter memory</field><field name="subject">historical representation</field><field name="subject">histories</field><field name="subject">critical history</field><field name="subject">public memory</field><field name="subject">collective memory</field><field name="subject">historical imagination</field><field name="subject">indigenous history</field><field name="subject">curriculum reform</field><field name="subject">curriculum history</field><field name="subject">genealogy</field><field name="subject">poststructuralist curriculum theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24969</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Competing for Life: Older People and Competitive Sport</field><field name="creator">Dionigi, Rylee Ann</field><field name="description">In Western society competing in physically demanding sport is not considered the domain of older people.  For the majority of the twentieth century older people were stereotyped as frail, socially withdrawn and dependent on health and social welfare systems.  Competitive athletes on the other hand are commonly viewed as being young, strong, aggressive, physically competent and independent.  Although today&#8217;s older generation are encouraged to be physically active, society does not recognise serious competition or physically intense sports as age-appropriate activities for them.  If older people choose to participate in sport they are expected to be doing it to have fun, make friends and keep fit.  The growing leisure phenomenon of older athletes who compete to win, achieve a personal best, break world records or push their bodies to the limit presents a challenge to these orthodoxies.  The purpose of this thesis is to explain why competing in physically demanding sport is significant to some older people given the accepted view that it is not their domain.  In particular, the thesis explores the multiple ways in which a group of older people negotiate conflicting discourses of both sport and ageing, as well as the contradiction between their identity as an athlete and their ageing bodies, as they talk about and experience competing in physically strenuous individual and team sports.  The key themes through which this negotiation process is played out relate to friendship and fun, competition, youthfulness, and the ageing body.  It is revealed that the process of competing in sport can be simultaneously empowering and problematic at both the individual and social levels.  The thesis draws on insights from post-structural theories of resistance and empowerment, traditional and postmodern understandings of identity management in later life, and life-stage theories to interpret the phenomenon of older people competing in physically demanding sport.  To achieve the above aims, a qualitative study exploring the experiences of a group of Masters athletes aged over 55 years who regularly compete in physically strenuous individual or team sports was undertaken.  It was found that despite age-appropriate norms, competition is significant to many of the participants.  Study participants embrace the ideologies and practices of competitive sport and use them to define ageing in terms of youthfulness, physical ability and personal empowerment.   Simultaneously however, a denial of, or desperate resistance to, the physical ageing process accompanies this feeling of empowerment. The participants in this study were not only competing in sport, but also &#8216;competing for life&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;.  It is argued that a multi-faceted and conflicting interplay of resistance and conformity, empowerment and denial, identity and the ageing body is embedded in the phenomenon of older people competing in physically demanding sport.  These contradictory findings expose alternative ways of understanding sport, competition, ageing and older people in the West and raise many questions requiring further investigation.

However, few have investigated the experiences and interactions of both this group of patients and their main informal carers (principal lay support persons) simultaneously.  This study has sought to rectify this situation by capturing and undertaking a theoretical analysis of the perceptions and experiences of both critically ill patients and their principal lay support persons.  As a result a substantive theory has been developed through the use of grounded theory method in the Study.  This theory identifies and explains the actions and interactions between critically ill patients and their principal lay support persons who participated in the Study, whom the researcher observed and interviewed during the data collection period.  Data were collected during the critically ill participant&#161;&#166;s hospitalisation and three months following his/her discharge from hospital.  Implications of the study concern nursing practice as well as outcomes of the Study as these are described and explained through the substantive theory developed from it.  Testing of this theory in the context of critically ill patients and their lay support persons provides opportunities for further research, as does the overall phenomenon of lay person support for critically ill patients.  Grounded theory was the method used in the Study.  Data for the Study were collected by participant observation of, and face-to-face interviews with patients who had a critical illness and their principal lay support persons.  Two interviews were conducted with each of these participants.  Patients and their principal lay support persons were initially interviewed separately to obtain information about their individual perspectives of what support meant to them during an episode of critical illness.  A second interview was conducted three months later to facilitate the researcher&#161;&#166;s understanding of both patients&#161;&#166; and principal lay support persons&#161;&#166; experiences during the recovery process.  A total of sixteen (16) interviews were conducted in this study from eleven (11) participants before data saturation occurred.  The data collected were analysed by constant comparative analysis integral to the grounded theory approach.  Data analysis was also facilitated by a computer-aided qualitative data analysis software NUD*IST 4 (Non-numerical Unstructured Data Indexing, Searching, and Theorizing Version 4).  This software aided the analysis to the extent that it provided an efficient data management system.  Three categories, 1) being-there-with, 2) independing, and 3) coping were discovered from the data.  Being-there-with is an essential and mutual need between the patients and their principal lay support persons during the episode of critical illness and later recovery.  Independing on the other hand is the process through which these patients experiment with regaining their independence.  It involves their experiences of making decisions and re-building confidence.  Coping is the process whereby the principal lay support persons and patients manage their stress during the critical illness and later recovery.  During the coping process, there is an uncertainty in principal lay support persons about their loved ones&#161;&#166; situation.  They experience &#161;&#165;coping with each day as it comes&#161;&#166; and &#161;&#165;learn to adjust&#161;&#166; to the stress arising from the changing and unpredictable condition of the patients.  Being-there-with is also a major coping strategy for both the principal lay support persons and patients to manage their stress.  The three categories of being-there-with, independing, and coping arising from this Study provided the basis from which to identify its core category, &#161;&#165;mutually being-there-with each other&#161;&#166;, and to theorize the core process that represents the substantive theory about experiences and interactions of principal lay support persons and their loved ones during a critical illness situation.  The core process that represents the developed substantive theory is &#161;&#165;surviving a critical illness through mutually being-there-with each other&#161;&#166;.  This theory explains the complex, dynamic, and interactive nature of principal lay person support which both patients and principal lay support persons experienced during an episode of critical illness and later recovery.  An understanding of this dynamic, complex and interdependent relationship between patients and lay support persons will better enable nurses to consider both these parties as the focus of their care.  Furthermore, because the substantive theory emerging from this Study captures the process of patients&#161;&#166; and lay support persons&#161;&#166; recovery from an episode of critical illness it provides a conceptual map of how this process may progress.  In this Study the theory enables nurses to gauge both patients&#161;&#166; and lay support persons&#161;&#166; progress along the road to recovery and to consider this in their plan of care.  Several implications for nursing practice emerged from this study.  These relate to the needs of critically ill patients and their principal lay support persons during the process of being critically ill and recovering which they experienced together.  Because this Study identified the importance to both patients and principal lay support persons being-there-with each other, a key implication of the study is the need for intensive care units to adopt flexible visiting hours to maximise opportunities for this to occur.  Nevertheless, at the same time nurses need to be vigilant that flexible visiting does not prove onerous and overtire patients or their principal lay support persons.  A further implication of the Study for nursing practice closely related to its finding of the importance of the core category &#161;&#165;mutually being-there-with each other&#161;&#166; to patients and their lay support persons in the context of critical illness and recovery, is the need for nurses  (and other health professionals) to be willing to care for both parties as an inseparable dyadic unit.  This Study also has implications relating to the care of critically ill patients following their discharge home.  The experience of participants in this Study revealed the importance of careful discharge planning, post-ICU follow-up, and continuity of care in the community to enhance recovery of the patients and to address the special needs of their principal lay support persons.  From a researcher&#161;&#166;s perspective the process of recruitment for this study demonstrated that recruitment of vulnerable populations (like ICU patients) is a challenge to the researcher in terms of ethical considerations, particularly when the researcher is attempting to meet the expectation of primary selection for theoretical sampling in grounded theory method.  Suggestions are made in this thesis about how to tackle this challenge in future studies.  At the conclusion of the Study, a number of suggestions for further research are made relating to the findings.  These include the recommendation that the substantive theory developed in this Study be tested with a larger population.  It is also suggested that a longitudinal follow-up study, which extends beyond a three months recovery period, be conducted to further understand the experiences and support needs of post-ICU patients and their principal lay support persons.  In addition, more research is required to identify best practice regarding discharge planning, post-ICU follow-up care, and continuity of care in the community for critically ill patients and their principal lay carers.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">critical illness</field><field name="subject">informal carers</field><field name="subject">support</field><field name="subject">being there</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24696</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generalisation of the &#8220;Directional Simulation in the Load Space&#8221; Approach to Structural Reliability Analysis</field><field name="creator">Gray, William Arnold</field><field name="description">The reliability of structures subjected to time-invariant or time-variant random loads is considered herein. This is an important field of engineering, as it provides the framework for assessing whether newly designed or existing structural systems meet their design requirements in a given lifetime, or whether they experience what is termed &#8220;structural failure&#8221;. An important aspect of reliability analysis is the study of structures subjected to multiple time-varying loads. For this class of systems, it is well-known that by modelling the loads as (time-variant) random processes, the reliability may be evaluated by considering the outcrossing of a vector process out of a safe domain. However, due to the possibility that the loads may not be fully-dependent, all loads may not necessarily contribute to structural failure. To account for this the treatment of vector-outcrossings may need to allow for the possibility of outcrossings being caused by individual loads, as distinct from combinations of all loads. The procedure used to analyse combinations of loads depends on the stochastic process model used to represent the loads. Two well-known load models have been presented in the literature&#8212;they are referred to herein as the &#8216;on-off&#8217; model and the &#8216;standard&#8217; model. The &#8216;on-off&#8217; model typically assumes loads are non-negative, and are either &#8216;on&#8217; (eg their value is non-zero) or &#8216;off&#8217; (eg their value is strictly zero). They can contribute to failure only when they are &#8216;on&#8217;. This model is represented by a somewhat artificial &#8216;composite&#8217; probability distribution, obtained by modifying the original load probability density function (pdf) so that a &#8216;finite&#8217; non-zero probability represents explicitly the possibility that the load is &#8216;off&#8217;. To implement this model in time-variant analysis, it is necessary to consider all possible combinations of loads being &#8216;on&#8217; and &#8216;off&#8217;. In contrast, the &#8216;standard&#8217; model (which is the more commonly used) typically allows loads to be negative; it is also typically represented solely by the original load pdf, and therefore effectively assumes each load is always &#8216;on&#8217;. To allow for the possibility of one or more loads not to cause failure, herein the value of such loads is held &#8216;constant&#8217; at the time of failure, when the value of all loads actually causing failure is allowed to change. Use of the &#8216;standard&#8217; model is examined herein. The &#8220;Directional Simulation in the Load Space (DS-LS)&#8221; approach is a tool used to perform reliability analysis. It is particularly suitable for time-variant analysis, as it allows loads to be represented as random processes, and to be modelled properly. DS-LS has so far been shown to work well for relatively simple structures subjected to one or more time-invariant random loads, and has been used to examine vector outcrossings in systems comprising either discrete or continuous loads. To enable the proper consideration of load combinations, and to provide some improvements in the formulation of the technique, a generalisation of the DS-LS approach is proposed herein. The generalisation is achieved in two stages. The first involves modifying the time-invariant and time-variant DS-LS formulation to allow for the possibility of positioning the origin of DS-LS not only in the &#8216;safe&#8217; region of the load space (which the formulation currently requires) but in the &#8216;failure&#8217; region, or even &#8216;exactly&#8217; on the boundary separating the safe and failure regions. The modifications are necessary because for even simple structures, the &#8216;exact&#8217; location of the safe and failure region is not always known explicitly &#8216;a priori&#8217;. The second involves developing the time-variant DS-LS formulation to consider explicitly outcrossings caused by combinations of one or more loads, during analysis of systems comprising stationary continuous gaussian loads. To do this, the direction of the load process vector is &#8216;fixed&#8217; at each point of outcrossing, to physically represent the particular combination of loads causing the outcrossing. By considering each possible load combination, all loads not causing an outcrossing are then held constant during radial integration, thereby modelling those that do not contribute to each outcrossing. The proposed formulation differs from most load combination analysis techniques (which, evidently, simplify the analysis) as it is analytically &#8216;exact&#8217;, and it considers explicitly all possible combinations of loads. The concepts and formulations proposed herein may provide further understanding of reliability analysis performed by DS-LS (or other techniques) and may aid their future development.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Directional Simulation in the Load Space</field><field name="subject">Structural Reliability Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24767</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of electron irradiation on the morphology, modification and microstructure of talc powder</field><field name="creator">Hauptstein, Anneliese, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Electron irradiation may be a useful method for treating inorganic cosmetic powders such as talc for undesirable microorganisms if it can be established that no loss of quality or efficacy results as a consequence of the technique. A commercial electron accelerator was used to prepare bulk samples by exposure to electron irradiation under different conditions. A morphological characterisation of the control talc was carried out using microscopy techniques and focused on the particle size, shape and surface features of individual particles. Asperity dimensions vs. Roughness values were compared. Assessment of the bulk properties of the powders as a function of absorbed dose showed no serious impact on the quality or efficacy of the powder for cosmetic applications. The particle size and the level of dust expelled during impact were maintained. Changes to the surface chemistry of the irradiated powders were apparent from an increase in pH and water retention with increasing dose. Improvements to the fragrance retention occurred for both irradiated powders tested. Importantly a satisfactory microorganism level was achieved with the lowest absorbed dose level tested i.e. 5 kGy. Analysis of the crystallography did not show the development of a new phase. Mechanical testing using a slip-peel tester found an increase in the stick-slip behaviour occurred for the powder exposed to the highest absorbed dose only. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) testing of the lift-off force showed an increase in adhesion with increasing dose. Surface roughness increased with dose, while no change in elastic properties was found using nanoindentation suggesting the differentiating factor is due to surface features. Microstructural analysis used the transmission electron microscope (TEM). Voids were observed, which decrease in size, yet increase in number with increasing voltage. Prior to void development a loss of crystalinity is seen using electron diffraction. Explorative data analysis using factor analysis and Independent Component Analysis was performed on the void development data to discover the controlling mechanisms. Two distinct normally distributed populations were identified, each driven by 2-3 critical mechanisms. The distinct behaviour differences of the mechanisms may be utilised for characterisation of more complex properties of crystal microstructures.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Irradiation.</field><field name="subject">Morphology.</field><field name="subject">Talc.</field><field name="subject">Microstructure.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alcohol, endotoxin and the pancreas (induction, progression and reversibility of alcoholic pancreatitis)</field><field name="creator">Vonlaufen, Alain, Clinical School - South Western Sydney, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis pertains to the pathogenesis of alcoholic pancreatitis, a considerable burden in terms of morbidity, mortality and health related costs. It has long been known that only a minority of alcoholics develop clinically evident pancreatitis, suggesting that (an) additional trigger factor(s) is required to elicit overt disease. Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide LPS), from gut-derived gram negative bacteria may be one such trigger factor, since alcoholics exhibit increased levels of serum endotoxin. In addition, the degree of endotoxinaemia has been reported to correlate with the severity of pancreatitis. Studies described in this thesis report, i) the development of a novel rodent model of alcoholic pancreatitis produced by challenging alcohol-fed animals with single or repeated doses of LPS. The animals exhibit features of  both acute (acinar vacuolisation, necrosis, pancreatic oedema, haemorrhage and inflammatory infiltration) and chronic (acinar atrophy and pancreatic fibrosis) pancreatitis; ii) the reversion of pancreatic injury (including fibrosis) upon withdrawal of alcohol in the model and the persistence of pancreatic damage with continuation of alcohol feeding; iii) activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs, known to play a central role in fibrogenesis) in vivo and in vitro by alcohol and LPS; iv) the inhibition of PSC apoptosis in vivo and in vitro upon exposure to alcohol and LPS and the induction of PSC apoptosis in vivo upon withdrawal of alcohol from the diet and v) the presence of LPS receptors TLR4 and CD14 on PSCs, which would explain the responsiveness of PSCs to LPS.  Thus the work in this thesis provides strong evidence in support of endotoxin as a clinically relevant trigger factor for the initiation of alcoholic pancreatitis and as a factor that promotes disease progression. The thesis also provides the first experimental evidence to support the clinical reports of a beneficial effect of abstinence on chronic pancreatitis. Delineation of the mechanisms mediating the induction, progression and reversibility of alcoholic pancreatitis has the potential to direct the development of new therapeutic interventions for alcohol-related pancreatic injury.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stellate cells.</field><field name="subject">Alcoholic pancreatitis.</field><field name="subject">Fibrosis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43721</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tracing the invisible</field><field name="creator">Greig, Anne, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This project stems from a personal experience, when I saw an image of my magnified blood cells skimming erratically across a computer screen. This interaction with technology and parts of myself that are usually unseen prompted my explorations into this area of research -  the realm of the invisible. This broad and fascinating field of enquiry has preoccupied artists for millennia and has led me into an exploration of art, science and philosophy and how these disciplines have explored the realms beyond the senses. In particular, I have found that a convergence of these previously independent areas of thought is manifesting within contemporary culture as the advance of technology reveals more and more the mysteries of the universe. Developments in physics and cosmology, in particular, challenge our ideas about reality and how we perceive it, and raise questions about our place within the scheme of things that are having a big impact on contemporary thought.  My project engages with a cluster of issues concerning the impact of technology on visual representation. My area of studio practice is contemporary painting. In this exegesis I establish the context for my project by showing how advances in technology have influenced our visual representations of reality, and how these developments have always been and continue to be an area of fascination to artists.  We are currently subject to vast amounts of information and an abundance of visual material emanating from science and technology, which has not only permeated the popular imagination but has influenced our conceptions of how we represent the universe. Lens-based technologies continue to reveal information that challenges and alters our understanding of the underlying structure of the physical world and beyond. At the microscopic end of the scale scientists search amongst sub-atomic particles for new dimensions, whilst information from deep space reveals the ripples from the beginning of time - the big bang. At the same time, the fractal geometry of chaos theory makes visible the shapes embedded in the fabric of motion; the self-similarity of fractals are a way of seeing infinity.  This paper locates my project within this area of visual enquiry via a discussion of the work of some contemporary artists who share an interest in this broad and perhaps limitless field. In painting, this field has its origins in the pioneering abstractionists of the early 20th Century, who were also influenced by the scientific and technological advances of their time. Within this discussion I have situated the relevant scientific developments that relate both to the historical trajectory of art and to my own practice, as well as engage with some of the philosophical issues that arise from this subject.  Chapter one introduces a convergence of science and philosophy, where current cosmology points to a metaphysical notion of holism in which all things are interconnected. Chapter two discusses how the advance of lens-based technologies to probe the unseen realms in the early 20th Century influenced representations of a world beyond appearances that had a huge impact on artists. Chapter three looks at how our developing knowledge of natural systems influenced biomorphic abstraction in early 20th Century painting and links the exploration of chance and automatism in Dadaism with scientific notions of randomness and uncertainty. Chapter four discusses the contemporary field and how the practice of artists such as Ross Bleckner and Mark Francis, among others, have also produced a technological aesthetic influenced by developments in representation stemming from physics and cosmology. Chapter five locates my own studio practice within this context and describes the motivations and processes integral to my work in relation to the metaphysical implications of the field of enquiry that this project engages with.  When viewed within this context of art, philosophy and science, the final outcome of my project is an exploration of the unity of the underlying structure of existence.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaporated solid-phase crystallised poly-silicon thin film solar cells on glass</field><field name="creator">Kunz, Oliver, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The cost of photovoltaic electricity needs to be significantly reduced in order to achieve a high electricity market penetration.  Thin-film solar cells have good potential to achieve such cost savings though (i) large-area deposition onto low-cost foreign substrates, (ii) more streamlined processing, (iii) monolithic cell interconnection, and very efficient use of the expensive semiconductor material.  Polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) on glass is a promising technology for the cost-effective large volume production of PV modules since it (i) makes use of an abundant raw material, (ii) is non-toxic, (iii) does not suffer from light-induced degradation, and (iv) does not rely on TCO layers.  Usually plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) is used for the layer formation.  This thesis explores the use of e-beam evaporation as deposition method since it is potentially much faster and cheaper than PECVD.  The resulting solar cells are referred to as EVA (from EVAporation).  Two inherent shunting mechanisms in EVA cells are demonstrated to be shunting through sub-micron sized pinholes when the back electrode is deposited and shunting between the emitter and the absorber layer at the glass-side electrode.  Through the improved understanding of these shunting mechanisms it was possible to develop a suitable metallisation scheme for EVA cells using an aligned deposition of emitter and back surface field line contacts and a specially developed shunt mitigation etching technique.  For the first time appreciable efficiencies of up to 5.2% were demonstrated on this material.  It was also shown that only very lightly doped absorber layers can lead to the required high short-circuit currents in EVA cells.  The resulting cells are currently completely limited by space charge region recombination occurring with comparatively low ideality factors of only ~ 1.4  This thesis also demonstrates the usefulness of Jsc-Suns measurements and investigates optical loss mechanisms in the current devices.  Advanced modelling of distributed series resistance effects, influencing Suns-Voc, m-Voc and Jsc-Suns curves, is employed.  PC1D modelling is used to extract relevant device parameters.  In this work it was found that the diffusion length in the best EVA cells is longer than the absorber layer and that insufficient light trapping is currently the major hurdle to higher cell efficiencies.  From the obtained results it can be concluded that EVA solar cells are promising candidates for the low-cost and high-volume production of solar modules.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polycrystalline silicon</field><field name="subject">Polycrystalline silicon</field><field name="subject">Silicon thin-film solar cells</field><field name="subject">Evaporated silicon</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel uses of titanium dioxide for silicon solar cells</field><field name="creator">Richards, Bryce Sydney, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin films have a long history in silicon photovoltaics (PV) as antireflection (AR) coatings due to their excellent optical properties and low deposition cost. This work explores several novel areas where TiO2 thin films could be use to enhance silicon (Si) solar cell performance while reducing device fabrication costs. Amorphous, anatase and rutile TiO2 thin films are deposited using ultrasonic spraydeposition (USD) and chemical vapour deposition (CVD) systems, both designed and constructed by the author. Initial experiments confirmed that no degradation in the bulk minority carrier lifetime (????bulk) occurred during high-temperature processing, although the stability of the USD-deposited TiO2 films was dependent on the furnace ambient. A major disadvantage of TiO2 AR coatings is that they afford little surface passivation. In this work, a novel method of achieving excellent surface passivation on TiO2-coated silicon wafers is presented. This involved growing a 6 nm-thick SiO2 layer at the TiO2:Si interface by oxidising the wafer after TiO2 film deposition. The increase in surface passivation afforded by the interfacial SiO2 layer results in a decrease in the emitter dark saturation current density (J0e) by nearly two orders of magnitude to 4.7 ??? 7.7 ??~ 10???14 A/cm2. This demonstrates the compatibility of the TiO2/SiO2 stack with high-efficiency solar cells designs. By varying the film deposition and annealing conditions, TiO2 refractive indices in the range of 1.726 ??? 2.633 (at ???? = 600 nm) could be achieved. Subsequently, a double-layer antireflection (DLAR) coating was designed comprised of low and high TiO2 refractive index material. The best experimental weighted average reflectance (Rw) achieved was 6.5% on a planar silicon wafer in air. TiO2 DLAR coatings are ideally suited to multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers, which do not respond well to chemical texturing. Modelling performed for a glass and ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulated buried-contact solar cell indicated that a TiO2 DLAR coating afforded a 7% increase in the short circuit current density, when compared to a standard, commercially-deposited TiO2 single-layer AR coating. Finally, it is demonstrated that chemical reactions with phosphorus prevent TiO2 from acting as a successful phosphorus diffusion barrier or dopant source. The applicability of TiO2 thin films to various silicon solar cell structures is discussed.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Solar cells</field><field name="subject">Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Titanium dioxide</field><field name="subject">Silicon oxide films</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20476</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the demagnetisation process and possible alternative magnetic treatments for naval vessels</field><field name="creator">Baynes, Timothy Malcolm, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Naval submarines and surface ships are regularly subjected to a treatment called &amp;quotdeperming&amp;quot that seeks to design the vessel???s permanent magnetisation for optimal magnetic camouflage. A scaled model of a magnetic treatment facility (MTF) has been established as a valid system to simulate deperming and used to investigate various aspects of the deperm process including: magnetic anisotropy and demagnetising fields as factors in the physical modelling of magnetism in whole vessels; a comparison of current and alternative deperm procedures; the application of theoretical models of bulk magnetisation to calculate deperm outcomes in the physical model and in actual vessels. A &amp;quotlaboratory MTF&amp;quot was constructed to imitate the applied field geometry at a naval MTF. The system was calibrated and it was determined that the laboratory MTF could make magnetic measurements on a CU200T-G steel bar sample with an equivalent accuracy (error = ??5%) to that of standard magnetometric equipment. Experiments were conducted with emphasis on a holistic approach to modelling the deperm process and describing magnetisation changes in whole objects. The importance of the magnetic anisotropic changes to steel with cold rolling was confirmed. In CU200T-G steel sheet the initial susceptibility (ci) was found to increase by a factor of 3 ??0.1 in the rolling direction, from a value of ~ 110 in the un-rolled steel sheet (thickness dependent). ci in the rolled sheet transverse to the rolling direction was decreased by a factor of 0.94 ??0.09 to ci in the un-rolled sheet steel. Previous studies on hull steel have neglected to account for this transformation through cold work. The demonstration on mild steel here is expected to have an analogy in the final state of the hull sheet steel as it resides in a submarine pressure hull. Future studies either on hull material or on modelling whole vessels should include the same or similar magnetic anisotropic properties in the steel(s) under investigation. Hollow circular tubes made from CA2S-E and CU200T-G steel sheet were selected as models for vessels. It was shown that these steel tubes were a good choice in this regard: minimising the complexity of the experiment whilst maintaining the validity of a deperm simulation. During a deperm there was an excellent qualitative likeness in the permanent longitudinal magnetisation (PLM) for the steel tubes to PLM in both a submarine and a surface vessel. Permanent vertical magnetisation (PVM) deperm results from the tubes displayed a close qualitative match with PVM in a submarine but not in a surface vessel. A theoretical treatment for demagnetisation factors (Nd) in hollow ellipsoids was used in conjunction with a geometrical approximation to calculate Nd for finite hollow objects of revolution. Subsequent theoretical calculations correlated well with experimental results for measured effective ci (ceff) in hollow circular CU200T-G steel tubes of various lengths and aspect ratios. Using an estimate of 100 as ci for submarine hull steel, the same analysis produces Nd for the axial and transaxial directions in a submarine equal to 5.97??10-3 and 0.0142 respectively. Three items for potential improvement were identified in the current deperm protocol used on naval vessels (Flash-D): redundancy in the protocol; the duration of the deperm and a theoretical basis for predicting the final magnetisation or changes in magnetisation during a deperm. Simulations of a novel &amp;quotanhysteretic deperm&amp;quot method, designed to combat these issues, compared favourably to the Flash-D protocol. The standard deviation (s) of the final PVM from 30 Flash-D deperms on steel tubes was 206 A/m; for the final PVM from 30 anhysteretic deperms of the same duration, this was 60 A/m. The s for the final PLM for Flash-D and anhysteretic deperms of the same duration were 416 A/m and 670 A/m respectively. The conclusion is that adopting the anhysteretic deperm on actual vessels would improve the reliability of the PVM outcome. Though the procedure would demand the same duration as Flash-D, there is the advantage of saving time by not having to repeat deperms to obtain the desired result. Additionally the anhysteretic deperm is considerably more amenable to theoretical analysis. A modified version of Langevin???s equation was used to predict the final PLM and PVM results for anhysteretic deperms and to provide a useful analysis of the anhysteretic processes in the Flash-D procedure. Using a Preisach analysis of hysteresis, a mathematical description of bulk magnetic changes that occur to a specific object, within a deperm, has been developed. Theoretical calculations of PLM in a steel tube during and after both types of deperm are in excellent agreement with experimental data. The same theoretical approach was also used to retrospectively model PLM results from previous Flash-D deperms on a submarine with equal success. With this analysis it is proposed that anhysteretic deperm outcomes could be predicted a priori. The influence of magnetic cargo on hull magnetisation was demonstrated to be of significance during and after deperming. &amp;quotSympathetic deperming&amp;quot occurs where a magnetic source is located close to the hull during a deperm. It was found that a vessel or model vessel hull could still be demagnetised even when they contain magnetic cargo that would normally resist the direct application of the same magnetic fields. This was explained using the principles of demagnetising fields and anhysteretic magnetisation. A possible explanation was provided for a PVM measurement anomaly common to the model and vessel deperm results. From measurement, alternating longitudinal applied fields apparently induce corresponding changes in the PVM. This effect could be explained by the depermed object being offset longitudinally from the position expected by the measurement system. This offset could be estimated using an analysis of the changes to PLM and PVM after a longitudinal applied field. The offset displacements calculated for the vessels were too small to be verified experimentally (&amp;gt 0.1m), but the predicted offset for the steel tubes coincided with the limit of precision for their placement in the laboratory MTF = 0.5mm The aim of this work was to look at the deperm process with reference to a system that demonstrated qualitative similarities to deperms on actual vessels. The laboratory MTF is a unique facility, permitting a useful practical analysis of deperming based on sound magnetostatic measurements The experimental and theoretical results gained here have direct application to future deperms on naval vessels with particular reference to submarines.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Degaussing</field><field name="subject">Electromagnetic devices</field><field name="subject">Magnetism of ships</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The state, local communities and women : a study of women???s organisations in Malang, East Java.</field><field name="creator">Martin, Kirsty, School of Sociology, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is an ethnographic study of five women???s organisations in Malang, Indonesia. The contemporary significance of local women???s organisations in the lives of kampung women in Indonesia is revealed through an investigation of the relationship between the Indonesian state, local communities and women. This study sets contemporary women???s organisations in the context of their changing historical role and relationship with the state. Women???s organisations have been a part of the Indonesian political and social landscape since the early twentieth century. They played an important role in mobilising women during the struggle for independence. Under Sukarno???s policy of Guided Democracy, restrictions were placed on the political mobilising role of all organisations, including those for women. These restrictions were taken much further under Suharto???s New Order government when many were proscribed. Only state-approved and controlled organisations were accepted. The New Order era essentially undermined the credibility of women???s organisations as vehicles for promoting women???s interests, instead they were generally regarded as ???tools of the state???. Indonesianists and feminists have been especially critical of state-run women???s organisations arguing they have offered Indonesian women ???no path to female power???. This perception of state-sponsored women???s organisations has continued in the post-Suharto era even though their links to the state have changed radically. They now exist alongside a range of NGOs, religious and social women???s organisations. The crucial question that this thesis addresses is why these state-sponsored organisations continue to exist and what motivates women???s participation in these organisations? Through membership in local women???s organisations women enter into a complex relationship with the state, local society and the socio-religious and political institutions within the wider society. The membership status women enjoy provides them with opportunities to engage in a social bargain. Through this bargaining process, local women make social, religious, personal and romantic gains for themselves. The results of the social bargaining process depend largely on the particular organisation to which women belong but they remain strongly oriented towards their local kampung worlds. The thesis provides an alternative way of thinking about the complex role that women???s organisations play in Indonesian society and what function they may continue to have within Indonesia???s post-Suharto future.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Societies and clubs</field><field name="subject">Politics and government</field><field name="subject">1966-</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Benign anorectal disorders</field><field name="creator">Thornton, Michelle J., St George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Problem Investigated: A multitude of benign disorders affect the anorectal complex often resulting in significant morbidity. For many of these conditions the pathophysiology and clinical management continue to be debated. This is particularly so for anal fissures, anal incontinence and pelvic floor dysfunction. Procedures Followed: A series of clinical trials was performed. Anal Fissure: Two current management regimes for chronic anal fissure, Glyceryl Trinitrate and Botulinum Toxin, were prospectively assessed for manometric and clinical outcome. A new treatment regime, inducible nitric oxide, was prospectively assessed in an animal model and a new manometric observation in anal fissure patients, the Fast Wave, was validated. Anal Incontinence: The magnitude of the problem and the relative role of several previously identified risk factors was assessed from a manometric data-base. The impact of a standard treatment for Crohn???s disease, the seton, on anal continence was assessed via a retrospective cohort study. The long-term outcome of dynamic graciloplasty and re-do anal sphincter repair, two previously accepted treatments for anal incontinence, were also assessed retrospectively. A new intervention for treating anal incontinence, the magnetic ???Chair???, was prospectively trialed in incontinent patients. Pelvic Floor Dysfunction: A new treatment option for rectocoele, the laparoscopic repair, was compared with an accepted treatment option, the transanal repair via a matched cohort study. A further group of patients with multiple symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction undergoing the same laparoscopic technique were then prospectively assessed for functional outcome across the pelvic floor compartments. General Results: Anal Fissure; The manometric effects of both glyceryl trinitrate and botulinum toxin, demonstrated in this thesis would imply that their mode of impact on the anal sphincter is other than that of anal pressure reduction. Fissure healing is dependent upon the pre-treatment anal resting pressure and fissure grade, not anal pressures following treatment. Inducible nitric oxide does not increase nitrate levels in the rat internal anal sphincter. A new manometric wave form in the hypertonic internal anal sphincter, the Fast Wave, has been validated. Faecal Incontinence; Faecal incontinence is multi-factorial. However, obstetric birth injuries are the most significant factor predisposing to faecal incontinence following age. Furthermore current government policies are failing to address the problem. The dynamic graciloplasty provides symptomatic long-term relief in only 16 percent of patients and results in significant co-morbidity in most patients. Re-do anal sphincter repair provides relief in 60 percent of patients without further side effects. The use of a seton in Crohn???s perianal disease prevents deterioration of patient continence. Extracorporeal magnetic stimulation, the Chair, may provide significant relief for patients with faecal incontinence. Pelvic Floor Dysfunction: The laparoscopic posterior compartment repair provides relief of bowel symptoms in 31 percent of patients. This does not compare favourably with the transanal long-term symptomatic improvement of 67 percent. The results of the laparoscopic pelvic floor repair in patients with multiple symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction is disappointing, particularly for bowel and bladder symptom improvement. Major Conclusions: This thesis questions the accepted pathophysiology of anal fissure, highlights the long-term implications of obstetric childbirth injuries on faecal continence and raises concerns about current management strategies for faecal incontinence and pelvic floor dysfunction.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">defecation disorders</field><field name="subject">anus</field><field name="subject">rectum</field><field name="subject">diseases.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oral squamous carcinoma</field><field name="creator">Ktenas, Paul</field><field name="description">Master of Dental Surgery</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mouth -- Cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Orthodontic and biological considerations of deglutition, oro-linguo-facial muscle function, and tongue thrust : diagnosis</field><field name="creator">Kift, Russell J</field><field name="description">Master of Dental Surgery</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Deglutition</field><field name="subject">Tongue thrust</field><field name="subject">Orthodontics, Corrective</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The discourse of being a business executive: an exploration of executive coaching advertisements to illuminate the discourse of being a business executive and the degree to which executive coaching engages in psychotherapy : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master in Management, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Liu, Yun</field><field name="description">There has been growing interest in the field of business management in developing methods to improve management competency. One popular management development method has been executive coaching, but because of the unique needs of business executives, executive coaches are constantly looking for new and more effective methods to work with business executives&#8217; life, career, physical, and psychological problems. There has not been an agreed upon solution discovered to solve this problem. On the one hand, it was proposed that there is a need for executive coaches to employ psychotherapeutic methods in coaching to meet the psychological demands of business executives. But on the other hand, there are numerous issues related to standardizing executive coaching methods, qualifying executive coaches, and resolving ethical dilemmas. The author of this thesis views this issue as an over expectation of society of individuals in positions of power and responsibility. This thesis uses social theories to explore the expectations behind the high demands on the performance of business executives, and to illuminate the degree to which executive coaching engages psychotherapy. The findings of this study show that certain themes such as business skills, leadership, self-development, success, interpersonal skills, and achieve work-life balance dominates the advertisements of executive coaching professionals. These advertisements also use rhetorical devices to make these skills seem attractive and important to possess, which inevitably impacts on the view of self of executives and stimulates their desire to self- improve. It was also found that 21.26% of the advertised executive coaching services could be promoted by psychotherapists instead.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">management development</field><field name="subject">executive coaching</field><field name="subject">management performance</field><field name="subject">psychotherapy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/964</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterising the nature of postcancer fatigue in women treated for early-stage breast cancer</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Barbara Kaye, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The problem investigated Four studies investigated the phenomenon of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in women who had received adjuvant treatment for early-stage breast cancer, with a view to reducing the diagnostic uncertainty surrounding the syndrome and thus facilitating progress in both clinical management and aetiological research. Procedures and results A cross-sectional study of 109 women compared a ???cancer-specific??? self-report questionnaire (FACT-F) (canvassing fatigue symptoms) and a more generic questionnaire (SPHERE) (identifying depression and fatigue). Thirty-seven percent of women reported fatigue. Overall in 20%, fatigue was associated with psychological distress. Seventeen percent of women had fatigue but no depression. A qualitative study utilised focus groups to identify and compare the distinctive features of CRF with those of women with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). A similar set of symptoms was found in both groups, including overwhelming fatigue, un-refreshing sleep and subjective concentration problems. However, women with CFS also reported myalgia and arthralgia. Using the Structured Clinical Interview for Neurasthenia- SCIN, the third study compared the symptoms of three groups of women with fatigue: those with CRF, CFS or major depression. The detailed ???interviewer guide??? provided explicit directions for evaluating and classifying symptoms. This study confirmed the core symptom of ???profound fatigue unrelieved by rest???, and additional features that distinguished between the clinical diagnoses. The fourth study compared features of the evolution of clinically-identified fatigue syndromes in women from two prospective cohort studies; women with post-cancer fatigue (PCF) and women with post-infective fatigue syndrome (PIFS). Major conclusions A syndrome of PCF, present at least six months following adjuvant treatment and unexplained by medical or psychiatric disorder was investigated. The characteristics of PCF and those of CFS are very similar, with the fatigue state having indistinguishable descriptors. Longitudinal evaluation of the symptom complexes of PCF and PIFS suggests divergent pathways may be relevant. Co-morbid features like sleep disturbance; physical deconditioning and mood disturbance may be implicated as factors in the evolution and prolongation of PCF. These studies provide a basis for a more uniform and rigorous classification system - a necessary first step towards advancing the field both in investigating aetiology and new intervention strategies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast -- cancer; Cancer -- adjuvant treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The diverse organisation : operational considerations for managing organisational information resources</field><field name="creator">Dowse, Andrew, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sharing and exploitation of information resources across a diverse organisation can confer a significant competitive advantage but also can be a substantial challenge in coordinating across structural and specialisation boundaries. This challenge reflects the difficulties traditionally associated with lateral relations, which were recognised by classical organisational theorists but are more pronounced with the emergence of information as a critical resource. Notwithstanding the benefits of information sharing across the organisation, the classical concept of specialisation remains fundamental to organisational theory; thus there is potential for friction between requirements for specialisation and coordination. This research therefore examines information management arrangements to balance specialisation and coordination in a diverse organisation.  The research takes advantage of organisational and systems theory literature to appreciate complex information management requirements in terms of differentiation/cohesion and integration/coupling of organisational elements. Information management???s business and technology perspectives define the conceptual framework, within which gaps in the literature are identified and become the focus of the research. The two key research areas are the opportunities enabled by technology for business integration through collaborative decision-making and the management of organisation-wide information technology infrastructure. Collaborative decision-making is an integrating mechanism that can provide balance between specialisation and coordination contingent upon the nature of decision tasks and their organisational context. Propositions associated with an adaptive approach to collaborative decision-making were tested in laboratory experiments, with positive support for the contingency model albeit constrained by individual cognitive variances.  Organisations increasingly are adopting centralised approaches to the provision of IT services, with IT governance as an integrating mechanism and a need for multiple business-IT alignments to add value according to the differentiation required by organisational elements. Propositions relating to the adaptation of IT management arrangements based upon organisational characteristics were tested using a multi- iv -discipline approach, which resulted in support for the model although practical difficulties were experienced in the action research component.  This research provides a framework for maintaining effective variety of information capabilities commensurate with the diverse organisation???s mission and environment, while also exploiting the synergies and economies of shared information resources for holistic benefits.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information resources management</field><field name="subject">information technology management</field><field name="subject">systems theory</field><field name="subject">collaborative decision making</field><field name="subject">ommunication</field><field name="subject">organizations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental change detection in relation to landslide hazard using landsat TM imagery</field><field name="creator">Lau, Wing Yip, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Landslides are severe environmental hazards in mountainous areas. Nowadays, the threat of landslides to public safety has become more pronounced resulting from the burgeoning development and the increase of deforestation in hilly areas, and the increase of regional precipitation caused by global climate change. Traditional landslide risk assessment requires immense physical power to assemble different in-situ data, such as identification of landslide location and land-cover classification. This traditional data collection technique is very time consuming, and thus impossible to be applied for the large scale assessment. Remote sensing techniques, therefore, are the solutions for providing fast and up-to-date landslide assessments. This thesis focuses on the applications of multispectral Landsat data for landslide recognition. Wollongong of Australia was chosen as a test bed for this analysis. For landslide recognition analysis, three change detection techniques were employed, which were image differencing, bi-temporal linear data transformation and post-classification comparison. For the first two change detection methods, a new landslide identification procedure was developed by integrating surface change information of greenness, brightness and wetness. During the image differencing, the three surface change components were derived from Vegetation Indices (VIs), in which four different surface change composites were generated. Each composite contained three surface change bands which were greenness, brightness and wetness. For bi-temporal linear data transformation, multitemporal Kauth-Thomas (MKT) transformation was adopted for providing the three types of surface change information. In the landslide recognition analysis, the best mapping performance is yielded by the image differencing method using brightness and wetness components of Kauth-Thomas transformation and NDVI. Its omission error (i.e. percentage of actual landslide pixels which were not detected) and commission error (i.e. percentage of change pixels identified which were not landslide) are 14.4% and 3.3%, respectively, with a strong agreement (KHAT = 88.8%).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression of human emotion as an aspect of timelessness in single figure painting</field><field name="creator">Grace, Mauree, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This MFA project aims to express a particular range of emotions in an attempt to convey a sense of timelessness through a series of single figure paintings done from life.

The first series of experiments (Chapter 2) used a within-subject one-trial blocking design to study whether opioid receptors mediate a direct action of predictive error on Pavlovian association formation. Systemic administrations of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone or intra-vlPAG administrations of the selective &#956;-opioid receptor antagonist CTAP prior to Stage II training prevented one-trial blocking. These results show for the first time that opioid receptors mediate the direct actions of predictive error on Pavlovian association formation. The second series of experiments (Chapter 3) then studied temporal-difference prediction errors during Pavlovian fear conditioning. In Stage I rats received CSA ?? shock pairings. In Stage II they received CSA/CSB ?? shock pairings that blocked learning to CSB. In Stage III, a serial overlapping compound, CSB &#8594; CSA, was followed by shock. The change in intra-trial durations supported fear learning to CSB but reduced fear of CSA, revealing the selective operation of temporal-difference prediction errors. This bi-directional change in responding was prevented by systemic NMDA receptor antagonism prior to Stage III training. In contrast opioid receptor antagonism differentially affected the learning taking place during Stage III, enhancing learning to CSB while impairing the loss of fear to CSA. The final series of experiments (Chapter 4) then examined potential neuroanatomical loci for the systemic effects reported in Chapter 3. It was observed that intra-BLA infusion of ifenprodil, an antagonist of NMDA receptors containing the NR2B subunit, prevented all learning during Stage III, whereas intra-vlPAG infusion of the &#956;-opioid receptor antagonist CTAP facilitated learning to CSB but impaired learning to CSA. These results are consistent with the suggestion that opioid receptors in the vlPAG provide an important contribution to learning. Importantly, this contribution of the vlPAG is over and above its role in producing the freezing conditioned response. Furthermore, the findings of this thesis identify complementary but dissociable roles for amygdala NMDA receptors and vlPAG &#956;-opioid receptors in predictive fear learning.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">prediction</field><field name="subject">fear</field><field name="subject">blocking</field><field name="subject">opioid</field><field name="subject">PAG</field><field name="subject">NMDA</field><field name="subject">BLA</field><field name="subject">temporal-difference</field><field name="subject">rat</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43546</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A methodology for the design of educational computer adventure games</field><field name="creator">Moser, Robert B., Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work undertakes a systematic study of various elements from differing fields which apply to the construction of computer-aided instructional systems. Drawing upon these works, the potential for instruction in computer adventure games is recognised, and previous work in the area analysed with respect to the theoretical findings. Based both on this theory and the germane advice of practicing game designers, a methodology for the design of educational computer adventure games is laid out in detail. The method described is then used to construct a sample game with basic programming skills as the pedagogical content, and this sample game is tested and the results examined.  An informed approach to the design of computer-assisted instruction must begin with an understanding of how people acquire and store new information or skills. Cognitive psychology provides a number of conflicting models of the human information processing system, but these differing theories have a common basis which can be exploited in an attempt to make material more accessible. Instructional design describes a methodology for the analysis of pedagogical goals and demonstrates methods of learning support which can and should be incorporated into the new setting. In this field also is a judgement of different media, including computers, and their ability to provide the necessary elements of learning. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the medium the limits of what is possible within it can be catered to, and its failings augmented with supplemental materials. Both educational psychology and instructional design indicate benefits to learning from a correctly motivated learner, and the theory of engagement is therefore also scrutinised for elements helpful to the educational designer.  The convergence of the knowledge gleaned from these various fields leads to one possible match to the desired criteria for computer-mediated instruction; the computerised fantasy adventure game. This being the case, other work in the field is examined for relevance, and it is found that a detailed methodology for the construction of such games does not exist. Existing material is combined with the aforementioned theoretical work and a survey of what is known about practical game design to create such a framework. It is proposed that through its use the systematic inclusion of educational content in an engaging environment will be facilitated.  The hypothesis is examined, and an action research approach found to be called for. As such, the proposed methodology is used to create a sample game, and the process of its design used to inform the proposed methodology. The final form is described in detail, and the process of its application to the sample game elucidated. A prototype of the game is used with a number of test subjects to evaluate the game?s level of success at both engagement and the imparting of content material.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer adventure games</field><field name="subject">educational games</field><field name="subject">computer games</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="subject">programming</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal erasure protection assignment for scalably compressed data over packet-based networks</field><field name="creator">Thie, Johnson, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research is concerned with the reliable delivery of scalable compressed data over lossy communication channels. Recent works proposed several strategies for assigning optimal code redundancies to elements of scalable data, which form a linear structure of dependency, under the assumption that all source elements are encoded onto a common group of network packets. Given large data and small network packets, such schemes require very long channel codes with high computational complexity. In networks with high loss, small packets are more desirable than long packets.    The first contribution of this thesis is to propose a strategy for optimally assigning elements of the scalable data to clusters of packets, subject to constraints on packet size and code complexity. Given a packet cluster arrangement, the scheme then assigns optimal code redundancies to the source elements, subject to a constraint on transmission length. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy can outperform the previous code assignment schemes subject to the above-mentioned constraints, particularly at high channel loss rates.    Secondly, we modify these schemes to accommodate complex structures of dependency. Source elements are allocated to clusters of packets according to their dependency structure, subject to constraints on packet size and channel codeword length. Given a packet cluster arrangement, the proposed schemes assign optimal code redundancies to the source elements, subject to a constraint on transmission length. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed strategies for correctly modelling the dependency structure.    The last contribution of this thesis is to propose a scheme for optimizing protection of scalable data where limited retransmission is possible. Previous work assumed that retransmission is not possible. For most real-time or interactive applications, however, retransmission of lost data may be possible up to some limit. In the present work we restrict our attention to streaming sources (e.g., video) where each source element can be transmitted in one or both of two time slots. An optimization algorithm determines the transmission and level of protection for each source element, using information about the success of earlier transmissions. Experimental results confirm the benefit of limited retransmission.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PET</field><field name="subject">scalable</field><field name="subject">video</field><field name="subject">image</field><field name="subject">UEP</field><field name="subject">retransmission</field><field name="subject">erasure channel</field><field name="subject">Reed-Solomon codes</field><field name="subject">joint source channel coding</field><field name="subject">packet network</field><field name="subject">optimization</field><field name="subject">Text processing (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Packet switching (Data transmission)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19373</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional regulation of one-carbon metabolism genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae</field><field name="creator">Hong, Seung-Pyo, School of Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Genetics, UNSW</field><field name="description">The glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC) of Succharomyces cerevisiae composed of four subunits (P, H, T and L) and plays an important role in the interconversion of serine and glycine and balancing the one-carbon unit requirements of the cell. It also enables the cell to use glycine as sole nitrogen source. This study was concerned with characterising the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the GCVgenes encoding the subunits of the GDC. The important findings of this work can be summarised as follows: i) Transcription of the GCV genes are regulated by glycine and rich nitrogen sources, which are mediated by different cis-acting elements. The LPDl gene did not show a glycine response since its transcriptional regulation is distinct from that of the other genes encoding the GDC subunits. ii) Glycine analogues or serine did not affect expression of GCV2, and therefore glycine probably needs to be metabolised to effect the glycine response of the GCV genes. iii) The repression of the GCV2 gene expression by rich nitrogen sources is mediated by a sequence between -227 and -205 of GCV2, and NCR-regulatory mutant studies showed that repression is not directly controlled by the known NCR system. iv) The glycine response of GCV2 is mediated by a motif (the glycine regulatory region; GRR; 5'-CATCN7CTTCTT-3') with CTTCTT at its core. Additional sequence immediately 5' of this motif (between -310 to -289) plays a minor role for the gene's full glycine response. v) The GRR of the GCV genes can mediate the glycine response by either activation or repression, indicating that the transcription factor(s) mediating the glycine response is/are dual-functional in nature. vi) Studies of GCV2 gene expression using different regulatory mutants showed that expression of the gene is further modulated by other transcription factors such as and Baslp which are distinct from the glycine response and possibly involved in setting up the basal expression level.   vii) I n vitro studies of the GRR-protein interaction revealed THF affects the affinity of the DNA-binding protein(s) for the GRR. The importance of THF in regulation of the GCV2 gene was also shown in vivo using a foll mutant that is unable to synthesise any folates. THF or a C1-bound derivative of it acts as a ligand for the transcription factor, thus influencing transcription of the GCV genes in the appropriate physiological manner. viii) Using heparin-Sepharose chromatography fractions, four complex formations (complex I to IV) were observed with the GRR. The protein responsible for one of these was separable from the others. EMSA profiles using the GRR of the GCVI and GCV2 genes (in the presence or absence of THF) were very similar, indicating that these genes bind the same proteins and are regulated in a similar manner. ix) Mutation of the CTTCTT motif within the GRR caused significant reduction in in vitro DNA-protein complex formation, however, THF addition overcame this reduction. x) Only complex II formation was observed with a DNA fragment spanning -322 to -295, and THF affected this complex formation. xi) Footprinting analyses of complex I revealed that the binding protein protected the GRR of the GCV2 gene from DNaseI activity. This protein is an excellent candidate for the glycine response regulatory protein. Titration experiments using EMSA showed that this protein can dimerise. A preliminary genome-wide analysis of the S. cerevisiae transcriptome was carried out using miniarray membrane hybridisation. This investigated the global transcriptional changes within the cell in response to the addition of glycine into the medium. Identification of genes related to various cellular processes including onecarbon metabolism gave an insight into the regulation of the cellular metabolic flow, especially that of one-carbon metabolism. The results indicated that: xii) Glycine is transported into mitochondria to be used as substrate for the GDC which (with mitochondria1 SHMT) produces serine that is subsequently utilised for the various one-carbon metabolic pathways, such as methionine synthesis and purine synthesis.   xiii) A gene of unknown function (YER183C) which showed homology to the gene for human 5,lO-CH-THF synthetase was identified from gene-array analysis to be upregulated on glycine addition, indicating the protein encoded by this gene may be involved in balancing the metabolic flow between methionine and purine synthesis when THF pools are disturbed by glycine addition. xiv) Addition of glycine to the medium also triggers the expression of other metabolic genes related to amino acid biosynthetic pathways and that of many other genes which are not directly related to one-carbon metabolism. This may be due to prolonged culturing with glycine in the medium resulting in altered expression of genes mediated by one or more secondary factors. These may reflect an adaptive response rather than a direct consequence of glycine induction. On the basis of the above data, a model for the mechanisms regulating glycine response is presented.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetic transcription</field><field name="subject">genetic regulation</field><field name="subject">Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic impact assessment of carbon pricing of embodied greenhouse gas emissions for commercial office construction</field><field name="creator">Noller, Caroline J, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">A life cycle study was undertaken to assess the economic impact arising from internalised embodied greenhouse gas emissions (GGE) costs for a commercial office building. A limited range of design and materials re-cycling strategies were investigated for their abatement potential. GGE quantities were determined by a hybrid process analysis where input-output data was supplemented with national average data to increase completeness whereby all upstream emissions arising from material inputs to the point of extraction, as well as non-material inputs (e.g. goods and services) into the design and construction process are accounted for. The hypothesis proposed abatement potential of 30%, as measured against the Benchmark Design (BM) would be economically viable in absence of the benefit of early-action credits. The hypothesis was disproved with 15% abatement shown at zero additional capital cost. A Stretch Technology (ST) scenario was investigated which showed 32% abatement potential however the associated marginal capital cost could not be determined. The GGE intensity per meter square of Net Lettable Area (m2 NLA) for the case study building was found to be 5,258 kg CO2-e. The theoretical value of abatement credits was determined at $12 to $1,031 / m2 NLA (depending on price) and is shown to present a reasonable economic and market transformation opportunity at medium range values. The results demonstrate that the cost-push inflation risk posed to commercial office construction is large where the price of embodied GGE is internalised in the economic system. Gross Construction Cost (GCC) increase per square meter is shown to be between 1.5% and 61% (with associated negative IRR impacts between -0.1 to -7%) depending on the GGE price level. An unsustainable cost impact is demonstrated at GGE prices greater than AUD$50 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (AUD$50/ tonne CO2-e).  Internalised GGE studies have been largely limited to the operational cost impact arising from GGE of direct end-use rather than from the perspective of total embodied final demand. The results demonstrate the critical nature of embodied abatement strategies for commercial buildings if the internationally accepted 60% global GGE abatement is to be achieved within the relevant timeframe. An average kg CO2-e intensity per dollar of GCC is proposed for the three building models that may be applied to general scenario planning. The scale of economic benefit available for embodied credits is significant and the determination of viable credit mechanisms worthy of further research.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Life cycle costing</field><field name="subject">greenhouse gases</field><field name="subject">office buildings</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22991</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural evolution of environment and economy in Australia</field><field name="creator">Wood, Richard</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">structural change</field><field name="subject">input-output analysis</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">International Japanese students: their expectations and learning needs at Australian universities.</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Pauline</field><field name="description">International Japanese Students: Their Expectations and Learning Needs at Australian Universities International full fee paying students make a sizable economic contribution to the Australian economy and the universities at which they enroll. Considerable competition for these students from the UK and USA indicates the necessity of meeting their needs if the Australian higher education market is to be preserved. Recent research has challenged the effectiveness of the currently operating Australian marketisation model that focuses upon attracting students and maximizing profits. International students, and specifically Japanese students who were the focus of this research, are attracted to Australian university studies for a number of reasons which are analyzed. The numbers of Japanese students studying at Australian universities have fallen since 2006, despite Japan being potentially one of the largest international markets. The learning needs and expectations of 51 Japanese undergraduate and postgraduate students at two Sydney universities were analyzed using a questionnaire and semi-structured interview during their first semester of enrollment. The expectations and needs of these students had been shaped by growing up and being educated in Japan, a culture that values university education in different ways to Australia, and has different views on learning and study. Analyses of Australian academic culture, that emphasizes individuality and critical thinking, together with analyses of Japanese values and cultural mores, provided the foundations to guide the study and help formulate the questions used to gather data. Results revealed a considerable proportion of respondents were postgraduates contrary to the expectation that the market is chiefly an undergraduate one. It was found that only approximately thirty per cent of students had come to Australia for primarily educational reasons. The other seventy per cent had been attracted to Australia the country and its culture, and had been motivated for personal development reasons and to satisfy challenges pertaining, in some cases, to English language acquisition. These findings reflect earlier research based on ESL classes. The majority appear to have been motivated by liberal education reasons, with explanation of the process engaged in, with so little serious preparation, perhaps best accounted for in terms of Hart&#8217;s (1999) work on the hero&#8217;s personal journey with its substantial challenges. Results indicated that a considerable number of students at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels experienced difficulties with a number of basic academic skills expected at Australian universities. These included listening to and understanding lectures, note taking in lectures, reading for assignments, writing assignments, discussing studies with Australian students, and group work activities generally that required public presentation and argument. The majority had done little reading or other preparation for their educational adventure in a foreign Australian culture, although many were aware of the fact that their undertaking would be hard, having spoken to other Japanese students. Relatively few appeared to have been influenced by family members who had undertaken international study. All had been admitted on the basis of IELTS or TOEFL standards set by the universities, but had studied English in preparation for their international studies for relatively short periods of time, with this apparently contributing to their problems with Australian academic skills. Findings indicate that most of these students continued to frame their intercultural experience in terms of the Japanese cultural scenario, leading in many cases to academic and socio-cultural expectations at odds with Australian university expectations of the roles these students should play. Specific recommendations are made regarding the need for university policies to ensure that Japanese students are made aware of academic and socio-cultural differences and challenges before enrollment, and are offered programs that will develop specific academic skills. The analyses of the culturally-based academic learning difficulties encountered by students in this research should provide a substantial guide for specific skill development programs. Some of the expectations, that would be appropriate in the Japanese cultural setting, cannot be accommodated in the Australian one, and need to be managed prior to enrollment. On the wider policy level, there is also a serious need to reconsider the standards of English required for admission. Recommendations are made for a larger scale, longitudinal study to be undertaken to address issues that could not be considered in what was essentially an exploratory study. The analyses of Japanese cultural values and social expectations, presented as part of this research, would appear to offer a substantial basis to assist institutions and staff to better understand Japanese students and their learning needs in the Australian academic cultural context, and to guide both research and teaching. In policy terms, results indicate that there is a clear need to reconsider the marketisation model and spend more on support services for the students who have paid full fees. Results also indicate that the policies advanced by government policy makers linking tourism and university study are relatively na&#239;ve, and cannot succeed without better understanding of the needs and expectations of international students from different cultural backgrounds, and better support services carefully tailored to their needs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese students.</field><field name="subject">International students.</field><field name="subject">Fee paying students.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/846</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Opening a dialogical space between Buddhism and economics : the relationship between insight and action</field><field name="creator">Bubna-Litic, David C.</field><field name="description">This interdisciplinary study explores the dialogical space between Buddhism and economics grounded upon an empirical examination of the lived experience of western Buddhist teachers. The goal of Buddhist practice is enlightenment, a powerfully liberating and transformative understanding in which the ordinary sense of self is extinguished. There is a variety of claims made by Buddhist traditions regarding enlightenment, and little agreement as to its exact nature; most Buddhist traditions, however, regard the self as having no essential basis. This view contrasts sharply with those of contemporary economic thought. Modern economic thinking has generally seen Buddhism as one of many religions, and has resisted taking its claims seriously. At the heart of this divide lies a hermeneutic barrier that is not simply between East and West, but has its roots in modernity, which maintains a separation of humans from nature, a distinction between knowledge and power, and a distrust of human subjective experience. By engaging in a dialogical approach, this study attempts to bridge this divide. It builds on experiential corroboration of Buddhist conceptions of self, based on semi-structured interviews of 34 western Buddhist teachers, to critically examine their experiences of insight into the nature of self, its impact on their relationships with others and nature, and its impact on their decisions about everyday economic activities. The purpose is twofold: to examine the nature of realisation experientially and to explore its transformative potential with a view to unfolding implications for economic action. The findings clarify many traditional Buddhist understandings, challenge and validate previous interpretations, and suggest an embodied rather than transcendent view of consciousness and spirituality. The implications for economic thought include a new conception of the economic individual (homooeconomicus), recognising the old conception as based on a misplaced idea of concreteness of self; a new epistemology which incorporates a phenomenological appreciation of life; and a new perspective of agency as the mindful embodiment of a seamless interconnection between consciousness and the social and natural world.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Buddhism</field><field name="subject">economic aspects</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">economics</field><field name="subject">religious aspects</field><field name="subject">Dharma (Buddhism)</field><field name="subject">Zen Buddhism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/39749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Construction methods for vertex magic total labelings of graphs</field><field name="creator">Gray, Ian</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vertex magic</field><field name="subject">graph labelings</field><field name="subject">sparse magic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/34369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Profile-guided redundancy elimination</field><field name="creator">Cai, Qiong, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Program optimizations analyze and transform the programs such that better performance results can be achieved. Classical optimizations mainly use the static properties of the programs to analyze program code and make sure that the optimizations work for every possible combination of the program and the input data. This approach is conservative in those cases when the programs show the same runtime behaviors for most of their execution time. On the other hand, profile-guided optimizations use runtime profiling information to discover the aforementioned common behaviors of the programs and explore more optimization opportunities, which are missed in the classical, non-profile-guided optimizations. Redundancy elimination is one of the most powerful optimizations in compilers. In this thesis, a new partial redundancy elimination (PRE) algorithm and a partial dead code elimination algorithm (PDE) are proposed for a profile-guided redundancy elimination framework. During the design and implementation of the algorithms, we address three critical issues: optimality, feasibility and profitability. First, we prove that both our speculative PRE algorithm and our region-based PDE algorithm are optimal for given edge profiling information. The total number of dynamic occurrences of redundant expressions or dead codes cannot be further eliminated by any other code motion. Moreover, our speculative PRE algorithm is lifetime optimal, which means that the lifetimes of new introduced temporary variables are minimized. Second, we show that both algorithms are practical and can be efficiently implemented in production compilers. For SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks, the average compilation overhead for our PRE algorithm is 3%, and the average overhead for our PDE algorithm is less than 2%. Moreover, edge profiling rather than expensive path profiling is sufficient to guarantee the optimality of the algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed profile-guided redundancy elimination techniques can provide speedups on real machines by conducting a thorough performance evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first performance evaluation of the profile-guided redundancy elimination techniques on real machines.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Compilers (Computer programs)</field><field name="subject">System programming (Computer science)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate risk management with reinsurance and derivatives : panel data methodology and new results from empirical studies using Australian data</field><field name="creator">Carneiro, Luiz Augusto Ferreira, Actuarial Studies, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis contributes to the issue of why corporations manage risk with insurance and financial derivative contracts. Two different empirical studies are done with data sets from Australian companies: 1) one study on reinsurance demand; and 2) one study on interest-rate-risk hedging demand from non-banking companies listed at the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). Both studies use panel data models. A Monte Carlo simulation replicates the basic characteristics of the original data sets and allows a performance comparison among different panel data models. This thesis provides the first empirical work on insurer demand for reinsurance using Australian data. A panel-data set (1996-2001) is used, which provides 543 observations. The study finds strong evidence that larger insurers, insurers member of a group of companies, reinsurers, and captive insurers reinsure more. The impacts of leverage, taxes, and return on investments are not statistically significant. The second empirical study analyses the interest-rate-risk hedging demand with two panel data sets from 1998 to 2003 (1134 and 465 observations, respectively). Detailed information about interest-rate-risk exposures was available after manual data collection from financial reports, which was only possible due to specific reporting requirements in Australian accounting standards. A probit regression analysis confirms previous empirical results that company size is important to the decision to hedge interest rate risk in Australia. However, in relation to the analysis of the extent of hedging, the proper measurement of interest-rate-risk exposures generates some significant results different from those found in previous studies. For example, this study shows that total leverage (total debt ratio) is not significantly important to interest-rate-risk hedging demand and that, instead, this demand is related to the specific risk exposure in the interest bearing part of debt. This study finds significant relations of interest-rate-risk hedging to company size, floating-interest-rate debt ratio, annual log returns, and company industry type.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Risk management - Australia</field><field name="subject">Reinsurance</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lifetime monitoring of appliances for reuse</field><field name="creator">Mazhar, Muhammad Ilyas, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Environmental awareness and legislative pressures have made manufacturers responsible for the take-back and end-of-life treatment of their products. Therefore, manufacturers are struggling to find ways to recover maximum value from returned products. This goal can best be achieved by promoting multiple reuse programs as reuse is one of the most effective ways to enhance a sustainable engineering economy. Since the essential goal of the reuse strategy is to reuse parts, the reliability of used parts becomes a core issue. Research indicates that reuse is technologically feasible, associated with a significant manufacturing cost saving, and it does not compromise product quality. However, it is not easy to be applied in reality. There are several uncertainties associated with reuse, the most common is the uncertainty of the product???s quality after use. A widespread implementation of the reuse strategy could be triggered, subject to the availability of reliable methods to assess the useful remaining life of parts. The evolution of such a methodology would play a pivotal role in making decisions on the supply chain process and the recovery value of returned products. Reliability assessment by life cycle data analysis is the basis of this research. The proposed methodology addresses the problem of reliability assessment of used parts by considering two important aspects. It performs statistical as well as condition monitoring data analysis for decision-making on reuse. The analysis is carried out in two stages. Firstly, a wellknown reliability assessment procedure, the Weibull analysis, is applied to analyse time-tofailure data to assess the overall reuse potential of components. In the second stage, the used capacity (actual life) of components is determined by analysing their operating history (condition monitoring data). The linear and nonlinear regression analysis, Kriging procedures and artificial neural networks (ANN) are employed in this stage. Finally, the Weibull analysis and ANNs are integrated to estimate the remaining useful life of components/assemblies of a product at the end of its first life cycle. The model was validated by using life cycle data from consumer products.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Recycling (Waste, etc.)</field><field name="subject">Recycled products</field><field name="subject">Production engineering - Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Industrial management - Environmental aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25963</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stereotype threat behind the wheel</field><field name="creator">Yeung, Nai Chi, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Stereotype threat refers to the pressure that individuals feel when they are at risk of confirming a demeaning stereotype about themselves. Research has found that stereotype threat impairs performance on cognitive-based tasks by inducing mental interference (e.g., Schmader &amp; Johns, 2003). This thesis hypothesised that this finding would generalise to driving and that drivers who are better able to inhibit cognitive interference (i.e., with better inhibitory ability) would be less susceptible to the disruptive effect of stereotype threat than drivers who are less able (i.e., with poorer inhibitory ability). A series of three experiments conducted in a driving simulator tested the predictions using the gender stereotype of driving skills and investigated the interpretation of the results. The experiments revealed that stereotype threat exerted both a facilitative and debilitative influence on driving performance, as indicated by different performance measures. The facilitative effect diminished when drivers experienced increased mental demands or when they were assessed by an unexpected performance measure, while the debilitative effect was more likely observed among drivers who received negative feedback than drivers who received positive feedback. Moreover, the results supported the prediction that inhibitory ability would moderate the detrimental impact of stereotype threat as the performance of drivers with poorer inhibitory ability was impeded more than that of drivers with better inhibitory ability. Regarding the processes underlying the present findings, the experiments provided suggestive evidence that stereotype threat elicits cognitive interference and simultaneously motivates drivers to concentrate on particular performance areas in an attempt to refute the stereotype. In combination, these processes appear to be at least partly responsible for the performance deficits and boosts observed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stereotype (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Stereotypes (Social psychology)</field><field name="subject">Bahavior modification</field><field name="subject">Automobile driving - Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Performance - Evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extraction and characterisation of pectin from Australian and Indonesian sweet potato.</field><field name="creator">Nurdjanah, Siti, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Starch residue samples from two Australian sweet potato varieties (Beauregard and Northern Star) and two Indonesian sweet potato varieties (Bis192 and Bis183), and commercial sample of sweet potato starch residue, were studied for their pectins. Pectins were extracted using 0.1M HCl, 0.05M NaOH, 0.1M HCl/0.75%SHMP, and 0.05M NaOH/0.75% SHMP. Hydrolysis of residual starch in the cell wall of sweet potato using heat stable &#945;-amylase and amyloglucosidase was employed prior to pectin extraction to eliminate starch contamination. Pectins were characterised for yield, moisture, ash, galacturonic acid content (GA), degree of esterification (DE), neutral sugars content and molecular weight (MW). Selected pectins were also characterised for their dispersion and gel properties. Pectin with the highest yield was compared to commercial low methoxyl pectin (GRINSTED??YF 450) for its application in milk pudding. The pectin characteristics are dependent on variety and extraction process; however, the extraction methods were dominant. Yields were between 7 and 30 % of the cell wall. Ash varied from 2.9 to 6.8%. NaOH/SHMP extraction gave higher yields and ash contents. Moisture was between 5.5 and 6.7. GA varied from 27 to 80% with the highest found in Bis192 extracted using NaOH/SHMP. DE varied between traceable and 57%. HCl extraction gave higher DE, while NaOH/SHMP caused demethylation. Neutral sugars varied from 10 to 25% where galactose was the predominant sugar, followed by arabinose, rhamnose, glucose and xylose. Pectin MW was very heterogeneous. HCl extraction gave higher MW than the others. Dispersion of sweet potato pectins displayed shear-thinning. Consistency coefficient (K) increased, while flow behaviour index (n) decreased with increasing pectin concentration. HCl-extracted pectins formed stiff sugar-gels at concentrations higher than 2%. The optimum Ca2+ concentration for NaOH/SHMP-extracted pectin gels was 20 mg/g pectin. Pectin with the highest yield and stiffness (Norther Star extracted using NaOH containing SHMP) was used for milk pudding preparation. This pudding had comparable texture to pudding prepared from commercial low methoxyl citrus pectin (GRINSTED??YF 450). Overall, this study demonstrated that pectin from sweet potato starch residue is mainly low methoxyl pectin with possible chemical structure of rhamnogalacturonan I (RGI) that has potential for food applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pectin</field><field name="subject">Extraction (Chemistry)</field><field name="subject">Sweet potatoes -- Autralia</field><field name="subject">Sweet potatoes -- Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">???Through the looking glass ?????? from comfort and conformity to challenge and collaboration: changing parent involvement in the catholic education of their children through the twentieth century</field><field name="creator">Millar, Nance Marie, School of Sociology &amp; Anthropology, UNSW</field><field name="description">This sociological investigation examines the changing role of parents in the education of their children in Catholic schools in New South Wales over the twentieth century. Catholic Church documents specifically state primary parental responsibility for their children???s religious education. Catholic schools were established to inculcate faith, and assist parents??? role. This thesis asks, to what extent that role has been realised? It unravels the processes that determined and defined the changing role of Catholic parents during this period, and identifies significant shifts in institutional thinking and practices related to parents and resultant shifts in cultural and social perceptions. After half a century of conformity and comfort, a significant era followed as the Australian Church responded to challenges, including financial crisis for Catholic schools, reform in the Australian education system, and the impact of the Second Vatican Council. Cohorts from three generations were selected. Interviews and focus groups elicited memories that were recorded and analysed, in terms of the integral questions; the role and involvement of parents in Catholic schools. Participants recalled their own childhood in Catholic schools and, where applicable, as parents educating their own children, or as religious teachers. The analysis was theoretically informed by the work of Durkheim, Greeley, Coleman and Bourdieu. A review of Church documents and commentaries through the twentieth century, bearing on the education of children, showed the official Church position. Despite numerous rhetorical statements issued by Catholic authorities, emphasising the role of parents as ???primary educators???, the practical responses ranged from active encouragement to dismissal. Teachers in Catholic schools and related bureaucracies were, seemingly, reluctant to initiate a more inclusive partnership role. Gradually, and in a piecemeal fashion, the Catholic Church and its schools have been responding to growing parental consciousness of their role and responsibilities.  A significant shift was signalled by the New South Wales Bishops in establishing the Council of Catholic School Parents, to be supported by a full-time, salaried Executive Officer, in 2003. But any accommodation to new understandings of parent/teacher, or family/school relation is complex and not to be oversimplified as a simple sharing, or ceding of authority.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic schools -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Catholic Church -- Education -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Religious education -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Education -- Parent participation -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Parent-teacher relationships -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Home and school -- New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negotiating norms, navigating care: the practice of culturally competent care in cardiac rehabilitation</field><field name="creator">Haghshenas, Abbas, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">BACKGROUND Increasingly, it is recognised that the unique needs of people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds (CaLDB) should be addressed within a framework of cultural competence. To date, there are limited data on the issues facing CaLDB patients in the Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) setting. Appreciation of an individual???s values, attitudes and beliefs underpins negotiation of behaviour change in the CR setting. Therefore an understanding of patient and professional interactions is of key importance. OBJECTIVES The focus of this study has been to undertake an exploration of CR service delivery to people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, using Arabic speaking people as an exemplar of a CaLDB group. More broadly, this research project has sought to identify factors, which influence the practice of health professionals towards CaLDB patients, and to develop a model for evaluation of culturally competent health care in the CR setting. The study sought to achieve these aims by addressing the following research questions: 1. In what way do health practitioners in CR adjust their treatment and support to accommodate the perceived needs of CaLDB communities? 2. In what way do factors (such as individual and organisation perspectives) influence the adjustment of clinical practice and service delivery of CR practitioners; and what are practitioners??? and patients??? perception of barriers and facilitators to service delivery? 3. To what level are CaLDB patients satisfied with CR services? This study design is comprised of the following elements: (1) interviews with health practitioners and Arabic speaking background patients as an exemplar of CaLDB patients; (2) review of policy and procedure documents and medical records; and (3) field observation.  METHOD This thesis embraces a qualitative approach as the primary method of investigation to align with the exploratory and descriptive nature of the study. The main methods used in the study were: in depth interviews with health professionals and patients; field observations; appraisal of relevant documents and consultation with expert panels. Study samples were selected through a purposive sampling strategy.Data were analysed using the method of content analysis, guided by the research questions. FINDINGS In total, 25 health professionals (20 female and 5 male) and 32 patients (21 male and 11 female) were interviewed. The method of qualitative content analysis was used for data analysis. Data analysis revealed four major themes: 1) The challenging context; 2) Tuning practices; 3) Influencing factors; and 4) Goodness of fit. The study demonstrated a challenging context for CR delivery, both from the perspective of patients and health professionals. Data reveal a process of reflection, negotiation, and navigation of care by CR health professionals in an effort to understand and meet the diverse needs of CALDB patients. CONCLUSION On the basis of the study findings, a process-oriented model of tuning practice to achieve cultural competence in CR delivery is proposed to inform policy, research and clinical practice.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heart -- Diseases -- Patients -- Rehabilitation -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Health services accessibility -- Cross-cultural studies</field><field name="subject">Transcultural medical care</field><field name="subject">Heart -- Diseases -- Prevention -- Needs assessment -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selective detection in an iterative soft interference cancellation receiver</field><field name="creator">Sun, Kyung Tae (John), Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes an idea to selectively detect the code bits in an iterative soft interference cancellation multiuser receiver. It is of a great interest to reduce the complexity of the multiuser detectors in order to achieve faster multiuser communication systems. Although the suboptimum detector has much less complexity than the optimum, the detections are made on each code bit of all users through-out every iteration. Selective detection greatly reduces the amount of calculation by re-detecting only the unreliably detected code bits from the second iteration. Simulation results show that the number of detections is significantly reduced, while the performance is maintained. Necessary background information to understand the working principles of the iterative soft cancellation receiver is presented as well. Selective detection may also be used in any other receiver structures with iterative procedures to provide much less complexity. Hence, it is able to handle much more complicated receiver structures, or implement the system to a mobile device where the computational ability is much less than at the base station.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35224</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical simulation of the unsteady aerodynamics of flapping airfoils</field><field name="creator">Young, John, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">There is currently a great deal of interest within the aviation community in the design of small, slow-flying but manoeuvrable uninhabited vehicles for reconnaissance, surveillance, and search and rescue operations in urban environments. Inspired by observation of birds, insects, fish and cetaceans, flapping wings are being actively studied in the hope that they may provide greater propulsive efficiencies than propellers and rotors at low Reynolds numbers for such Micro-Air Vehicles (MAVs). Researchers have posited the Strouhal number (combining flapping frequency, amplitude and forward speed) as the parameter controlling flapping wing aerodynamics in cruising flight, although there is conflicting evidence. This thesis explores the effect of flapping frequency and amplitude on forces and wake structures, as well as physical mechanisms leading to optimum propulsive efficiency. Two-dimensional rigid airfoils are considered at Reynolds number 2,000 ??? 40,000. A compressible Navier-Stokes simulation is combined with numerical and analytical potential flow techniques to isolate and evaluate the effect of viscosity, leading and trailing edge vortex separation, and wake vortex dynamics. The wake structures of a plunging airfoil are shown to be sensitive to the flapping frequency independent of the Strouhal number. For a given frequency, the wake of the airfoil exhibits ???vortex lock-in??? as the amplitude of motion is increased, in a manner analogous to an oscillating circular cylinder. This is caused by interaction between the flapping frequency and the ???bluff-body??? vortex shedding frequency apparent even for streamlined airfoils at low Reynolds number. The thrust and propulsive efficiency of a plunging airfoil are also shown to be sensitive to the flapping frequency independent of Strouhal number. This dependence is the result of vortex shedding from the leading edge, and an interaction between the flapping frequency and the time for vortex formation, separation and convection over the airfoil surface. The observed propulsive efficiency peak for a pitching and plunging airfoil is shown to be the result of leading edge vortex shedding at low flapping frequencies (low Strouhal numbers), and high power requirements at large flapping amplitudes (high Strouhal numbers). The efficiency peak is governed by flapping frequency and amplitude separately, rather than the Strouhal number directly.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerodynamics</field><field name="subject">propulsion</field><field name="subject">propulsive</field><field name="subject">wake</field><field name="subject">thrust</field><field name="subject">drag</field><field name="subject">airfoil</field><field name="subject">motion</field><field name="subject">lift</field><field name="subject">turbulence modelling</field><field name="subject">plunging</field><field name="subject">Navier-Stokes</field><field name="subject">oscillating foils</field><field name="subject">Strouhal number</field><field name="subject">numbers</field><field name="subject">viscosity</field><field name="subject">leading edge</field><field name="subject">leading edges. trailing edge</field><field name="subject">vortex separation</field><field name="subject">flapping frequency</field><field name="subject">amplitude</field><field name="subject">wings</field><field name="subject">aerodynamic</field><field name="subject">numerical modelling</field><field name="subject">viscous flow</field><field name="subject">simulation methods</field><field name="subject">aerofoils</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changes in body image during a resistance training programme for women</field><field name="creator">Kay, Michelle, School of Sport &amp; Leisure Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">CHANGES IN BODY IMAGE DURING A RESISTANCE TRAINING PROGRAMME FOR WOMEN.

Furthermore, little attention has been directed towards investigating if body image actually changes and it is not clear if exercise plays a therapeutic or detrimental role. The aim of this study was to: a) investigate changes in perceptual and attitudinal body image and changes in body composition during an exercise training programme for women and b) examine the relationship between changes in physical measures and changes in psychological measures. The treatment group (25 females) participated in a 16 week resistance training programme. The control group (n = 12) did not undertake any exercise (above a recreational level). Anthropometric and psychometric tests were administered at 0, 8 and 16 weeks outside pre- and menstrual phases. The results obtained indicated that 1) for both exercise and control groups, there were significant decreases in skinfold thicknesses but no changes in gross measures such as mass, body mass index (BMI), chest-to-waist ratio (CWR) and waist-to-hips ratio (WHR); 2) both groups demonstrated improved size estimation accuracy, less discrepancy between the actual and self-estimated BMI, increased ideal size and a decrease in the perceptual measure of dissatisfaction; 3) both groups increased the sum of regional satisfaction scores; 4) both groups decreased dissatisfaction measured via the Body Shape Questionnaire and 5) similar to other studies, anthropometric variables explain only a small part of the variability in body image. The study demonstrates that body image, measured by a number of instruments, can change. However, improvements in body image cannot be fully explained by exercise participation or changes in body composition. It is possible that desensitisation to exposing the body during repeated measures, perceived social support of the experimenter or even seasonal factors may have contributed to such changes. Exercise is associated with many benefits but is not evident if it has a unique contribution to improved body image health. It cannot be excluded as a potential intervention but should be tailored to individual motivations.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sport Science</field><field name="subject">Body image in women</field><field name="subject">Effect of exercise on</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17789</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cerebellar synaptic plasticity in two animal models of muscular dystrophy</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Jennifer Louise, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and congenital muscular dystrophy 1A (MDC1A) are the two most common forms of muscular dystrophy in humans, caused by mutations in dystrophin and laminin &#945;2 genes respectively. Both are severe forms of the disease that lead to premature death due and are both now known to have a significant effect on the central nervous system. This project investigated the role of both proteins involved in each of these diseases in cerebellar Purkinje cells of two murine models of disease: the mdx mouse a dystrophin-deficient model of DMD and the dy2J a laminin &#945;2-deficient murine model of MDC1A. In the case of dystrophin further studies were undertaken in order to determine if increasing age had any effects on cerebellar function. It was found that there is no difference in electrophysiological characteristics (RMP, IR, eEPSP) of the cells when compared to appropriate control groups, nor was there any difference when young and aged dystrophin-deficient mdx groups were compared. Evoked IPSP characteristics were examined in young mdx cerebellar Purkinje cells and again no difference was found when compared to wildtype. There was a significant difference in response to the GABAA antagonist bicuculline, with wildtype increasing eEPSP amplitude by almost double that found in mdx. There was no difference in short term plasticity as measured by paired pulse facilitation in any of these groups. There was no difference in paired pulse depression at the inhibitory interneuron- Purkinje cell synapse of young wildtype and mdx cerebellar Purkinje cells. There a significant blunting of long term depression (LTD, (a form of long term synaptic plasticity) between young wildtype and mdx. When young wildtype animals were compared to aged wildtype animals LTD was found to be similar, when young mdx was compared to aged mdx, there was a recovery of LTD seen in the aged population. There was also significant differences in LTD found when littermate controls were compared to dy2J (laminin &#945;2 mutants). A third of the phenotypic animals (dy2J) potentiated. Finally when rebound potentiation (a GABA-ergic form of long term synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum) was compared in young wildtype and mdx mice, mdx mice displayed depression, rather than the expected potentiation in contrast to potentiation (or no change) as seen in all wildtype cells.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">laminin alpha2</field><field name="subject">muscular dystrophy</field><field name="subject">dystrophin</field><field name="subject">cerebellum</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antibacterial polyurethane nanocomposites for urinary devices</field><field name="creator">Fong, Nicole Wei Shi, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hospital-acquired infections are a significant contributor to clinically-related morbidity and mortality. The majority of these infections are associated with the use of invasive medical devices, where urinary catheters account for ~36% of cases. Current preventative strategies have shown short-term (&lt;7 days) success, however their long-term (&gt;28 days) efficacy is unclear. This thesis explores the use of solution-cast polyurethane nanocomposite (PUNC) materials for antimicrobial drug delivery in urinary applications. It is hypothesised that the enhanced barrier properties of PUNCs, afforded by the incorporation of well-dispersed nanoinclusions, would allow for the sustained release of an antimicrobial agent. The objectives of this research were to investigate the antibacterial, mechanical and barrier properties of PUNCs incorporating various silicates modified using antimicrobials, hypothesised to also act as dispersing agents. Organically modified silicates (OMS) were prepared at 110%, 200% and 300% cationic exchange capacity (CEC) using the biocide, chlorhexidine diacetate (CHX), which was hypothesised to perform the dual functions; dispersant and antibacterial agent. Resulting OMS were incorporated at 1wt% and 5wt% loadings into a PU matrix to produce PUNCs; PEU-CHX1.1MMT, PEU-CHX2.0MMT, and PEU-CHX3.0MMT, respectively. CHX performed well as a dispersant, producing intercalated to partially exfoliated PUNCS. Antibacterial activity was dependent on OMS type and loading. PEU-CHX1.1MMT materials had poor antibacterial properties, but the addition of free CHX into the materials significantly improved their efficacy, demonstrating long-term sterility in an in vitro urinary tract (UT) model. PEU-CHX2.0MMT and PEU-CHX3.0MMT at 5wt% OMS loadings had partially exfoliated structures and excellent antibacterial activity. Cytotoxicity was evident in all materials, although to a lesser extent in the latter. Overall, intermediate OMS loadings of CHX2.0MMT would be expected to produce PUNCs with favourable antibacterial activity and cytocompatibility. PUNC drug-release profiles demonstrated sustained release compared to pristine PU, indicative of enhanced barrier properties. Their ultimate tensile properties decreased with increased OMS loading or addition of free CHX.Higher cationic-exchanged OMS caused significant reductions in strain. Young's modulus increased in response to higher %CEC OMS and loading. PUNCs show promise as antibacterial biomaterials for long-term urinary applications, where antimicrobial release and mechanical properties can be modulated through organic modification and OMS loading.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antibacterial</field><field name="subject">Nanocomposite</field><field name="subject">Polyurethane</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing functional magnetic nanoparticles with flame spray pyrolysis for bio-applications</field><field name="creator">Li, Dan, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) hold great promise in the fields of biology and medicine. The synthesis of functional MNPs with precisely controlled crystallographic, physicochemical, and magnetic properties on a large scale still remains the challenge today. This thesis reports the exploration of liquid-fed flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) in the synthesis of functional MNPs, their surface modifications, and potential bio-applications. Superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic maghemite (&#947;-Fe2O3) nanoparticles, and silica-coated maghemite (SiO2/&#947;-Fe2O3) nanocomposites were synthesised using FSP. The size of &#947;-Fe2O3 was controllable from 6 to 53 nm, with morphology evolving from a disordered near-spherical shape to fully ordered 2-D hexagonal/octagonal platelet. The saturation magnetisation (Ms) increased from 21 to 74 emu/g with increasing particle size, up to 13 nm when Ms approached the bulk &#947;-Fe2O3 characteristics. In the case of SiO2/&#947;-Fe2O3, three distinct morphologies, namely the single segregated &#947;-Fe2O3 core- SiO2 shell, transitional mixed morphologies, and multi &#947;-Fe2O3 cores embedded in submicron SiO2 shell, were obtained. The core size, composite size, and morphology of &#947;- Fe2O3 were tunable by varying %SiO2 loading and the use of a quartz tube enclosure during flame synthesis. The magnetic behaviour correlated well with the crystal microstructure. Following the core particle design, protein adsorption-desorption behaviour on FSP-madeMNPs was studied. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) adsorption was found to follow the Langmuir isotherm, with high binding capacities (150&#8722;348 mg BSA/g particle) and fast association constants. Electrostatically governed BSA orientations were proposed for different particle-buffer systems. The adsorbed BSA was effectively recovered by pH-shift using K2HPO4. Subsequently, terminal amine, aldehyde, carboxylic, epoxy, mercapto and maleimide functionality were anchored onto the FSP-made &#947;-Fe2O3 particles. These versatile functional groups led to conjugation of active trypsin. The immobilised trypsin exhibited superior durability with &gt;60% residual activity after one week, and excellent reusability for &gt;5 cycles. The trypsin-conjugated MNPs are promising carriers in proteomics, demonstrating good substrate specificity with equivalent or better sequence coverage compared to free trypsin in insulin and BSA digestion. In another application, a refined silanisation procedure simultaneously reduced &#947;-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, and generated thiol enriched surface for matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) conjugation. The highly active MMP-2-conjugated MNPs could potentially enhance the interstitial transport of macromolecule/nanoparticles in drug delivery.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flame spray pyrolysis</field><field name="subject">magnetic particles</field><field name="subject">functionalisation</field><field name="subject">particle characterisation</field><field name="subject">iron oxide nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">silica coated magnetic particles</field><field name="subject">bovine serum albumin</field><field name="subject">silane</field><field name="subject">trypsin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The conservation and management of small mammals and lizards in a disturbed forest ecosystem</field><field name="creator">Penn, Angela Mary, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The conservation of biological diversity has become one of the most important goals of managing forests in an ecologically sustainable way. In this thesis, I report a comprehensive study designed to examine the long-term effects of commercial logging and high-intensity fire, and the ability of Population Viability Analysis (PVA) models to predict these effects to aid in the conservation and management of multiple species. Initially, I compared the abundance of small mammals (A. agilis, R. fuscipes, A. swainsonii), and lizards (L. delicata, L. guichenoti, E. heatwolei), in sites with different disturbance histories: 18-19 yearold logging regrowth, 28-29 or 33-34 year???old clearfelling regrowth and unlogged forest. All sites had previously been burnt by bushfires. No evidence of long-term effects of logging or fire was found for A. agilis, R. fuscipes, L. delicata or L. guichenoti, and there were not enough data to make conclusions for A. swainsonii and E. heatwolei. Then the effects of a hazard-reduction burn were investigated. There was variation between the species in the effects of the burn, with interactions between year, aspect and burning for A. agilis and R. fuscipes, and interactions between year, disturbance and topography for the Lampropholis species. A. swainsonii became extremely scarce in the forest after the burn and E. heatwolei were generally unaffected. Next, PVA metapopulation models were used to predict the likely abundance and patch occupancy of these species based on historical data. Retrospective testing showed the models were accurate for all species, but best for A. agilis and R. fuscipes. Lastly, PVA modelling was used to rank management options; no management action, a hazard-reduction burn in 2005 or a logging event in 2005. The models predicted that future management is likely to result in the extinction of A. agilis, R. fuscipes and L. guichenoti by 2010. However, no one management scenario was most detrimental to all species. The current management regime for this forest involves commercial logging on a 40-year cycle and regular hazard-reduction burning. PVA modelling predicts that A. swainsonii and L. delicata are at the greatest risk of extinction under this regime, but that it is also likely to lead to the extinction of A. agilis, R. fuscipes and L. guichenoti in the near future. The results of this research indicate that the conservation of multiple species under one management regime is unlikely to be successful.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">logging</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">mammals</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">lizards</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cyanide regeneration from Thiocyanate with the use of Anion exchange resins</field><field name="creator">Lee, Kenneth Chung-Keong, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">It is known in many gold operations that less than 2% of the cyanide consumed accounts for the gold and silver dissolution. The majority of the cyanide is consumed by minerals contained in the gold ore to produce many different cyanide soluble complexes or used in converting cyanide to other related species such as thiocyanate and cyanate. The high costs associated with cyanide and thiocyanate detoxification and excessive cyanide utilisation encountered when treating ores with high cyanide consumption constitutes a significant proportion of the overall processing costs. This study examines the possibility of recovering free cyanide from thiocyanate using a process based on the Acidification-Volatilisation-Regeneration (AVR) circuit in conjunction with a pre-concentration stage using commercially available ionexchange resin. From thermodynamic modelling based on the STABCAL program it was found that it was thermodynamically possible to recover cyanide from thiocyanate if the oxidation of cyanide to cyanate can be stopped. Addition of copper to the system found that the majority of the thiocyanate exists as copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) solid. Using ion-exchange resins can be an effective way to concentrate thiocyanate from tailing solutions or slurries. Four different models were successfully used to model the equilibria between thiocyanate and chloride on commercial ion-exchange resins. By normalising the equilibria data when applying the Mass action law the equilibria becomes independent of ionic strength within the range of concentration considered. An advantage of this is that only one unique equilibrium constant is used to describe the ion-exchange process. The electrochemical and kinetic studies showed that the reaction between thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide is catalysed by hydrogen ions. Secondly under acidic conditions the rate of cyanide recovery by the AVR circuit was faster than at higher pH conditions. The overall reaction of thiocyanate with respect to the concentration of thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide is an overall third order reaction. The derived third order rate expression is first order with respect to thiocyanate concentration and second order with respect to hydrogen peroxide concentration. Previous studies showed that the production of cyanide inhibits the reactions between thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide, but by removing cyanide from the reaction by air stripping, this was not observed. Addition of copper to the system did not show a catalytic effect on the reaction but it was found that copper (II) ions suppresses competing reactions that occurred without affecting the reaction between thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Measurement of Threats to Patient Safety in Australian General Practice</field><field name="creator">Makeham, Meredith Anne Blatt</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Patient Safety</field><field name="subject">General Practice</field><field name="subject">Incident reporting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3899</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Real-Time Communication Framework for Wireless Sensor Networks</field><field name="creator">AAL SALEM, MOHAMMED</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless Sensor Networks, Real-Time Communication, QoS</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct interaction with large displays through monocular computer vision</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Kelvin</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Large displays</field><field name="subject">Monocular computer vision</field><field name="subject">Direct interaction</field><field name="subject">Natural interaction</field><field name="subject">Hand Pointing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Struggles for recognition: The development of HIV/AIDS curricula in schools of social work in Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Chung, Dau-Chuan</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS</field><field name="subject">curricula</field><field name="subject">social work education</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="subject">genealogical analysis</field><field name="subject">content analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation into User Text Query and Text Descriptor Construction</field><field name="creator">Pfitzner, Darius Mark</field><field name="description">Cognitive limitations such as those described in Miller's (1956) work on channel capacity and Cowen's (2001) on short-term memory are factors in determining user cognitive load and in turn task performance. Inappropriate user cognitive load can reduce user efficiency in goal realization. For instance, if the user's attentional capacity is not appropriately applied to the task, distractor processing can tend to appropriate capacity from it. Conversely, if a task drives users beyond their short-term memory envelope, information loss may be realized in its translation to long-term memory and subsequent retrieval for task base processing.

To manage user cognitive capacity in the task of text search the interface should allow users to draw on their powerful and innate pattern recognition abilities. This harmonizes with Johnson-Laird's (1983) proposal that propositional representation is tied to mental models. Combined with the theory that knowledge is highly organized when stored in memory an appropriate approach for cognitive load optimization would be to graphically present single documents, or clusters thereof, with an appropriate number and type of descriptors. These descriptors are commonly words and/or phrases.

Information theory research suggests that words have different levels of importance in document topic differentiation. Although key word identification is well researched, there is a lack of basic research into human preference regarding query formation and the heuristics users employ in search. This lack extends to features as elementary as the number of words preferred to describe and/or search for a document. Contrastive understanding these preferences will help balance processing overheads of tasks like clustering against user cognitive load to realize a more efficient document retrieval process. Common approaches such as search engine log analysis cannot provide this degree of understanding and do not allow clear identification of the intended set of target documents.

This research endeavours to improve the manner in which text search returns are presented so that user performance under real world situations is enhanced. To this end we explore both how to appropriately present search information and results graphically to facilitate optimal cognitive and perceptual load/utilization, as well as how people use textual information in describing documents or constructing queries.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognitive Load</field><field name="subject">Text Search</field><field name="subject">HCI</field><field name="subject">Search Engines</field><field name="subject">Search Optimisation</field><field name="subject">Keyword Extraction</field><field name="subject">Document Summarisation</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090805.141402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Part-of-Speech Bootstrapping Using Lexically-Specific Frames</field><field name="creator">Leibbrandt, Richard Eduard</field><field name="description">The work in this thesis presents and evaluates a number of strategies by which English-learning children might discover the major open-class parts-of-speech in English (nouns, verbs and adjectives) on the basis of purely distributional information. Previous work has shown that parts-of-speech can be readily induced from the distributional patterns in which words occur. The research reported in this thesis extends and improves on this previous work in two major ways, related to the constructional status of the utterance contexts used for distributional analysis, and to the way in which previous studies have dealt with categorial ambiguity. 

Previous studies that have induced parts-of-speech from word distributions have done so on the basis of fixed &#147;windows&#148; of words that occur before and after the word in focus. These contexts are often not constructions of the language in question, and hence have dubious status as elements of linguistic knowledge. A great deal of recent evidence (e.g. Lieven, Pine &amp; Baldwin, 1997; Tomasello, 1992) has suggested that children&#146;s early language may be organized around a number of lexically-specific constructional frames with slots, such as &#147;a X&#148;, &#147;you X it&#148;, &#147;draw X on X&#148;. The work presented here investigates the possibility that constructions such as these may be a more appropriate domain for the distributional induction of parts-of-speech. This would open up the possibility of a treatment of part-of-speech induction that is more closely integrated with the acquisition of syntax.

Three strategies to discover lexically-specific frames in the speech input to children are presented. Two of these strategies are based on the interplay between more and less frequent words in English utterances: the more frequent words, which are typically function words or light verbs, are taken to provide the schematic &#147;backbone&#148; of an utterance. The third strategy is based around pairs of words in which the occurrence of one word is highly predictable from that of the other, but not vice versa; from these basic slot-filler relationships, larger frames are assembled.

These techniques were implemented computationally and applied to a corpus of child-directed speech. Each technique yielded a large set of lexically-specific frames, many of which could plausibly be regarded as constructions. In a comparison with a manual analysis of the same corpus by Cameron-Faulkner, Lieven and Tomasello (2003), it is shown that most of the constructional frames identified in the manual analysis were also produced by the automatic techniques.

After the identification of potential constructional frames, parts-of-speech were formed from the patterns of co-occurrence of words in particular constructions, by means of hierarchical clustering. The resulting clusters produced are shown to be quite similar to the major English parts-of-speech of nouns, verbs and adjectives. Each individual word token was assigned a part-of-speech on the basis of its constructional context. This categorization was evaluated empirically against the part-of-speech assigned to the word in question in the original corpus. The resulting categorization is shown to be, to a great extent, in agreement with the manual categorization.

These strategies deal with the categorial ambiguity of words, by allowing the frame context to determine part-of-speech. However, many of the frames produced were themselves ambiguous cues to part-of-speech. For this reason, strategies are presented to deal with both word and context ambiguity. Three such strategies are proposed. One considers membership of a part-of-speech to be a matter of degree for both word and contextual frame. A second strategy attempts to discretely assign multiple parts-of-speech to words and constructions in a way that imposes internal consistency in the corpus. The third strategy attempts to assign only the minimally-required multiple categories to words and constructions so as to provide a parsimonious description of the data.

Each of these techniques was implemented and applied to each of the three frame  discovery techniques, thereby providing category information about both the frame and the word. The subsequent assignment of parts-of-speech was done by combining word and frame information, and is shown to be far more accurate than the categorization based on frames alone. This approach can be regarded as addressing certain objections against the distributional method that have been raised by Pinker (1979, 1984, 1987).

Lastly, a framework for extending this research is outlined that allows semantic information to be incorporated into the process of category induction.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">part-of-speech bootstrapping</field><field name="subject">word classes</field><field name="subject">language learning</field><field name="subject">lexically-specific frames</field><field name="subject">construction grammar</field><field name="subject">usage-based linguistics</field><field name="subject">POS tagging</field><field name="subject">developmental psychology</field><field name="subject">psycholinguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090805.143606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Board characteristics and firm performance: evidence from New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bathula, Hanoku</field><field name="description">Due to various corporate scandals and failures, there has been a renewed interest on the role of boards in the performance of firms.  This thesis examines the relationship between the key board characteristics and firm performance.  Unlike most studies on boards which predominantly use only financial variables affecting governance, I take a different approach by combining them with non-financial variables.  This combined set of variables is used for theoretical and empirical modelling. Based on the extant literature, I develop a conceptual framework and a set of hypotheses to examine the relationship between board characteristics and firm performance.  Board characteristics considered in this research include board size, director ownership, CEO duality, gender diversity, educational qualification of board members and number of board meetings.  Additionally, I use board size as a moderating variable to examine how the effect of other board characteristics is contingent on board size.  Firm performance is measured by return on assets. I test my hypotheses on a longitudinal sample of 156 firms over a four year period from 2004 to 2007.  My sample includes all firms listed on New Zealand stock exchange as on November 2007.  Empirical analysis is undertaken using Generalised Least Squares analyses. The findings of the study show that board characteristics such as board size, CEO duality and gender diversity were positively related with firm performance, where as director ownership, board meetings and the number of board members with PhD level education was found to be negatively related.  Board size was found to be moderating some of these relationships, indicating the critical role being played by board size in the design and role of corporate boards.  The findings also provide partial evidence to different governance theories, further indicating the need for theoretical pluralism to gain insights into boards&#8217; functioning. The study contributes to the understanding of board-performance link by examining both the traditional variables such as board size, CEO duality, and number of board meetings as well as other organisational attributes such as gender diversity and competence variables represented by women and PhD holders, respectively.  The theoretical framework and the findings of my thesis are expected to stimulate scholars for further research to identify the contingency conditions upon which the board characteristics and firm performance may be dependent.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate boards</field><field name="subject">Board characteristics and meetings</field><field name="subject">Top management teams</field><field name="subject">CEO duality</field><field name="subject">Women on boards</field><field name="subject">Director ownership</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/376</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ashes without reserve</field><field name="creator">O'Connor, Maria Th&#233;r&#232;se</field><field name="description">This thesis is centrally concerned with the texts of Jacques Derrida that have addressed directly the theme of sexual difference. Yet to say the thesis is centrally concerned with a philosophy that positions itself clearly as one that deconstructs centrality and its trajectory of return, is to face the crisis or chiasmus of my concern. The thesis is not returned to Derrida. If the question of feminism for Derrida is a question from the margins, from interruptions, of the trace and of la cendre, ashes, the question of sexual difference is primordially and originarily that of the undecidability of the name, signatory, and textual border. She would not have appeared here. Therefore she cannot return. There are two frames to this research that can be recognized in the chapter sequence of the thesis. Initially I develop a preparatory engagement to a questioning of the ontology of sexual difference, with Chapters 2 and 3, with a questioning that broaches the metaphysics of the feminine with respect to the texts of Derrida, Heidegger and Cixous in particular and further engages with &#201;criture F&#233;minine, Levinas and feminist responses to Heidegger and Levinas. However, this broader questioning is undertaken in order to develop a sharper focus on the writings of Derrida that address Heidegger&#8217;s ontological difference, Levinas&#8217;s ethics before being, and a more originary questioning of sexual difference. The second frame and predominant focus of the thesis is on Derrida&#8217;s approach to the metaphysics of the feminine with four pivotal texts by Derrida from the late 1970s and early 1980s examined in Chapters 4 to 7. Each addresses a questioning of difference and the metaphysical tradition, under difference&#8217;s many names: ontological difference, sexual difference, diff&#233;rance, and engages deconstruction&#8217;s encounters with Nietzsche &amp; Heidegger (Spurs); the psychoanalysts Abraham &amp; Torok (&#8220;Fors&#8221;); Levinas (&#8220;At This Very Moment in This Work Here I Am&#8221;) and Hegel (Glas). In bringing together these four texts, my aim is to emphasize the significance of a double deconstructive movement of transgression and restoration, as this research&#8217;s politico-ethical acts of writing and reading for an otherwise discourse on sexual difference. This otherwise discourse has always already been produced with phallogocentrism and remains critical for the inventing of thresholds across philosophy, literature and their others.

The focus by researchers and by practitioners on corporate reputation and on its management attests to an expanding interest. Yet there remains disparate knowledge about how corporate reputation should be defined; about what are its key components; about the relationships between those components and about how corporate reputation should be measured. This point to a need for clarification: to develop a methodology based on ontology of corporate reputation that has relevance for a company&#8217;s various stakeholder groups.  This research builds on a review of the academic literature and employs text analysis, the nominal group technique and a quantitative survey among stakeholders about the reputation of a high profile company. Theory-driven analysis provides insights into the corporate reputation construct and into a tool for measurement that takes into consideration stakeholder perceptions of a company&#8217;s reputation. The results of the study indicate that, in the eyes of its stakeholders, a company&#8217;s reputation is driven by nine factors: image, identity, management leadership, performance, corporate brand, products and services, financial performance, ethical management and leadership, and corporate leadership. Not all nine components share the same degree of relevance for stakeholders: different stakeholder groups rank the importance of the components of corporate reputation differently; they evaluate the reputation of the same company differently. The drivers of stakeholders&#8217; overall evaluations of a company&#8217;s reputation vary by stakeholder segment. Stakeholder groups are seen to display the characteristics of segments.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate reputation</field><field name="subject">Reputation measurement</field><field name="subject">Reputation ontology</field><field name="subject">Stakeholders</field><field name="subject">C-OAR-SE procedure</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive inspired mapping by an autonomous mobile robot</field><field name="creator">Wong, Chee Kit</field><field name="description">When animals explore a new environment, they do not acquire a precise map of the places visited. In fact, research has shown that learning is a recurring process. Over time, new information helps the animal to update their perception of the locations it has visited. Yet, they are still able to use the fuzzy and often incomplete representation to find their way home. This process has been termed the cognitive mapping process. The work presented in this thesis uses a mobile robot equipped with sonar sensors to investigate the nature of such a process. Specifically, what is the information that is fundamental and prevalent in spatial navigation? Initially, the robot is instructed to compute a &#8220;cognitive map&#8221; of its environment. Since a robot is not a cognitive agent, it cannot, by definition, compute a cognitive map. Hence the robot is used as a test bed for understanding the cognitive mapping process. Yeap&#8217;s (1988) theory of cognitive mapping forms the foundation for computing the robot&#8217;s representation of the places it has visited. He argued that a network of local spaces is computed early in the cognitive mapping process. Yeap coined these local spaces as Absolute Space Representations (ASRs). However, ASR is not just a process of partitioning the environment into smaller local regions. The ASRs describe the bounded space that one is in, how one could leave that space (exits) and how the exits serves to link the ASRs to form a network that serves as the cognitive map (see Jefferies (1999)). Like the animal&#8217;s cognitive map, ASRs are not precise geometrical maps of the environment but rather, provide a rough shape or feel of the space the robot is currently in. Once the robot computes its &#8220;cognitive map&#8221;, it is then, like foraging and hoarding animals, instructed to find its way home. To do so, the robot uses two crucial pieces of information: distance between exits of ASRs and relative orientation of adjacent ASRs. A simple animal-like strategy was implemented for the robot to locate home. Results from the experiments demonstrated the robot&#8217;s ability to determine its location within the visited environment along its journey. This task was performed without the use of an accurate map. From these results and reviews of various findings related to cognitive mapping for various animals, we deduce that: Different animals have different sensing capabilities. They live in different environments and therefore face unique challenges. Consequently, they evolve to have different navigational strategies. However, we believe two crucial pieces of information are inherent in all animals and form the fundamentals of navigation: distance and orientation. Higher level animals may encode and may even prefer richer information to enhance the animal&#8217;s cognitive map. Nonetheless, distance and orientation will always be computed as a core process of cognitive mapping. We believe this insight will help future research to better understand the complex nature of cognitive mapping.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognitive mapping</field><field name="subject">Spatial reasoning</field><field name="subject">Inaccurate mapping</field><field name="subject">Mobile robot</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The artist will be present: performing partial objects and subjects</field><field name="creator">Braddock, Christopher Gregory</field><field name="description">'The Artist Will Be Present' explores objects as traces that stem from performed actions, and my body in performance. Part-sculptural objects, video and sound act as performance documents that expand on notions of the &#8216;live&#8217; encounter. Interest lies in how we get to objects: process in variance to product or closure. And the question of how the body/s of the audience becomes participatory is at the forefront of these operations. From this viewpoint the exegesis aims to broaden existing scholarship on performativity, liveness and the part-sculptural object, exploring the manners in which various cultural practices act to animate objects. I reconsider the Euro-American genealogies of performance/body art (Bruce Nauman, Lygia Clark, Ann Hamilton et al.) in relationship to contemporary art practices in Australia and New Zealand (Alicia Frankvich, Carolyn Eskdale et al.) through the lens of late 19th-and early 20th-century writing on sympathetic magical action. A legacy of cultural anthropology dealing with magic (that was privileged in establishing grounding aspects of structural linguistics) circulates around the British anthropologist Stanley J. Tambiah whose thinking on persuasive analogy in ritual performance draws a crucial link between J. L. Austin&#8217;s performative utterance and James George Frazer&#8217;s notion of sympathetic magic. From such a perspective the operations of sympathetic mimesis&#8212;involving ambivalent similitude and contagion&#8212;are discussed in terms of performative and persuasive illocutionary force. This offers another model for articulating an authentic performative document as an encounter with the &#8216;live.&#8217; A phenomenological method of enquiry, including Maurice Merleau-Ponty&#8217;s concept of the chiasm,&#8212;along with notions of mimetic incongruence&#8212;crucially tease out relationships between the live and the performance document and aim at resisting subject/object dichotomies whereby concepts of embodiment and indeterminate play between artist, objects and audiences are activated.  Applied to contemporary debates on performance and &#8216;objects out of action,&#8217; part objects and images are transformed as partial &#8216;subjects&#8217;: metonymically part of larger wholes as trace (substitution) and contagious contact (liveness). What is lacking in the operations of sympathetic mimesis is precisely what &#8216;draws out&#8217; the body/s of the audience as they desire closure in object and duration. As these questions turn on the body of the artist/self and the audience/participant in performative installation practice, I offer an analysis of bodies in ritual exchange (donor/donee); subjects and objects as transformers: relations of force over form&#8212;liminal, reversible and redolent of lack&#8212;that emphasise encounter in difference to recognition. This is to speak of, in the words of Lygia Clark: &#8220;Tactile shocks to liberate the body.&#8221;</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Part objects</field><field name="subject">Donor</field><field name="subject">Objects out of action</field><field name="subject">Performance documents</field><field name="subject">Sympathetic magic</field><field name="subject">Artist's body</field><field name="subject">Participation</field><field name="subject">Mimesis</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Performative installation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the impact of the Priority Club Rewards programme on the Crowne Plaza Auckland Hotel's revenue development performance</field><field name="creator">Gualberto, Renato  H</field><field name="description">In 2004, 6% of the Crowne Plaza Auckland Hotel's guests were Priority Club members.  Two years later, this number has more than doubled to 13%.  Are the Priority Club guests contributing to leverage the hotel's profitability? This research is aimed at answering the question if the continuous increase in the number of Priority Club guests staying at the Crowne Plaza Auckland Hotel is an opportunity for the property to effectively optimise its revenue generation performance.  The study is essentially focused on assessing the ability of the loyalty programme to generate revenue to the hotel. The Priority Club Rewards is a demand-based, revenue-orientated marketing strategy which is predominantly aimed at 1) promoting and attracting its 30 million members worldwide to stay at the company's extensive portfolio of hotels as well as 2) to entice the club members to spend money on the hotels' services and facilities.  In return for their loyalty, these customers are entitled to receive benefits that correspond to their membership level. From a revenue management perspective, the programme exists to strategically help hoteliers not only to achieve higher occupancy levels through repeat visits from the club members but to also leverage the hotel's revenue generating performance through encouraging its members to not only stay in suites and club rooms but also to use the property's services and facilities more regularly.  In other words, the objective of the Priority Club Rewards is to help hoteliers attract customers to their properties and at the same time encourage them to spend money whilst onsite. It was found that the Priority Club programme is fulfilling its first core objective, which is to bring more customers to the Crowne Plaza Auckland property.  Hence, this research is predominantly focused on assessing the rewards programme's ability to also assist the Auckland hotel to increase profitability.  The objective of this project is to analyse whether or not the increasing growth in the number of club members staying at the property can also be interpreted as a growth in the hotel's revenue generation performance. Firstly, a thorough review of the literature was conducted in order to identify any previous academic work that specifically analysed the relationship between the areas of revenue management and loyalty marketing.  However, no extensive previous research was found that effectively analysed how these two fields interact with each other, particularly in the hotel industry.  Nevertheless, research from Internet articles and other web-based media resources was highly beneficial to the success of this research. There were two data collection processes employed in this research: a Priority Club Survey identified the needs and preferences of the club members when staying at the Auckland hotel and, secondly, a Spending Pattern Analysis was conducted based on the hotel guests' account statements.  The results from these two research methods were then carefully analysed and interpreted in order to achieve an accurate set of resourceful conclusions and recommendations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Revenue management</field><field name="subject">Rewards programme</field><field name="subject">Business strategy and attraction</field><field name="subject">Hotel services</field><field name="subject">Loyalty programme</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 'culture of practice' of Ministry of Education Special Education occupational therapists and physiotherapists</field><field name="creator">Simmons Carlsson, Carolyn</field><field name="description">Occupational therapists and physiotherapists have increasingly moved into mainstream school-based practice in Aotearoa/NZ over the last ten years, however little is known about what underpins their practice worldview in today&#8217;s climate of inclusive education. This ethnography addressed the question: what is the culture of practice of occupational therapists and physiotherapists in the Ministry of Education, Special Education? In search of participants&#8217; emic perspectives of their culture, the ethnographic lens was used to inform the design of this study, which is situated theoretically within interpretive constructionism. Thirteen experienced Ministry of Education, Special Education occupational therapists and physiotherapists participated in this study. Semi-structured, face-to-face interviewing was used with eight therapists and a second email interview format was used with a further five therapists. Data were supplemented by complete-member-researcher observations in the field, as well as journal notes and written archival material from the organisation. Data analysis followed an ethnographic evaluative framework (Katz, 2001, 2002) and a cultural constructs framework, drawn from literature pertaining to ethnography and culture. The findings in this study reveal that the culture of practice of Ministry of Education, Special Education therapists is emergent. This culture is strongly embedded in organisational culture as well as the Aotearoa/NZ Government&#8217;s mission towards building an inclusive society. Findings from this study also reveal that contrary to the expectation that therapists may step into the organisation and be .fit to practice. in the education sector, this is indeed not the case. Therapists must be enculturated and supported in order to develop their understandings of the education system and what this demands of their school-based practices. Even given the support of therapy-specific induction, supervision and mentoring, the transition into the education model is huge. Because this, findings strongly point to the need for the organisation to support therapists&#8217; enculturation by offering formal, therapy-specific induction programmes. For the group in this study, theirs is a culture of inclusion, collaboration, consultation, teaming and inclusive practice. Furthermore, it is a culture that values students being students, with passionate aspirations towards fostering and enabling student learning and participation in schooling. To effect such change related to notions of inclusive education, the higher order task of the culture and, therefore the group&#8217;s practice, is one of brokering inclusion as agents for societal change. Within this, there is recognition that new entrant Ministry of Education, Special Education (MoE-SE) therapists must shift their traditional practice understandings and ways of being when working in the education sector to unshackle biomedical model perspectives. They must shift their worldview of school-based therapy.  Through this study, occupational therapists and physiotherapists are offered an exemplar of what this shift might look like. It also provides a practice exemplar of what it is like to practice in a different paradigm and of environmental practice. Lastly, the findings from this study challenge the occupational therapy and physiotherapy professions, practitioners and lecturers alike, to shift beyond entrenched biomedical perspectives and to take up the staff of occupational practice. Moreover, they challenge the professions to be true to the pursuit of activity and participation outcomes for the clients, whom they all serve. This study therefore provides a tool to help ease transition. It also provides a clear way to articulate the extent of the shift from biomedical model to occupational practice in school-based practice. Further research is required related to capturing the students&#8217; voice in relation to Ministry of Education, Special Education therapy services and how they experience the culture. The range of potential studies remains great, given the paucity of local research related to school-based therapy practice and inclusive education. Studies into teachers&#8217; and parents&#8217;  experiences are warranted, as are studies which explore the experiences of M&#257;ori therapists and M&#257;ori clients. It may be interesting to compare therapists. Cultures across practice contexts, such as the special schools, and between health and education sectors. It may be helpful to look at whether therapists do find it useful to have MoE-SE practice explained in cultural terms. An outcomes-based study would help provide practice-based evidence for what works and what doesn&#8217;t. Other studies might address issues such as: when inclusion is achieved, what does it achieve educationally and socially or is harm done when therapy services shift away from dealing with impairment and what is the long-term personal outcome to the student when this occurs. Lastly, a study that addressed whether embracing the culture of practice actually makes a difference in the long term for students would be valuable.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of ethanol, honey, milk and essential oils as potential postharvest treatments of New Zealand grown fruit.</field><field name="creator">Lihandra, Eka Manggiasih</field><field name="description">Brown and Penicillium rot (blue and green mould) are the most common postharvest diseases in New Zealand, causing significant postharvest fruit losses. Current practice uses fungicides to control the postharvest diseases; however there are perceived health risks associated with the use of such chemicals. Recently, there has been substantial interest in chemicals that are considered Generally Regarded as Safe or GRAS and natural products as alternative postharvest treatments to replace currently used fungicides. In this study, ethanol (GRAS chemical) and the natural products honey, milk and essential oils (lemon, lemongrass, manuka and orange) were assessed as potential alternative treatments to replace the currently used fungicides on both peaches and oranges. In pilot studies ethanol was applied to the fruit by either vapour or dipping (30 seconds or 1.5 minutes). Honey, milk and essential oils were applied by dipping at 30 seconds. Essential oils were also tested using a microtiter assay. Exposing fruit to ethanol vapour proved effective at inhibiting fungal growth, but impacted negatively on fruit quality. Peaches that were exposed to 70% to 100% ethanol vapour were protected against fungal infection for up to 30 days when stored at either 4&#186;C or room temperature.  This is compared to two days for untreated peaches and three days for fungicide -treated peaches. However, the ethanol-treated peaches suffered from severe browning. In contrast, 20% ethanol protected peaches for ten days when stored at 4&#186;C and two days at room temperature. The fruit that were exposed to 20% ethanol did not brown as a result of the treatment. Oranges that were exposed to 20%, 50%, 70% and 100% ethanol vapour were protected from fungal inhibition for 30 days at both 4&#186;C and room temperature, but they too suffered from severe browning. Dipping was not as effective as vapour at protecting against fungal infection, but had a little effect on fruit quality. Peaches dipped in 20% to 100% ethanol were completely rotten by ten days when stored at room temperature, but the peaches experienced little to no browning. Untreated and fungicide-treated fruit were protected for one day and two days, respectively. Milk and honey do not appear to have potential as postharvest treatments. Peaches that were treated with 20%, 50% and 100% whole milk and 50% manuka honey showed greater degree of fungal infection compared to untreated peaches after both room temperature and 4&#186;C storage. At room temperature, peaches that were exposed to 20%, 50% and 100% milk were completely rotten at eight days, compared with ten days for untreated peaches. In contrast, at 4&#186;C, peaches that were treated with 100% milk were completely rotten at 30 days, while only a slight fungal infection observed on untreated fruit. Similar to milk, honey-treated peaches were also completely rotten at 30 days at 4&#186;C storage.In vitro (microtiter) assay of the essential oils showed that orange and manuka oils appeared to be effective only at high concentrations. In contrast, lemongrass and lemon oils appeared to be effective even at low concentrations. Of the essential oils tested in the in vivo assay, lemongrass and lemon oils have the greatest potential. Oranges that were exposed to 0.05% lemongrass oil, 0.25% and 0.5% lemon oil were protected for 30 days when stored at 4&#186;C or room temperature. They provided the best antifungal activity compared to the other concentrations of all four essential oils tested as well as fungicide treatment for 30 days. Of all the treatment tested, 0.05% lemongrass oil, 0.25% and 0.5% lemon oil appeared to be the most promising treatments. However, these treatments need to be tested for antifungal effects, fruit quality, flavour and nutritional effects in large scale experiments before they can be applied as replacements to currently used fungicides. Also, essential oils are complex compounds; therefore it would be of interest to determine the active compound(s) of the lemongrass and lemon oils.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Postharvest treatments</field><field name="subject">Fruit</field><field name="subject">Essential oil</field><field name="subject">Honey</field><field name="subject">Milk</field><field name="subject">Ethanol</field><field name="subject">Biological control</field><field name="subject">Food preservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/165</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consumer evaluations of brand imitations: an investigation</field><field name="creator">Su, Sasa</field><field name="description">Brand imitation is viewed as an infringement of the imitated original brand. (Zaichkowsky, 1995). Although brand managers and researchers have looked into ways to fight against imitations, these are still prevalent in today's market. Researchers have found that one of the major reasons for the growing volume of imitations has been consumer demand. Thus, rather than studying ways to reduce imitations, it is first important for brand managers and researchers to understand why consumers would knowingly buy imitations. The major issue is to understand how consumers evaluate brand imitations. Several studies have explored factors that might have an influence on consumer evaluations of brand imitations. However these findings are limited. For example, similarity of the imitation to the original brand is an important factor in consumer evaluations. However, very little research has studied this aspect. Thus, this research is motivated to further investigate the influential factors of consumer evaluations of brand imitations. This study replicates d'Astous and Gargouri (2001), a study that examines a comprehensive set of factors that might influence consumer evaluations of brand imitations. The purpose of this study is to re-examine their hypotheses in various product categories, with a focus on luxury brands. Moreover, this study has extended the d'Astous and Gargouri (2001) study by investigating product similarity which had not been previously explored. However, hypothesis testing did not completely support the hypothesized effects. The results indicate that consumers who purchase luxury brand imitations are heavily influenced by the price and store image. The results show also that the factor of product similarity is unimportant to a customer purchasing imitator brands.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brand choice</field><field name="subject">Brand name products</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/183</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Destruction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's) and aliphatic hydrocarbons in soil using ball milling</field><field name="creator">Magoha, Happy Steven</field><field name="description">This study involves the use of ball mill as a mechanochemical reactor in the destruction of environmental contaminants. Although the technology has the potential to be used for a wide range of organic contaminants, this study focused on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's) and aliphatic hydrocarbons. There are different methods for the remediation of the environmental contaminants such as biological, chemical and thermal techniques, most of which are costly. The ball mill is less costly as it involves low technology and little or no other chemicals seem to be needed to give complete destruction of the substances investigated. The mill is relatively easy to construct and can be made in different designs and dimensions to fit its intended purpose i.e. they can range from a laboratory scale to a very large industrial mill for the continuous processing of tonnes of material at a time. The process can be sealed so pollution from the mill is easy to control. In this study two classes of environmental contaminants were investigated. PAH's are common by-products of combustion and are found as contaminants in many soils. The other compounds investigated were the larger aliphatic hydrocarbons. These were chosen as being representative of the evaporated residues from fuel spills or leaks. A laboratory scale centrifugal ball mill with capacity of approximately 200 g was used for the study. The PAH's investigated were naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene. The aliphatic hydrocarbons n-eicosane and n-octacosane were used as the model compounds for hydrocarbon residues. Different soil types (scoria, clay soil, silica sand and slag) were spiked with a known amount of these contaminants. The ball milling was done under different milling conditions i.e. with different ball ratio and with different milling duration. In some experiments there was an addition of materials such as a potential free radical trap or metals to investigate the effect on the mechanochemical reaction. The samples were analysed using an ultrasonic extraction method (EPA METHOD 3550C) with GC and GC-MS analysis of the extract for the quantification of the residual contaminant in the soil and identification of possible secondary products and reaction intermediates. It was found that high destruction efficiency was achieved using milling times of between 120 and 150 minutes and high ball to soil ratios for example 7:1 ball mass to soil mass ratio. Also it was found that different type of soil had an influence on the mechanochemical reaction. A silica matrix was found to have a better destruction rate compared to scoria and clay soil. It was also found that the PAH compounds were more rapidly destroyed by ball milling than were aliphatic hydrocarbons. The addition of BHT was found to reduce destruction rate of both PAH's and aliphatic hydrocarbons. This suggests the mechanism of destruction may involve a free radical mechanism. Aluminium metal was observed to have no significant effect in the destruction. The presence of lubricants such as waxes in the contaminated soil appeared to inhibit the mechanochemical reaction although the mechanism is still uncertain. From this study it was concluded that, the ball mill has considerable potential as an effective, low cost method for the destruction of certain environmental contaminants.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrocarbons</field><field name="subject">Pollutants</field><field name="subject">Enviornmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/184</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anticipatory lower limb muscle activity during a turning task</field><field name="creator">Ngan-Hing, Lisa</field><field name="description">Two experiments were undertaken. The objective of Experiment One was to identify the lower limb muscles that were most frequently active during the early period of a step turning task for further testing in Experiment Two. In Experiment Two participants undertook multiple trials of a step-turning task, 30 and 60&#176; to the left and right of midline, at a self-selected pace in response to a visual cue. There were five objectives to Experiment Two. Firstly, to identify the predominant order in the onset of foot movement so that anticipatory muscle activity could be defined for this task. Secondly, to identify whether there is a consistent temporal order in movement onset between the head and the feet. Thirdly, to identify whether and how consistently anticipatory lower limb muscle activity is present bilaterally. Fourthly, to assess whether there is a consistent sequence in the onset of anticipatory muscle activity among muscles active in at least 80% of trials. The final objective was to identity whether there was a consistent temporal relationship in the onset of the anticipatory muscle activity present in at least 80% of trials, with the onset of head and foot movement. Study Design: A repeated measures design was used. Background: Anticipatory lower limb muscle activity in gait initiation and forward stepping studies has been reported to be consistently present, and associated with initial and important balance responses. Falls during turning are associated with a high incidence of hip fractures in the elderly population. The presence of anticipatory lower limb muscle activity turning has not been previously reported. Participants: There were five participants in Experiment One, and ten in Experiment Two. All were between 18 and 40 years of age and did not have neurological or musculoskeletal disorders, or severe visual loss. Results: In Experiment One, four muscles were consistently active bilaterally, during the early period of step-turning and were: tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, biceps femoris and gluteus medius. In Experiment Two the ipsilateral foot moved before the contralateral foot in 68% of trials towards the left, and 79% of trials towards the right. The onset of head movement consistently occurred before the onset of foot movement during turns towards both directions. The percentage of trials in which the four muscles were active in an anticipatory manner was low bilaterally, ranging from 12 to 38% of trials. Objectives that involved the further analysis of muscles active in at least 80% of trials were unable to be completed. Conclusions: During a step-turning task young healthy adults predominantly move their ipsilateral foot before their contralateral foot. The consistent onset of head movement prior to that of the feet, indirectly suggests that the visual system might influence the temporal onset of the feet. The low levels of anticipatory muscle activity during step-turning suggest that the lower limbs are not involved with the initial balance responses for this task thus making it inherently different to gait initiation and forward stepping.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gait in humans</field><field name="subject">Human locomotion</field><field name="subject">Leg - Movements</field><field name="subject">Leg - Muscles - Physiology</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/191</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of surface EMG temporal and spectral parameters from the vastus medialis of subjects with and without knee joint osteoarthritis during a sustained, fatiguing submaximal isometric contraction</field><field name="creator">Molloy, John</field><field name="description">Knee joint osteoarthritis is recognised as a significant subset of osteoarthritis. Little work has examined muscle changes that occur with knee joint osteoarthritis. Much of this work has centred on strength deficits, while little work has examined the effect of joint pathologies, such as osteoarthritis, on the fatigue resistance of the muscles associated with an affected joint. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relative fatigue-resistance characteristics of the vastus medialis in subjects with and without knee joint osteoarthritis, as well as the ability to predict endurance times in these groups, using high spatial resolution electromyography and a sub-maximal isometric endurance test. Twenty-six subjects with unilateral knee osteoarthritis and seventeen subjects with no known knee pathology were evaluated. All subjects performed initial tests to evaluate maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), voluntary activation levels, and true maximum force (TMF). Endurance time was assessed during an isometric quadriceps contraction at 50% of the true maximum force. Surface electromyography (sEMG) data was collected from the vastus medialis muscle of the quadriceps group during the endurance test. MVC tests showed that the affected leg of the group with osteoarthritis was significantly weaker (p &lt; 0.05) than the unaffected leg. Voluntary activation data showed that subjects with osteoarthritis presented with significant bilateral deficits (p &lt; 0.05). TMF data showed a significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) true potential for force generation in the affected compared to the unaffected leg of the osteoarthritis group. Endurance time data showed no significant difference between groups. Electromyography data showed significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) between the affected and unaffected legs in initial values of Median Frequency (MDF), Mean Power Frequency (MPF) and Conduction Velocity (CV), the percentage change in CV and the relative rate of change in the frequency band between 5 and 30Hz (FB1). Finally, significant correlations were seen between endurance time and the relative rate of change of MDF, MPF and CV calculated over the initial thirty seconds of the endurance test. There were no significant correlations from either leg of the group with knee joint osteoarthritis.It can be concluded from this study that there are differences in strength measures, and in the sEMG signal collected from the vastus medialis muscle of the affected and unaffected legs of subjects with knee osteoarthritis. It appears likely that the differences observed in the sEMG signals were related to a decrease in the representation of type-2 muscle fibres in the vastus medialis of the affected leg. Furthermore, these changes in the behaviour of the signal appear to indicate an improvement in the relative fatigue resistance of the affected leg in relation to the unaffected leg of the group with knee osteoarthritis.Moderate success was seen with the prediction of endurance time in control subjects in the current work using a short duration (30-second) endurance test. This relationship was not seen in either the affected or unaffected leg of the subjects with knee osteoarthritis. Further investigation utilising different sEMG collection and analysis techniques in this area may improve prediction of endurance time in unaffected and affected subjects.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knee</field><field name="subject">Electromyography</field><field name="subject">Osteoarthritis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical factors that influence staff retention in an acute perioperative environment</field><field name="creator">McClelland, Beverley</field><field name="description">There are a number of factors recognised as significant for nursing staff retention. These include, a lack of organisational care, bullying (commonly referred to as horizontal violence), and high workload acuity. However, there does not appear to be any indication that these factors influence the retention of nurses within the speciality of acute perioperative nursing. A descriptive study using postpositivist methodology and triangulation of methods was designed to answer the question: What are the critical factors that influence staff retention in an acute perioperative environment? Forty-eight (n = 48) perioperative nurses answered a questionnaire in relation to individual needs, provision of nursing care and administration and management. Four (n = 4) nurses subsequently participated in a focus group interview that explored in more depth, the survey data related to the following characteristics: Educational opportunities; Level of workload acuity; Rostering flexibility; Management; Established policies/Quality assurance; Graduate orientation programs and Professional relationships in an acute perioperative setting. Data analysis revealed that &gt; 90% of respondents agreed that these characteristics are important for job satisfaction and influence staff retention in an acute perioperative environment. A sense of belonging appears to be the most important theme that emerged from the qualitative data. Job satisfaction and staff retention are attained when nurses have a sense of belonging in the workplace. To achieve these, nurses need to identify barriers, develop their communication and leadership skills and determine the ideal professional practice model. The themes (Figure 5), "Finding time" and increased "sick leave", in relation to workload acuity are new findings that provide a platform for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nurses</field><field name="subject">Supply and demand</field><field name="subject">Surgical nursing</field><field name="subject">Perioperative Nursing</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being together and separate: a grounded theory study of the experience of first-time fathers during childbirth</field><field name="creator">Carbines, Maria</field><field name="description">This grounded theory study explored the experience of first-time fathers during the time of birth with the aim of developing a conceptual framework to explain how they managed the process. In sharp contrast to the recognised maternity care practices of a generation ago, most fathers in New Zealand are currently expected to be present when their babies are born. There has been little New Zealand-based research to determine what the birth experience is like for fathers. Because contemporary fathers are expected to fulfil a major role in the care and support of mother and baby from pregnancy through to new parenthood and beyond, exploring the experience of fathers during birth is a way to understand part of the childbirth process from the perspective of husbands or partners in the developing new family. Eleven first-time fathers from the North Island of New Zealand participated in antenatal and postnatal interviews that were conducted over a 20-month period. Transcripts were analysed using grounded theory processes of coding, constant comparative analysis and theoretical sampling, and a conceptual diagram was developed to explain the core process which was discovered, namely, 'being together and separate'. It emerged that fathers could feel separate from the birth process, together with the birth process and at times they could experience both positions concurrently. Influences on participants' experience of 'being together and separate' included social expectations, the level of control that participants wished to have during the birth and the ways in which fathers were drawn in or excluded by wives/partners and maternity caregivers. The ways in which maternity caregivers responded to the involvement of fathers in the birth process was found to have a significant impact on the participants' experience of the process. Implications for the practice of maternity caregivers and childbirth educators are the importance of assessing each father's needs antenatally and of assisting them to develop strategies for participating comfortably in the birth experience. The relevance of supporting fathers to participate in the childbirth process at a level that promotes positive birth outcomes for the entire expectant family is demonstrated, and some practical strategies are provided that can assist health professionals and others to support fathers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fathers</field><field name="subject">Childbirth</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Balancing the desirable with the feasible: a study of how marketing and operations need to work together to ensure that branding promises can be delivered in practice.</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Catherine Mary</field><field name="description">The concept of student as customer and marrying the concept of treating the student as a customer whilst delivering tertiary education which is both effective and rigorous is an issue which is currently being strongly debated.The objective of this thesis is to consider the student as a principle customer in the delivery of a particular brand of knowledge product, and the level of customer satisfaction they receive relative to the knowledge brand of their choice. Brand refers to the name and reputation of the knowledge provider, Auckland University of Technology, and the level and type of qualification achieved, the MBA degree.The marketing function promotes the brand. The day-to-day management of the process of learning is performed through operations. Thus, in providing tertiary education, how is the brand and the desired objectives of customer satisfaction promoted with the brand, balanced with organisational competencies when applied to the AUT MBA learning process.A triangulation approach has been applied in conducting both qualitative and quantitative research involving MBA students, lecturers and management staff at AUT in order to ascertain whether marketing promises were met. Key findings were that the perception of the quality of the MBA programme showed a statistically significant difference between satisfaction levels of graduate MBA students and undergraduate MBA students in the areas of flexibility, student orientation and support provided with applications and enrolment. Furthermore, the collective responses for both groups of students for all questions showed that although both groups of students appeared to demonstrate a general level of satisfaction with the MBA course, there was a general movement away from strong agreement for graduate students towards strong disagreement for undergraduate students.

The concept of stress relating to on-call work, the general lack of interest or confidence in the respiratory on-call field, and subsequent difficulties with recruitment and retention, pose a difficult problem for managers of services responsible for the maintenance of a competent workforce and a high standard of service provision. Differences in novice and expert physiotherapists&#8217; patient management and clinical reasoning strategies have been previously examined in orthopaedic, neurology, domiciliary and cardiorespiratory fields.  However, no such investigations have been undertaken in the field of emergency on-call. The purpose of this study was to determine if differences existed between novice and expert physiotherapists who had by definition differing levels of context-related experience within the emergency on-call environment. This study also aimed to consider what factors may influence their physiotherapy intervention for an acute cardiorespiratory patient.  A purpose-designed vignette-based postal questionnaire was administered to 26 emergency on-call providers in New Zealand. The questionnaire sought demographic data, investigated participants&#8217; attitudes towards emergency on-call service provision and presented a vignette-based clinical scenario which asked questions throughout an evolving clinical case scenario.  Analysis was performed using the computer software package for social sciences, SPSS for Windows (version 14), results were analysed using descriptive statistics, and significance testing was performed using non-parametric methods.  A good response rate was achieved (78.8%; n = 56). Statistically significant differences between novices and experts were determined in scores for confidence, stress, and support required, also in the factors affecting stress levels.  Novices are less confident (p = &lt; .0001), more stressed (p = &lt; .001) and require more support than experts (p = &lt; .001). Factors which influenced both novice, and to a lesser extent, expert stress levels when working as emergency on-call physiotherapists, were established.  A relationship was determined between confidence and level of support required (r = -.65; p = &lt; .001); confidence and amount of stress felt (r = -.58; p = &lt; .001); and support required and stress felt (r = .47; p = &lt; .001). Some differences were demonstrated between novice and expert physiotherapists in their answers to a clinical case scenario.  Although these were not statistically significant, a trend was noted which may reflect the different clinical reasoning strategies of these physiotherapists. There is a need for novices to gain the type of experience which includes independent problem solving and guided reflection; the use of vignette-based case studies may be one method which could be further exploited. The profession is responsible for the provision of better ways to meet the needs of our future emergency on-call workforce.  If this is not achieved, other professional groups will be required to fill the gaps and physiotherapy; particularly cardiorespiratory physiotherapy will lose out.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Determining differences</field><field name="subject">Novices and experts</field><field name="subject">Physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Emergency on-call</field><field name="subject">Vignette</field><field name="subject">Survey</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysing the nature of relationships between organisations and their stakeholders: a stakeholder and organisational enablers relationships (SOER) framework</field><field name="creator">Karabadogomba, Jean Pierre</field><field name="description">Little is known about how employees in New Zealand companies view their organisation&#8217;s involvement in community-based initiatives that attempt to address areas of social needs. Understanding what people and organisations think from their frame of reference (Taylor &amp; Bodgan, 1998) on ways of contributing to enhance community wellbeing is of high importance within a nation growing in diversity, and where everyone needs to fully participate in building a harmonious society (Ministry of Social Development, 2005; Swanson, 2002). Despite abundant extant research and many models already developed, frameworks in this area are fragmented. A case study approach has been adopted using one New Zealand Company to test a preliminary framework, Stakeholders and Organisational Enablers Relationship (SOER) Model, that analyses &#8220;the nature of relationships in terms of processes and outcomes for the business and its stakeholders&#8221; (Jones &amp; Wicks, 1999, p. 207). From investigating the company&#8217;s community involvement from the employees&#8217; perspective, results indicate that this particular company is engaging with the community, supporting and empowering employees to participate in the company&#8217;s community programme and thereby making a difference in the community by giving to the community. However, in general terms, solving recurring social, economic, political and psychological issues that influence social wellbeing requires cooperation between public, private, and voluntary sectors of the community (New Zealand Ministry of Economic Development, New Zealand Ministry of Social Development, New Zealand Dept of Labour, &amp; New Zealand Dept of Statistics, 2003; Roberts &amp; King, 1989; Steane, 1999). While the results from the case company reported in this study demonstrate that community engagement is being taken seriously by exemplary private sector companies, generalisation of these findings would require further cross-sectional research across industries and organisations from all sectors: private, public and voluntary.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="subject">Stakeholder theory</field><field name="subject">Community wellbeing</field><field name="subject">Corporate community involvement</field><field name="subject">Stakeholder and Organisational Relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/389</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Border crossing: work-life balance issues with Chinese entrepreneurs in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chan, Camellia</field><field name="description">Work-life balance is a dominant discourse in contemporary Western society. It has been built on a language of large organizations, hence has not been widely considered in relation to the small-medium enterprise sector. As a consequence, scant research has been conducted on the experiences of immigrant entrepreneurs and work-life balance within the small-medium enterprise sector in New Zealand, a country largely populated with migrants and small businesses which account for 96 per cent of the total enterprises. This study aims to fill this gap by firstly exploring the interpretations of the concept of work-life balance by Chinese immigrant entrepreneurs and, secondly, the main challenges they face in achieving work-life balance. This is done by drawing on literatures including those on work-life balance, small-medium enterprises, and immigrant entrepreneurship theories. Primary research was conducted using a critical interpretive approach where the researcher is an insider to the study. This philosophical and methodological approach makes it possible to give a minority group a voice to effect social change and gain further research attention. Fifteen Chinese business owners, chosen from a variety of industries within the Auckland region, participated in this study. A qualitative methodological technique and semi-structured interviews were used to collect the data for the case study on these entrepreneurs. The results indicate that the majority do not enjoy a sense of work-life balance because they take on filial obligations important for their own culture. They need to work hard to generate financial profit for the benefit of family. About half of them work more than 60 hours per week and three works longer than 70 hours weekly. The motivation for them to work in this way is to provide their family with desirable housing and to enable their children to meet higher education goals.  This study challenges the applicability of the work-life balance discourse among the immigrant entrepreneurs who perceive the concept differently based on their cultural values. The results emphasise the need for business case studies from Chinese immigrant entrepreneurs and research attention on contemporary human resource topics to be given to minority groups.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immigrant entrepreneurship theories</field><field name="subject">SME</field><field name="subject">Organizational citizenship behavior</field><field name="subject">Small and Medium Enterprises</field><field name="subject">Organisational citizenship behaviour</field><field name="subject">Familial obligations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The classroom as a learning community?

This thesis explores what eight postgraduate students judged to be their &#8216;best&#8217; classroom experiences within one New Zealand university. The researcher started from the assumption that the students&#8217; &#8216;best&#8217; classroom experiences  would correspond with what the literature characterises as &#8216;communities of learners&#8217; in which the students felt that their past experiences were valued and personal relationships were respectful and relatively equal.  This assumption was, for the most part, accurate.  Problematic areas, such as assessment, were also identified. International students&#8217; experiences were a key part of the research. Six of the students were studying in their second language yet that alone was not the main indicator of classroom participation as personality (such as shyness)also affected how students engaged with the course content, the lecturers, and with each other. The case study approach raises possibilities and questions as well as recognising trends that suggest that postgraduate students value interactive learning within meaningful classroom contexts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community of learning</field><field name="subject">Tertiary classroom experiences</field><field name="subject">Constructivist approach</field><field name="subject">Learning communities</field><field name="subject">Interviews</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The design of dialogue</field><field name="creator">Crowe, Peter</field><field name="description">With the first commitment of the Kyoto Protocol commencing in 2008, many signatory governments have identified bio fuels as a favoured response to the problem of fulfilling their countries' pledges to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels. Despite the tendency for pressure over climate change to expedite the commercialisation process, detailed evaluation of the claimed benefits, likely efficacy or environmental impact of bio fuels in New Zealand in the form of the Bio fuels Sales Obligation policy (BSO): a mandate place on the Oil Companies to supply a percentage of bio fuel.  Systems thinking propound the notion of complex interrelatedness: a pivotal concept in our current understanding of the cumulative effects of greenhouse gas emissions and their relationship to climate change. It also recognizes that the multiple ways in which different stakeholders perceive a contentious question are an integral feature of any problematical situation. By applying systems concepts to qualitative research, Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) is therefore particularly suitable for the analysis of multiple stakeholder discourse in this situation. The present study employs SSM to examine stakeholder opinion through the construction of conceptual models in the form of rich pictures and root definitions. The researcher invited diverse stakeholders to &#8216;see what they were thinking&#8217; and reflect upon the beliefs and assumptions that informed their views with respect to New Zealand bio fuels development. With reference to official documentation arising from the policy development process and through a series of interviews and a focus group, the research examines perceptions of the consultation process on bio fuels development and its contribution to informed decision-making. The study data indicates that the scope of enquiry tended to be restricted by early presuppositions regarding the consultation process and its desired outcomes, which consequently shifted the focus of consultation the enquiry from an assessment of the desirability of bio fuels to an appraisal of the feasibility of government policy. However inadvertently, communication was distorted. The research examines the basic assumptions that shaped the discourse and enabled already established opinions to prevail. Furthermore, the thesis explores how using SSM to surface tacit assumptions and challenge proposed models of intervention can help improve the reflexivity of discourse and decision-making. By ensuring open communication remains at the centre of discourse, SSM could provide a means of establishing productive conditions for learning and co-creative dialogue. Consequently the study has important implications for how the &#8216;health&#8217; of public discourse in New Zealand might be sustained when addressing other similarly complex issues.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soft Systems Methodology</field><field name="subject">Biofuels</field><field name="subject">Stakeholder discourse</field><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="subject">Rich pictures</field><field name="subject">Focus group</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Court of Appeal decision in Accent Management Ltd v CIR [2007] NZCA 230: statutory interpretation in New Zealand tax avoidance law</field><field name="creator">Than, Tut</field><field name="description">In June 2007, the Court of Appeal in New Zealand disallowed the taxpayers appeal and decided that Trinity Scheme is a tax avoidance arrangement.

Although New Zealand courts are not reluctant in using purposive approach in judicial reasoning, the final decisions rarely depart from literal meaning of the Act.

Four data collection methods were utilised generating 33,058 adult or larval invertebrates. The sampling methods comprised benthic kick-sampling, sticky trapping, light trapping, and emergence trapping. For the sticky trapping and light trapping, sampling was carried out at three different sites (Sites 1&#8211;3) within each location. The sites were situated within three habitat types; native forest, native forest-fringe, and raupo wetland. Emergence trapping also commenced within the three sites, at both locations, but was discontinued after two months, due to the equipment being destroyed by consecutive flooding events (method described in Appendix 1). Benthic sampling was carried out within the Forest and Forest-fringe habitats. Benthic sampling, sticky trapping, and light trapping were carried out following a monthly schedule between June and November 2005. Conductivity, pH, and water temperature measurements were taken concurrently with benthic sampling on a monthly basis, while water velocity and substrate measurements were taken once to assist in habitat characterisation. Overall, 71 taxa were recorded by benthic sampling over the six month period, with a mean of approximately 30 taxa per site per month. In comparison with similar studies elsewhere in New Zealand, a figure of around 30 taxa per sample was high. The benthic macroinvertebrate fauna at all sites was dominated by Trichoptera (19 taxa), Diptera (16 taxa) and Ephemeroptera (10 taxa). This pattern of diversity is similar to that reported in other New Zealand studies. However, in contrast to previous studies, the leptophlebiid mayfly genus Deleatidium was not numerically dominant over the rest of the community, and other leptophlebiid genera (Acanthophlebia, Atalophlebioides, Mauiulus and Zephlebia) were equally represented, possibly reflecting niche partitioning between the groups. The genus Nesameletus was not recorded at any site, despite being one of the core mayfly species in New Zealand streams. The rare mayfly Isothraulus abditus was recorded at one of the forest locations. There are no published records of this species from Northland. Although acknowledged as another of the core New Zealand benthic taxa, the hydropsychid caddisfly Aoteapsyche was not recorded during the study. However, another hydropsychid, Orthopsyche, was commonly recorded, and these may be filling a similar niche to the Aoteapsyche genus. In contrast to the Trichoptera, Diptera, and Ephemeroptera, the Plecoptera fauna was relatively depauperate, probably reflecting the warmer climate of the region and lack of temperature-buffered spring-fed streams. Surprisingly, Zelandobius, a core New Zealand genus, was absent but is regularly recorded in Northland. A species of conservation interest, Spaniocercoides watti, currently recognised as a Northland endemic, was recorded in low numbers. There were no apparent trends in diversity or abundance of benthic invertebrates over time. Also, there were no significant differences in species diversity between the two locations. However, in many cases, taxa were more abundant at Location 2. This may have been due to steeper gradients at Location 2, and the consequent effects on substrate size and streambed stability, as all other physical factors appeared similar between locations. Although several significant differences of individual benthic taxa were recorded, no broad effect of habitat (sites) on species diversity was observable. However, at Location 2, abundances were significantly higher at Site 3 (Forest) compared to Site 2 (Forest-fringe). The reasons were uncertain, but may be attributed to higher retention of allochthonous organic materials, trapped by in-stream cover and larger substrates. Investigations of adult stages by sticky traps supported benthic results recording community compositions and abundances dominated by Trichoptera and Diptera. Plecoptera were poorly represented. Location 2 recorded higher abundances of taxa, particularly Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera. Investigations of adult stages by light traps however did not produce any statistically significant differences in abundances between sites, between locations, or between sites across locations, and it is believed to be due to limited sampling replication combined with some biases of light trapping. This study indicates that the aquatic invertebrate community at Matapouri is diverse but also reasonably representative. Several rare or uncommon insects inhabit the catchment. It is therefore important that Iwi and the local Landcare Group, who invited and supported this research, together with the Department of Conservation, continue their efforts in protecting these areas. The resident fauna have the capacity to restock areas downstream, which are intended to be improved and restored through sediment control and riparian management.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquatic insects</field><field name="subject">Community composition</field><field name="subject">Habitat use</field><field name="subject">Kick sampling</field><field name="subject">Benthic macroinvertebrates</field><field name="subject">Northland</field><field name="subject">Light trapping</field><field name="subject">Sticky trapping</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of cyclodextrins on the flavour of goat milk and its yoghurt</field><field name="creator">Gupta, Rajni</field><field name="description">A previous study showed that addition of &#946;-cyclodextrin to goat milk made a difference to its flavour, but in an undescribed way. Cyclodextrins (CDs, comprising &#945;- &#946;- and &#947;-CD) may be able to bind the free branched chain fatty acids in goat milk responsible for the largely undesirable &#8216;goaty&#8217; flavour. The primary aim was to test the effect of CDs on this flavour in goat milk and its products with a view to marketing goat milk products with reduced flavour intensity. A secondary aim was to test the effect of &#946;-CD on skatole flavour, a characteristic flavour of milk from pasturefed ruminants. Study design and methods: The present study evaluates addition of mainly &#946;-CD to goat milk, cow milk and their products to reduce undesirable flavours. The methods applied were mainly ranking and hedonic assessment in sensory experiments. The tests done were with CDs added to buffers and milks, some of which were flavour-enhanced with 4-methyloctanoic acid as a representative goaty fatty acid, or with skatole. Goat milk yoghurts were also tested. Free fatty acid concentrations, which may be affected by CD binding, were measured after separating cream and skim milk. The methods applied were standard dairy procedures: titration of free fatty acids in milk fat and the copper-salt method for measuring fatty acids in skim milk. A fungal lipase was added to milks to accelerate fat hydrolysis (lipolysis). This was done to increase the concentration of free fatty acids for several experimental purposes. Some minor experiments studies were also done, for example the comparative effect of lipases on goat milk and cow milk, and the lipolytic activity at different temperatures over different times. Results: The results of skatole experiments were inconclusive. The odour of 4-methyloctanoic acid was reduced in acidic buffers by addition of &#945;- and &#946;-CD, particularly the former. Alpha and &#946;-CD were both effective in goaty flavour reduction in goat milk. &#947;-CD was not effective. In all this work differences were statistically significant to varying levels. Goaty flavour was reduced by addition of &#946;-CD to goat milk yoghurt, but only when added before fermentation (P &lt; 0.001), not after (P = 0.09). The liking scores for goat milk yoghurts for both plain and flavoured yoghurts increased with &#946;-CD treatment (both P &lt; 0.001 for 59 panellists). The chemistry experiments revealed a reduction of free fatty acid concentration in the fat phase when &#946;-CD treatment was added to full cream cow milk. However, analysis of skim milk did not show a corresponding increase in concentration. Further experiments are required to reveal the fate of the &#8216;missing&#8217; fatty acids. Conclusion: Overall it was shown that under certain conditions, CDs were effective in reducing goaty flavour in milk and yoghurts. Whereas CDs are approved for addition to foods in many countries &#8211; including the bellwether U.S.A. &#8211; formal approval by Food Standards Australia New Zealand has not yet been finalized. When it is, the way should be clear to market a range of more consumer-acceptable goat milk products in New Zealand as a primary market. In short, this research has significant commercial relevance.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food technology</field><field name="subject">Dairy products</field><field name="subject">Sensory experiments</field><field name="subject">Odour intensity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a grapefruit-flavoured spirit with the opalescence properties of pastis</field><field name="creator">Chaipongrattana, Pornphun</field><field name="description">In the form of a potable spirit, an extract of grapefruit skin has been found to develop an attractive opalescence when diluted to below about 38 % ethanol (v/v).  This phenomenon is analogous to the pastis effect, called louching, common in many drinks popular in some countries bordering the Mediterranean. The main objective of this research was to develop spirit liquor with commercial potential from grapefruit skin, largely a waste commercial product, as the dominant if not exclusive ingredient other than alcohol and water. This would require making extracts by distillation of undried skins, which would develop a dense opalescence significantly below 40 % v/v ethanol, the common alcoholic strength of spirits as sold in New Zealand. The product concept was thus a clear liquid which when poured over ice for example, would yield a cool opalescent drink with a characteristic grapefruit flavour. In the case of citrus, the chemical basis of louching is the greater solubility of citrus skin terpenes, principally limonene, in ethanol than in water.  The louch point is synonymous with the chemical expression critical micelle concentration, detected here by light scattering at the arbitrary wavelength of 450 nm.  Early results with an obvious opalescence showed that the alcohol concentration at which the terpenes ceased to be soluble in the grapefruit distillate was about 38 % (v/v).  This point was similar to that for pastis (Pernod brand), where the principle louchable ingredient is anethole.  However, the light scattering was much greater for pastis. Thus, a grapefruit spirit sold at 40 % ethanol with the louching intensity of pastis should require increasing the solubility of limonene in solutions with a lower ethanol concentration.  This in turn should allow higher concentrations of limonene in true solution in 40 % ethanol, theoretically resulting in a more intense louch in the final drink.  Thus, a broad range of hydrocolloids and surfactants was tested in an attempt to increase the solubility of limonene in lower ethanol concentrations.  None of hydrocolloids or surfactants lowered the louch point of a standard limonene concentration in ethanol/water. The informal flavour assessment showed that the spirit flavour from grapefruit zest alone lacked intensity.  It was then thought that better flavour might be obtained by using the whole grapefruit (zest, pith, and juice) rather than zest alone. The additional of pith or pith plus juice caused no significant change in the louch point or light scattering.  However, the final flavour was informally judged to be more intense than that derived from zest alone. The problem still remained that the light scattering of grapefruit distillate was never as high as that achieved by pastis, even though it was found (by gas chromatography) that the concentration of limonene (w/w) in the grapefruit spirit was at least as high as that of anethole in pastis.  The cause was due to the fact that as a louched compound, anethole was a solid with a flat crystal structure because the melting point (21.4&#61616;C) is well above that of a cool drink (Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 1947).  By contrast, limonene remains a liquid even in an iced drink because its melting point is far below 0&#61616;C.  Flat crystals would obviously scatter light far more than would a micelle containing a liquid, in this case limonene. Although such a grapefruit distillate did not louch as well as pastis, it could still have market potential on the basis that it would be made from the distinctive New Zealand cultivar of grapefruit.  Thus a formal sensory assessment was conducted, using a focus group.  The grapefruit distillates at 40 % ethanol were perceived by most panellists as refreshing, clean, fruity, and citrusy in aroma, but somewhat deficient in grapefruit flavour, and there was a common perception of strong chemical finish. At this stage of development a commercial proposition cannot be sensibly made.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grapefruit</field><field name="subject">Zest</field><field name="subject">Louch</field><field name="subject">Pastis</field><field name="subject">Focus group interviews</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a gluten-free commercial bread</field><field name="creator">Rakkar, Pardeep Singh</field><field name="description">Because of coeliac disease, some individuals cannot tolerate the protein gliadin present in the gluten fraction of wheat flour.  From a commercial perspective, there is a need for the development of gluten-free bread with texture and flavour properties similar to the conventional wheat flour loaf.  In the context of bread, the gluten component of wheat has a crucial role in stabilising the gas-cell structure and maintaining the rheological properties of the bread.  The absence of gluten results in liquid batter rather than pre-baking dough, yielding baked bread with a crumbling texture, poor colour and other post-baking quality defects.  The liquid batter cannot be processed on the existing production line of baking industry. The aim is to develop a gluten-free white loaf with similar quality characteristics to that of standard white bread on the existing processing lines at Quality Bakers New Zealand.  Within this constraint, dough has to be produced with handling and moulding properties similar to those of conventional wheat flour loaves.  This research focused on finding and implementing the gluten substitutes for the development of gluten-free high quality commercial bread. In this research, the independent variables were conventional wheat flour (the most basic control), other gluten-free flours from a variety of sources, starches, supplementary proteins,  hydrocolloids such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), hydrophilic psyllium husk, and enzymes such as microbial transglutaminase, glucose oxidase, lipase and fungal &#945;-amylase.  These ingredients were trialled in different combination and composition to produce a dough having ability to trap the carbon dioxide gas during proofing and baking to get high specific volume bread suitable for the Quality Bakers&#8217; product range. After an essentially &#8216;shotgun&#8217; approach to formulations, the research narrowed to a systematic and progressive variation of ingredients and their composition to develop workable commercial models.  Ingredients and their compositions were manipulated according to the outcomes of the trials and their contribution in the formulations.  The dependent variables included standard bakery rheological properties based on dough stickiness, dough extensibility, oven spring, bread specific volume, bread slice ability, and bread staling. A gelation system of the lower-temperature-stable hydrocolloid psyllium husk, the heat-stable hydrocolloid hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, maize starch, and potato starch was created to form industrial process able dough having ability to entrap carbon dioxide gas produced during proofing and initial phase of baking.  Microbial transglutaminase was used to increase the cross linking of protein present in flours and supplemented for enhancing the dough-like structure and its gas entrapping abilities. A formulation has been discovered by this research for the development of high quality gluten-free commercial bread.  The formulated bread has similar quality characteristics to that of standard white bread and can be produced on existing processing lines at Quality Bakers. Industrial process able gluten-free bread with similar quality characteristics to that of standard white bread can be formulated by using a specific combination of soy flour, maize starch, potato starch, yoghurt powder, milk protein, HPMC (K4M), psyllium husk, microbial transglutaminase, lipase, and fungal &#945;-amylase.  The significance of this research is mainly commercial and the insights gained may extend to other bakery items that could be used by coeliacs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gluten composition</field><field name="subject">New Zealand bread market</field><field name="subject">Wheat sensitivity</field><field name="subject">Experimental approach</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bridging to new possibilities: a case study of the influence of a bridging education programme</field><field name="creator">Walker, Catherine</field><field name="description">In the rapidly changing &#8216;knowledge economy&#8217; where &#8216;innovation&#8217; and &#8216;responsiveness&#8217; are vital, tertiary education can be at a point transformation. Since the late 1990s the New Zealand government began to shift part of its tertiary education policy with an increasing focus on what is commonly called &#8216;foundation&#8217; education. The shift was aimed at ensuring all New Zealanders are equipped for the knowledge economy and raising the skills of individuals. A variety of research and education programmes were launched, and existing foundation or bridging programmes strengthened through policy, research and educational endeavours. Bridging education programmes (a subset of foundation education) are designed to prepare non-traditional and under-prepared students for ongoing study at a higher level. This current research sought to identify the influence of a university bridging programme (Level 4) on students who progressed into further study at undergraduate level. The bridging programme commenced in 2003 providing a pathway for students into undergraduate health degrees. The key question for this thesis was: how does bridging education influence students? To determine the influence of the bridging programme, this research was based on a case-study of seven students who completed four or eight papers in the bridging programme. Participants were in ongoing study (for at least one year) in a Bachelor of Health Science (any major). The methodology was qualitative in design, drawing extensively on a case-study approach to research the influences of the bridging programme. The method of data collection utilised was individual semi-structured interviews with former bridging students to ascertain their perceptions, views and experiences of the influence of a bridging programme, both historically and currently. In examining this unique context, information on the influences of bridging education was explored and the importance of bridging education, from the participant&#8217;s perspective, understood more clearly. This thesis and the research within revealed that the influence of the bridging programme began at the participant&#8217;s time of enrolment and continued into their undergraduate study and their lives. The bridging programme influenced the way participant&#8217;s interacted with a range of factors including: the institution; their undergraduate programme; with educators and peers; and with family, friends and others in society. Equally, it is acknowledged that these factors influenced the participant&#8217;s, facilitating or impeding their ongoing learning. The participants also identified several challenges (financial and relational) related to the influence of tertiary study which they faced. The research revealed the programme influenced their ongoing success and continuation in undergraduate study. The programme provided an effective bridge into tertiary education (academically, emotionally and socially). Participant&#8217;s acknowledged the influence on their cognitive and meta-cognitive growth and development. The range of tertiary leaning skills and knowledge gained and/or enhanced was considerable. Close links between the academic skills taught in the bridging programme and required in undergraduate study were evident. Positive improvements in confidence, self-efficacy and motivation were also attributed to the influence of the programme. Holistic personal development occurred as the skills and knowledge gained and developed were transferred and extended from academia into other areas of the lives of former bridging students and thus further influenced their family, personal friends and society. The influence of the bridging programme has enabled new opportunities, ways of being and employment to become more than a dream, but a reality which the participants continue to move towards. Overall, it could be claimed that the influence of the bridging programme was holistic. A series of recommendations are provided for theory, policy and practice. The significance for social issues and action are discussed and avenues for further research outlined.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bridging</field><field name="subject">Foundation</field><field name="subject">Holistic</field><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="subject">Transformative education</field><field name="subject">Interviews</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) techniques in New Zealand: Array simulation, image synthesis and analysis</field><field name="creator">Weston, Stuart Duncan</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the design and development of a process to model Very Long Base Line Interferometry (VLBI) aperture synthesis antenna arrays. In line with the Auckland University of Technology (AUT) Institute for Radiophysics and Space Research (IRSR) aims to develop the knowledge, skills and experience within New Zealand, extensive use of existing radio astronomical software has been incorporated into the process namely AIPS (Astronomical Imaging Processing System), MIRIAD (a radio interferometry data reduction package) and DIFMAP (a program for synthesis imaging of visibility data from interferometer arrays of radio telescopes). This process has been used to model various antenna array configurations for two proposed New Zealand sites for antenna in a VLBI array configuration with existing Australian facilities and a passable antenna at Scott Base in Antarctica; and the results are presented in an attempt to demonstrate the improvement to be gained by joint trans-Tasman VLBI observation. It is hoped these results and process will assist the planning and placement of proposed New Zealand radio telescopes for cooperation with groups such as the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA), others in the Pacific Rim and possibly globally; also potential future involvement of New Zealand with the SKA. The developed process has also been used to model a phased building schedule for the SKA in Australia and the addition of two antennas in New Zealand. This has been presented to the wider astronomical community via the Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand Journal, and is summarized in this thesis with some additional material. A new measure of quality (&#8220;figure of merit&#8221;) for comparing the original model image and final CLEAN images by utilizing normalized 2-D cross correlation is evaluated as an alternative to the existing subjective visual operator image comparison undertaken to date by other groups. This new unit of measure is then used in the presentation of the results to provide a quantative comparison of the different array configurations modelled. Included in the process is the development of a new antenna array visibility program which was based on a Perl code script written by Prof Steven Tingay to plot antenna visibilities for the Australian Square Kilometre Array (SKA) proposal. This has been expanded and improved removing the hard coded fixed assumptions for the SKA configuration, providing a new useful and flexible program for the wider astronomical community. A prototype user interface using html/cgi/perl was developed for the process so that the underlying software packages can be served over the web to a user via an internet browser. This was used to demonstrate how easy it is to provide a friendlier interface compared to the existing cumbersome and difficult command line driven interfaces (although the command line can be retained for more experienced users).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">VLBI</field><field name="subject">Array</field><field name="subject">Simulation</field><field name="subject">Image</field><field name="subject">Synthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The cross-cultural leader: a comparative study of leadership behaviours in China and New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ao, Xiang</field><field name="description">National cultures play a critical role in effective leadership and organisational success in international businesses. Contemporary organisations are therefore challenged by cross-cultural leadership needs to address increasing diversity. In the past decades, there has been a growing interest in studies of non-Western leadership. Recent papers have focused particularly on leadership in the Asia-Pacific region. This paper compares leadership in China and New Zealand, based on the data collected by using the GLOBE (Global Leadership and Organisational Behaviour Effectiveness) project leadership questionnaire. In addition, the paper reviews the main findings of previous research in order to investigate the similarities and differences in preferred leadership behaviours/characteristics in both cultures, while attempting to examine the consistency of current findings against the previous GLOBE studies. Significant differences of leadership behaviours between China and New Zealand have been identified.  This paper generally supports the findings of previous GLOBE studies that charismatic/value-based leadership is the universally contributing factor towards outstanding leadership and self-protective leadership is the universally negative factor against leadership excellence. Findings in this paper may contribute to further understanding of leadership practice in these two countries.  Future research should be undertaken to examine the effects of cultural differences on organisational practice by a more comprehensive research method.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cross-cultural leadership</field><field name="subject">GLOBE</field><field name="subject">Cultural expectation</field><field name="subject">Etic and emic approach</field><field name="subject">Multivariate analysis of variance MANOVA</field><field name="subject">International business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bursting bubbles: a moving image exploration of contemporary Chinese individuality</field><field name="creator">Gao, Yi</field><field name="description">This thesis is a practical project which involves moving images and paintings together as a medium that explores phenomena of contemporary China relating to personal identity, independence and its relationship with the traditional importance on collective groups, group centredness and interdependence.

While there have been many cases and literature on management of culture integration for merger and acquisition from a Western perspective, few have discussed cultural integration in an Asian context. This study provides a case study of cultural integration strategies Lenovo has undertaken to manage employees from both teams after the M&amp;A. It adopts a semi-structure face-to-face interview research method, which 5 participants were selected from the culture integration committee for interview. During the interview, each participant answered the questions from their perspective of the job position they are currently in. The method would enhance the quality of the research as it looks into the problems and strategy that Lenovo has encountered and undertaken from various points of view. However, as no employees from IBM PC-D on the committee were available to participate in the research, it might place some limitations on the research simply because IBM team&#8217;s opinions were not taken into account. After analysing the results obtained from the participants, the researcher found that there were several motives for Lenovo to acquire IBM PC-D, including: - 1) internationalization, 2) acquiring technology and skills, 3) acquiring a brand, 4) obtaining access to new customers, 5) increase bargaining position to suppliers. Among these five motives, acquiring brand was considered to be the most important motive. As Chinese product has always been marketed at the lower end of the product line with low costs and poor quality, acquiring IBM&#8217;s brand would enable Lenovo to boost its product image and to gain access to customers outside the Chinese market. In managing two teams within the organisation, Lenovo has taken very few steps to integrate two teams into one. Instead, a separate management mode was encouraged by Lenovo to allow IBM PC-D to maintain its own management system and procedures. In addition, a culture integration committee was voluntarily set up by employees from various departments to design initiatives to encourage communication between two teams. When problems arise due to the difference between two teams, Lenovo has adopted an accommodation strategy by making adjustments to the work schedule of its employee in the Lenovo team in order to accommodate employees in IBM team. As a result, it has increased the workload for staff in Lenovo team and this may thus lead to stress and work-life imbalance to its employees. Overall, the strategy that Lenovo has adopted to manage two teams seems to have worked well and the culture integration committee appears to have served well in encouraging the communication between two teams. On the other hand, as the participants in the interview were not directly involved with the designing and crafting the strategy of culture integration, that might have some limitation on the result. Therefore, it is suggested that further research can be done to capture the opinion from members that are directly involved in the design of culture integration strategy as well as teams from IBM PC-D in order to ensure a well provided empirical and consistent view.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cultural integration</field><field name="subject">Merger and acquistion</field><field name="subject">Globalization</field><field name="subject">Internationalisation</field><field name="subject">Organisational behaviour</field><field name="subject">Organizational behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A civil and ecclesiastical union? The development of prison chaplaincy in Aotearoa-New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mansill, Douglas B</field><field name="description">New Zealand prisons were a colonial construct established by early colonial administrations to deal with criminal behaviour occurring at the time of European settlement.  Like the prison system, prison chaplaincy also had its origins in colonial experiences from the United Kingdom where chaplains were employed to meet the spiritual needs of those in institutions such as schools, hospitals, colleges, the military and legations. This thesis addressed the question of how the partnership between Church and State administrators in New Zealand for the provision of chaplaincy services developed between 1840 and 2006.  Four phases were identified in the evolution of prison chaplaincy: phase one 1840-to-1950, characterised by ad hoc arrangements between clergy and local prison management; phase two 1951-to-1989 when Secretary for Justice Samuel Barnett established a formal relationship with the National Council of Churches and the Roman Catholic Church to provide chaplains for penal institutions; phase three identified as &#8216;prisons in change&#8217; 1990-1999, when the Interim Chaplaincy Advisory Board and Prison Chaplaincy Advisory Board worked in tandem with the Departments of Justice and Corrections to administer the Prison Chaplaincy Service, arising from the recommendations of the Roper and Perry Reports; and phase four 2000-to-2006, a period when the Prison Chaplaincy Service of Aotearoa New Zealand was contracted to the Department of Corrections to employ prison chaplains. The research adopted a multi-faceted approach, consisting of phenomenology, ethno-methodology and hermeneutics to understand attitudes and experiences of key players and institutions in the evolution of Prison Chaplaincy. Data was collected through interviews of key informants, critical evaluation of published and unpublished material in public and private collections. The study identified six key factors that influenced the development of Prison Chaplaincy in New Zealand. These were: the nature of the Church-State interface, the impact of biculturalism, the influence of theological and ecclesiastical trends, and the impact of inter-church politics, the influence of socio economic trends and developments, and changes in Government policy.  It also found that while there were tensions, the Church-State partnership had positive benefits for the spiritual outcomes for prisoners.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Religion and penal system</field><field name="subject">Government and Christianity</field><field name="subject">Multi-faceted methodology</field><field name="subject">Capital punishment</field><field name="subject">Jail, incarceration, gaol, penitentiary</field><field name="subject">Church and society</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drivers of Australian merger waves: industry shocks, mis-valuation and capital liquidity</field><field name="creator">Porwal, Anmol</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to test the extended industry shock hypothesis, which accounts for a macro-economic capital liquidity element, in determining the drivers of merger waves. Various theories have been extended by the literature and these are broadly classified under the neo-classical theory of merger waves and the behavioural theory of merger waves. Behavioural theories have explained merger waves by taking into account the psychology of stock markets and the occurrence of merger waves during a stock market boom. The industry shock hypothesis (a neo-classical theory) however, argues that merger waves are due to the clustering of industry shocks that affect an industry&#8217;s operating environment. Along with this shock, the mis-valuation caused by a stock market boom increases asset values, thereby lowering transaction costs and hence increasing capital liquidity in the economy. This capital liquidity factor causes merger waves to cluster even if industry shocks do not.  The findings in this study show that industry level merger waves exist in Australia and they occur when there is sufficient capital liquidity in the economy. The industry shock variables are found to be insignificant; however they do improve the explanatory power of the explanatory variables used in predicting the start of a merger wave. The mis-valuation variables used in this study: market-to-book ratio, 3-year return and standard deviation of the 3-year return, are insignificant and do not have any explanatory powers in predicting the start of a merger wave. Merger and acquisition announcements made to acquire Australian firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), are collected and analysed for the period from 1996 to 2007. The methodology used in this study is adopted from Harford (2005), which uses legit models to predict the start of merger waves. The explanatory variables are also adopted from Harford&#8217;s (2005) study and include proxies for mis-valuation, industry shock and capital liquidity. Overall, the results obtained for the Australian merger and acquisition data are inconclusive as to whether industry shocks because industry merger waves as Harford (2005) documented for the US merger and acquisition data. However, industry level merger waves do exist, as there is clustering in time of firm-level mergers within industries. Moreover, sufficient capital liquidity must be present to accommodate the necessary transactions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate environment</field><field name="subject">Industry shock theory</field><field name="subject">Australian merger and acquisition</field><field name="subject">Market to book ratio</field><field name="subject">Economic shock</field><field name="subject">Share market</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beach burial of cetaceans: implications for conservation, and public health and safety</field><field name="creator">Bui, Ann</field><field name="description">Every year hundreds of cetaceans strand on New Zealand beaches. Options for dealing with disposal of their carcasses are few, creating significant problems for the Department of Conservation (DOC). More often than not their carcasses are buried in beaches at or just above high water mark, near where the animals have stranded. The primary objective of this thesis is to determine the effects of cetacean burial on beach sediments, and evaluate potential health and safety risks associated with this practice. A secondary objective of this thesis is to appraise the appropriateness of one location DOC has repeatedly transported cetacean carcasses to and buried within beach sediments, Motutapu Island in Waitemata Harbour. The chemical effects of cetacean burial over a six-month period are reported for two sites at which animals were buried in 2008, Muriwai and Pakiri beaches; the biological effects of this burial are reported for one of these sites, Muriwai Beach, 12 months post burial. Intertidal faunal and floral inventories are provided for six sites around Motutapu Island, and these then compared and contrasted with inventories compiled from an additional 290 intertidal sites between Whangarei Heads and Tauranga Harbour, North Island East Coast, to appraise the relative uniqueness of intertidal species diversity around Motutapu Island. At both Muriwai and Pakiri beaches, nitrogen and phosphate concentrations in surface sands changed considerably following cetacean burial, although over six months the effect was localized and elevated concentrations of these two chemicals that could be attributed to a buried carcass did not extend more than 40 m from the site of whale burial. Deep-core profiles revealed nitrogen and phosphate concentrations at and in the immediate vicinity of cetacean burial approximately six months after burial to be markedly elevated to the level of the water table, but elevated concentrations attributable to the buried carcass were not observed greater than 25 m from the site of burial. Elevated concentrations of nitrogen and phosphates in beaches persist in surface sediments for at least six months post burial. Twelve months post cetacean burial no significant difference in species richness or abundance were apparent in intertidal communities extending along transects proximal to and some distance from the Muriwai Beach carcass; there is no evidence for any significant short-term (to 12 months) biological effects of cetacean burial in beaches. Of those shores on Motutapu Island accessible by earth-moving equipment and large vessels capable of dealing with and transporting large cetacean carcasses, Station Bay appeared to be the most appropriate site for whale burial. However its small size and relatively high biological value (fairly high species richness for comparable shores between Whangarei Heads and Tauranga) renders it an inappropriate long-term option for whale burial. Other shores on Motutapu Island host some of the highest species richness of all shores surveyed between Whangarei Heads and Tauranga Harbour, rendering them entirely inappropriate locations for burying cetaceans, over and above other variables that may influence disposal location identification (such as archaeological sites, dwellings and accessibility). Motutapu Island is not considered an appropriate location for cetacean burial within beaches. Alternative disposal strategies need to be explored for dealing with cetaceans that strand on Auckland east coast beaches. Although burial is the most convenient and most economical strategy to dispose of cetacean carcass, especially in mass stranding events or when cetaceans are of large size, and the biological effects of this practice are not considered significant (for the one whale that could be studied), persistent enrichment of beach sediments with organic matter could result in prolonged persistence of pathogens in beaches, causing unforeseen risks to human health and safety. Recommendations are made to minimize possible threats to public following burial of cetaceans in beaches, until the potential health risks of burial are more fully understood.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cetaceans</field><field name="subject">Conservation</field><field name="subject">Whales</field><field name="subject">Whale strandings</field><field name="subject">Chemical effects</field><field name="subject">Biological effects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/669</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'The Bobby Calf' - non linear and non classical narrative structures in the cinema of unease</field><field name="creator">Scrivin, Nicholas</field><field name="description">This document outlines the research, development and production of a creative work and accompanying exegesis in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Master of Communication Studies (MCS) programme.  It includes the first draft of a feature film screenplay and an exegesis that explores the research conducted, the theoretical context of the work, and analyses the screenwriting process undertaken. The Bobby Calf (2008) is the first draft of a feature film screenplay that uses a non-classical and non-linear narrative structure to tell the story of its main characters and advance the plot.    A psychological drama set in rural New Zealand, The Bobby Calf (2008) was originally inspired by the Janet Frame short story The Reservoir (1963), a story based on a group of youngsters who venture forth to discover the forbidden reservoir; a place their parents had forbid them from going.  Set in  the outskirts of a small farming settlement, the story is a dark and gothic depiction of rural life and the harshness of reality faced by those brought up in a lifestyle they did not choose.  The story focuses on the journey of ADAM (21); both as a young boy in 1988 (called JOHNNY) and as a young adult in 1997, and his mother CATH; a woman whose dreams and aspirations for her son and indeed her own life are slowly slipping away.   The story centres on Adam as he grows more uncomfortable with how his life has ended up, and his discovery that the life he has been destined to fulfil is not the one he has chosen.  Accompanying the screenplay is an exegesis that explores the research conducted previously on the history of non-classical/non-linear narrative structures and the rationale behind the success and limitations of this now-popular form of storytelling.  These types of narrative structures are not a new phenomenon, and as many authors have attested, the basis of this form of storytelling is rooted in the history of screenwriting and film making, and borrows many techniques from theatre and literature.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Non linear</field><field name="subject">Narrative structure</field><field name="subject">Bobby calf</field><field name="subject">Story-telling</field><field name="subject">New Zealand rural life</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/688</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tax competition and harmonization in Southeast Asia : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master in Public Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Berlianto, Aprinto</field><field name="description">Policy makers in the Southeast Asian region are faced with many challenges in national policy taxation from globalization, in particular the increasing cross-border mobility of capital. One of the challenges is the competition to attract a mobile capital base which leads to a trend towards declining statutory corporate taxation rates and a pressure to harmonize taxation policy. This study explores taxation literature and uses empirical evidence from the period of 1996-2006 to examine tax competition and tax harmonization in the region. The study seeks evidence for the existence of tax competition by analyzing recent trends in two groups of measures of taxation: tax rates and tax revenues. This begins with looking at the trends of statutory corporate tax rate. Evidence is found for a decline in statutory corporate tax rates, developments commensurate with the existence of tax competition. On the contrary, the tax revenue data presented here, show that the expected decline in total tax revenues has not occurred; indeed, a significant increase has been recorded. It is also supported by empirical evidence of the ratio of corporate tax revenue either relative to GDP or to total tax revenue. The strengthening of these revenues has meant that the expected shift in the tax burden away from mobile to immobile factors has also failed to materialize. The two groups of measures of taxation thus provide apparently inconsistent views of the impact of tax competition. There follows an analysis of the elements of tax competition according to literature, in an attempt to draw out its implications for the experience within the Southeast Asian region. This study also examines the case for tax harmonisation and the Southeast Asian experience and it is concluded that the progress of tax harmonisation between countries has tended to be difficult to achieve because of the differences among the countries in terms of the tax structures and level of economies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tax rates</field><field name="subject">tax revenues</field><field name="subject">taxation policy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360201 Public policy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/966</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vernacular, regional and modern- Lewis Mumford???s bay region style and the architecture of William Wurster</field><field name="creator">Castle, Jane, School of Architecture, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines aspects of the work of American writer and social critic, Lewis Mumford, and the domestic buildings of architect William Wurster. It reveals parallels in their careers, particularly evident in an Arts and Crafts influence and the regional emphasis both men combined with an otherwise overtly Modernist outlook. Several chapters are devoted to the background of, and influences on, Mumford???s regionalism and Wurster???s architecture. Mumford, a spiritual descendent of John Ruskin, admired Wurster???s work for its reflection of his own regionalist ideas, which are traced to Arts and Crafts figures Patrick Geddes, William Morris, William Lethaby and Ruskin. These figures are important to this study, firstly because the influence of their philosophical perspective allowed Mumford, almost uniquely, to position himself as a spokesman for both Romanticism and Modernism with equal validity, and secondly because of their influence upon early Californian architects such as Bernard Maybeck, and subsequently upon Wurster and his colleagues. Throughout the thesis, an important architectural distinction is highlighted between regional Modernism and the International Style. This distinction polarised the American architectural community after Mumford published an article in 1947 suggesting that the ???Bay Region Style??? represented a regionally appropriate alternative to the abstract formulas of International Style architecture and nominated Wurster as its most significant representative. Wurster???s regional Modernism was distinct from the bulk of American Modernism because of its regional influences and its indebtedness to vernacular forms, apparent in buildings such as his Gregory Farmhouse. In 1948, Henry-Russel Hitchcock organised a symposium at New York???s Museum of Modern Art to refute Mumford???s article. Its participants acrimoniously rejected a regionalist alternative to the International Style, and architectural historians have suggested that authentic regional development in the Bay Region largely ceased because of such adverse theoretical and academic scrutiny. After examining the influences on Mumford and Wurster, the thesis concludes that twentieth century regional architectural development in the San Francisco Bay Region has influenced subsequent Western domestic architecture. Wurster suggested that architects should employ the regional and vernacular rather than emulate historical styles or follow theoretical models in their buildings and Mumford, upon whose work Critical Regionalism was later founded, is central to any understanding of the importance of the vernacular, regional and historical in modern architecture.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wurster, William Wilson</field><field name="subject">Architecture, Modern -- United States</field><field name="subject">Architecture, Domestic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Porosity: the revision of public space in the city using public art to test the functional boundaries of built form.</field><field name="creator">Goodwin, Richard, School of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis tests the theories of Porosity which are part of my ongoing investigation into the revision and extension of public space in the city. Porosity Research seeks to classify spaces which exist deep within the skin or fabric of privately owned city buildings. The primary vehicle for this interrogation is the use of public art in the form of a set of games called Porosity Games ??? Snakes and Ladders, Hide and Seek and Jenga. These games are played out or performed within the territory of my Australian Research Foundation Discovery Grant outcomes. Their aim is to prove the validity of the research and to provoke interrogation of that research. The marginality of public art makes it ideally suited to the task of commenting on or contradicting the main body of the text of public space in the city. This contradiction is central to the work of this thesis.  One of the vital needs or reasons for this work lies in finding ways of preventing cities from being shut down as a result of rampant capitalism in the ???Age of Terror???. Porosity as a strategy attacks this trend. It seeks the dissolution of architecture through a type of mapping which dissolves existing boundaries associated with rights of access. Capitalism needs to be continually measured by mapping or defining what is public against what is private. It can be argued that the social construction of a city is as important as its physical manifestation as buildings. It can also then be argued that a city which allows public space to penetrate its private space enables a healthier social construction.  Fundamental to this thesis is the idea that the survival of the Western city depends on an increased density of public space and multiple ground planes as opposed to one. This creates three dimensional public access and alleviates congestion at the level of the street both for cars and for pedestrians.  The Porosity Games are a first step in the transformation of the city through their successful reinvention of internal circulation spaces as game space. Game 1: Snakes and Ladders and Game 2: Hide and Seek both operate without interruption by the propriety of the buildings. Game 3: Jenga then intentionally heightened the risk of capture and eviction of the players for transgression within the climate of fear. Both the framework of surveillance and the intention to claim private space for public use, make the performances and the Porosity Research a useful progression in the project of transformation and the city as a plastic medium for the artist to interrogate.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Porosity.</field><field name="subject">Public art.</field><field name="subject">Buildings.</field><field name="subject">Cities and towns.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution of climate anomalies and variability of Southern Ocean water masses on interannual to centennial time scales</field><field name="creator">Santoso, Agus, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this study the natural variability of Southern Ocean water masses on interannual to centennial time scales is investigated using a long-term integration of the Commonwealth Scientic and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) coupled climate model. We focus our attention on analysing the variability of Antarctic IntermediateWater (AAIW), Circumpolar DeepWater (CDW), and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). We present an analysis of the dominant modes of temperature and salinity (T - S) variability within these water masses. Climate signals are detected and analysed as they get transmitted into the interior from the water mass formation regions. Eastward propagating wavenumber-1, -2, and -3 signals are identied using a complex empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) analysis along the core of the AAIW layer. Variability in air-sea heat uxes and ice meltwater rates are shown by heat and salt budget analyses to control variability of Antarctic Surface Water where density surfaces associated with AAIW outcrop. The dominant mode in the CDW layer is found to exhibit an interbasin-scale of variability originating from the North Atlantic, and propagating southward into the Southern Ocean. Salinity dipole anomalies appear to propagate around the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation with the strengthening and weakening of North Atlantic Deep Water formation. In the AABW layer, T - S anomalies are shown to originate from the southwestern Weddell Sea, driven by salinity variations and convective overturning in the region. It is also demonstrated that the model exhibits spatial patterns of T - S variability for the most part consistent with limited observational record in the Southern Hemisphere. However, some observations of decadal T - S changes are found to be beyond that seen in the model in its unperturbed state. We further assess sea surface temperature (SST) variability modes in the Indian Ocean on interannual time scales  in the CSIRO model and in reanalysis data. The emergence of a meridional SST dipole during years of southwest Western Australian rainfall extremes is shown to be connected to a large-scale mode of Indian Ocean climate variability. The evolution of the dipole is controlled by variations in atmospheric circulation driving anomalous latent heat uxes with wind-driven ocean transport moderating the impact of evaporation and setting the conditions favourable for the next generation phase of an opposite dipole.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Climatic changes -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Ocean-atmosphere interaction -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ownership, organizational politics and information systems</field><field name="creator">Hart, Dennis, Computer Science, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The development of information systems and information management continue to present considerable challenges for many organizations, and more often than not for reason other than technological ones. Politically sensitive issues that are frequently raised by and bound up in such matters are an important cause of difficulties. This thesis proposes that perceptions of ownership of business processes and data by various groups within an organization can be a potent contributing factor in the occurrence of such political troubles. The thesis uses the new concept of information wards to develop a graphical model that links the scope of system development or organizational change and ownership perceptions to the likelihood of political difficulties. It then explores the links to organizational theory. The applicability and usefulness of the model is then argued through its application to a variety of case drawn from the information systems literature as well as case study project that provided the initial stimulus for the model???s development. It is shown that the model is capable of providing a variable explanation of the occurrence or absence of political troubles in the cases investigated. A prototype specialized group support system called Info*Warder based on the model has been built and is described in some detail. The software allows representative of organizational stakeholders to stake claims to business processes and data that are within the scope of systems development or change proposals, with the intention of permitting early detection of differences of opinion and potential conflicts. The thesis describes a research study in which the Info*Warder software was trialled within three Australia State Government departments. These departments were undergoing significant change both in their roles and information systems support arrangements and provided a useful test for the model and software. While the test was an indicative one only, it nevertheless showed that the software and its underlying theoretical model have the potential to assist in clarifying ownership issues related to information management and systems development in organizations, thereby helping to resolve them. Lastly, the thesis assesses how the developed model and software might fit into representative existing techniques and methodologies.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information systems</field><field name="subject">Organizational politics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mobilising action through management email texts: the negotiation of evaluative stance through choices in discourse and grammar</field><field name="creator">Wee, Constance Wei-Ling, Languages &amp; Linguistics, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with explicating the role of language in mobilising action through management emails. Situated within the context of organisational change in a globalised manufacturing business, the project is framed by behavioural observations from management scholars Palmer and Hardy (2000) of mobilisation strategies that utilise linguistic resources since they: (a) involve a sense of obligation or inclination in directives; (b) show how co-operation will produce mutual benefits; (c) construct desired actions as legitimate, beneficial or inevitable; and (d) use past or anticipated meanings, for or against certain actions. Systemic Functional Linguistics is the underlying framework employed to provide a theoretically principled account of the intuitively derived observations from Palmer and Hardy (2000) which are applied to a sample of twenty-seven email texts, through corpus- and text-based analysis. A major finding is that the representation of action is enacted interpersonally through the verbal group. This view complements experientially dominated accounts of the verbal group which focus on the tense system.  Further, action is found to be motivated through the negotiation of evaluative stance. By relating the grammar of the verbal group as well as other resources to the discourse semantics of Appraisal, modulation (of obligation or inclination) is found to be enabled by both negative as well as positive judgements of capacity. Specifically, judgements of capacity are re-interpreted as invocations of high obligation as managers seek to mobilise (further) positive performance. The analysis demonstrates that elements in the verbal group (complex) and Appraisal co-opt action through enabling positioning of the writer, in terms of assessing and grading categorical meanings, manipulating interpersonal time, or foregrounding solidarity. A significant contribution to the thesis is an extension of the system of GRADUATION: FOCUS (Hood, 2004a) through the demonstration of how resources of the verbal group negotiate expectations of appearances and achievements. This study has also extended the resources of GRADUATION: FORCE by applying it to the management context.  The practical contribution of the study is that these insights may more explicitly inform management training and enable managers to participate more effectively within their community of practice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Systemic functional linguistics</field><field name="subject">Email texts, Palmer and Hardy (2000)</field><field name="subject">Evaluative stance</field><field name="subject">Discourse</field><field name="subject">Grammar</field><field name="subject">Negotiation</field><field name="subject">Appraisal theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Roles of activation transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and YrdC in the response of vascular smooth muscle cells to injury</field><field name="creator">Malabanan, Kristine Paz, Centre for Vascular Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Neointimal proliferation is a key process underlying many cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and angioplasty-induced restenosis. Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) are significant contributors to the development and stability of the neointimal lesion. This is due, in part, to their capacity to be phenotypically modulated, facilitating SMC proliferation in response to mechanical injury, their subsequent migration, and deposition of extracellular matrix. The aim of this thesis was to characterize the function of two genes identified in our laboratory to be upregulated shortly after mechanical injury of vascular SMC and their exposure to fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, an injury-induced cytokine.  The first is activation transcription factor (ATF) 4, which is upregulated by FGF-2 and mechanical injury in vascular SMC in vitro, and by balloon-injury in the artery wall. The induction of ATF4 by FGF-2 was shown to be mediated through the PI3K pathway, and preceded by phoshorylation of eIF2alpha, a known upstream effector of ATF4 activation. Knock-down of ATF4 expression inhibited balloon-injury induced neointimal hyperplasia, suggesting that ATF4 is a key player in the SMC response to injury. Furthermore, microarray analysis identified several genes whose transcription in response to FGF-2 may be regulated by ATF4. In particular, this work demonstrates that ATF4 is necessary for VEGF-A upregulation in SMC in response to FGF-2 and mechanical injury in vitro and in the artery wall following balloon-injury.  The second is a translation factor, YrdC203. Using confocal fluorescence microscopy, YrdC203 was found to localize partially to the ER, and with RPL12, a component of the 60S ribosomal subunit. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that YrdC203 also interacts with an initiation factor, eIF5B. Mutation of an initiation factor&#146;s signature on the exterior of YrdC203 perturbed its interaction with RPL12 and eIF5B, and inhibited the increase in protein synthesis observed with overexpression of YrdC203. This implicates YrdC203 as a translation factor responsible for ensuring protein synthesis in vascular SMC in response to injury.  The present work provides evidence for new molecular mechanisms, transcriptional and translational, regulating the response of vascular SMC to injury. This would provide leads for future therapeutic targets.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">YrdC</field><field name="subject">vascular smooth muscle cell injury</field><field name="subject">ATF4</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cosmology with the Lyman alpha forest</field><field name="creator">Liske, Jochen, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis we investigate the large-scale distribution of Ly alpha forest absorption, the effect of ionizing radiation from QSOs on their surrounding intergalactic medium and the primordial abundance of deuterium.  We develop a new technique for detecting structure on Mpc scales in the Ly alpha forest. This technique does not rely on identifying individual absorption lines but is rather based on the statistics of the transmitted flux. We demonstrate that the new method is significantly more sensitive to the presence of large-scale structure in the Ly alpha forest than a two-point correlation function analysis. We apply this method to 2 A resolution spectra of ten QSOs which cover the redshift range 2.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.4. The QSOs form a closely spaced group on the sky and are concentrated within a 1-deg^2 field. We find evidence for large-scale structure in the distribution of Ly alpha forest absorption at the &gt; 99 per cent confidence level. Along the line of sight we find overdense Ly alpha absorption on scales of up to 1200 km s^-1. There is also strong evidence for correlated absorption across line of sight pairs separated by &lt; 3 h^-1 Mpc. For larger separations the cross-correlation signal becomes progressively less significant.  Using the same technique and dataset we confirm the existence of the proximity effect. We derive a value for the mean intensity of the extragalactic background radiation at the Lyman limit of J = (3.6^+3.5_-1.3) x 10^-22 ergs s^-1 cm^-2 Hz^-1 sr^-1. This value assumes that QSO redshifts measured from high ionization lines differ from the true systemic redshifts by Delta v = 800 km s^-1. Allowing for known QSO variability we find evidence at a level of 2.1 sigma that the significance of the proximity effect is correlated with QSO Lyman limit luminosity.  From the complete sample we find no evidence for the existence of a foreground proximity effect, implying either that J &gt; 20 x 10^-22 ergs s^-1 cm^-2 Hz^-1 sr^-1 or that QSOs emit at least a factor of 1.4 less ionizing radiation in the plane of the sky than along the line of sight to Earth. We do, however, find one counter-example where a foreground QSO apparently depletes the absorbing gas in four surrounding lines of sight.  We discuss the feasibility of pre-selecting absorption systems from low resolution data for a measurement of the primordial deuterium abundance. We present a new, low resolution spectroscopic survey of 101 high redshift QSOs aimed at identifying candidate D/H systems. We further present an echelle spectrum of a Lyman limit system at z = 2.917. We find that this system is most likely heavily contaminated and does not yield an interesting limit on D/H.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cosmology</field><field name="subject">Lyman alpha forest</field><field name="subject">intergalactic medium</field><field name="subject">extragalactic UV background</field><field name="subject">deuterium abundance</field><field name="subject">quasars</field><field name="subject">absorption spectra</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17870</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applying the "safe place, safe person, safe systems" framework to improve OHS management: a new integrated approach</field><field name="creator">Makin, Anne-Marie, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A new model was developed to enhance the understanding of the full context of work associated hazards, to explore the connection between OHS performance and a systematic approach to safety, and to simplify approaches to OHS management. This Safe Place, Safe Person, Safe Systems model was derived from the literature and used as the basis for the development of a framework, consisting of 60 elements which was transformed into an assessment tool. This assessment tool was trialled with a pilot study on a medium sized manufacturing plant in the plastics industry, and the tool and Preliminary Report peer reviewed by an expert panel using the Nominal Group Technique. After refinements were made to the assessment tool it was applied to eight case studies that were drawn from advertisements. This qualitative study consisted of two parts: firstly the assessment using the Safe Place, Safe Person, Safe Systems framework; and secondly a controlled self assessment exercise to target improvements to three of the elements over a period of four months. The study illustrated that the Safe Place, Safe Person, Safe Systems framework could be successfully applied in a range of industries to promote OHS improvements and to provide a systematic, planned approach to fulfilling OHS responsibilities. The application of this framework highlighted that: there is a need for further education on the correct application of the risk assessment process and the responsibilities owed to contractors; techniques such as dynamic risk assessments are more suitable where the place of work is variable and hazards are unpredictable; more focus is needed on the appropriate management of hazardous substances with long term health consequences; and that the level of formality invoked for treating hazards does not necessarily equate to improved risk reduction outcomes. The Safe Place, Safe Person, Safe Systems framework was found to be applicable to small, medium and large organisations provided the assessment was scoped to a small division of relatively homogeneous activity to ensure a more representative hazard profile. This approach has provided a way forward to simplify OHS management and also offers practical direction for implementing a targeted OHS improvement program.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Safe person.</field><field name="subject">OHS management.</field><field name="subject">Safe place.</field><field name="subject">Safe systems.</field><field name="subject">Safe place, safe person, safe systems framework.</field><field name="subject">Dynamic risk assessments.</field><field name="subject">OHS in small to medium enterprises.</field><field name="subject">Barriers to OHS implementation.</field><field name="subject">Risk reduction factor.</field><field name="subject">Simplified OHS management.</field><field name="subject">Safety management.</field><field name="subject">OHS risk management.</field><field name="subject">Multiple case studies.</field><field name="subject">Qualitative approach.</field><field name="subject">OHS management systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NMR spectroscopic studies of binding and exchange in rhenium alkane complexes</field><field name="creator">Lawes, Douglas John, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The transition metal complexes cyclopentadienylrhenium tricarbonyl [CpRe(CO)3, Cp = cyclopentadienyl] and (isopropylcyclopentadienyl)rhenium tricarbonyl [(i-PrCp)Re(CO)3, i-Pr = isopropyl] were photolysed in alkanes at low temperature and the resulting alkane complexes, of the general formula Cp'Re(CO)2(alkane) (Cp' = Cp or (i-PrCp)), were studied using NMR spectroscopy. Characteristic proton chemical shifts (&#948;) and couplings (3JHH) were observed for alkane complexes of several linear, branched and cyclic alkanes of up to eight carbons. Alkanes with chemically distinct methyl (CH3) and/or methylene (CH2) units were observed alternatively binding through each unit to rhenium. No bound methine unit was observed. Large C-H coupling constants (1JCH) were observed for protons of several bound CH3 and CH2 units, indicating the bound C-H is intact. These species are, thus, alkane sigma (&#963;) complexes, wherein the alkane has an agostic (M-H-C, 3 centre 2 electron) interaction with the rhenium centre.  The CH3 binding mode of (i-PrCp)Re(CO)2(1-pentane) was elucidated; sequential deuteration in the bound CH3 revealed an equilibrium isotope effect (EIE) in the remaining proton/s, confirming that only one C-H has an agostic interaction with rhenium at any instant . NMR parameters &#948;(1H) (-8.22), &#948;(13C) ( 42.4) and 1JCH (85 Hz) for the complexed C-H reveal it is unequivocally intact and yet strongly interacting with the rhenium centre, hallmarks for the agostic interaction.  Intramolecular exchange was identified between pentane complex isomers Cp'Re(CO)2(1-pentane), Cp'Re(CO)2(2-pentane) and Cp'Re(CO)2(3-pentane). Equilibrium constants were determined, revealing a preference for CH2 binding over CH3.  The inequivalent hydrogens found in methylene groups of cyclohexane at low temperature permitted simultaneous observation of axial and equatorial C-H protons of a bound CH2 in CpRe(CO)2(cyclohexane); an EIE, upon deuteration, indicated rapid exchange between complexed C-H bonds in the bound CH2 unit. The rhenium centre was found to prefer complexation of the axial C-H bond, over the equatorial, with K ~2.9.  Intermolecular exchange of alkane ligands with free solvent was directly observed, in the competitive complexation of the [CpRe(CO)2] fragment to different alkanes in binary mixtures. The preference cyclohexane &gt; cyclopentane &gt; pentane &gt; isobutane was established and equilibrium constants determined. The kinetics were followed by NMR and modelled, revealing rate constants; decay rates were also determined.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agostic</field><field name="subject">alkane complex</field><field name="subject">sigma complex</field><field name="subject">rhenium</field><field name="subject">NMR</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forgetting in logic programs</field><field name="creator">Wong, Ka-Shu, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Forgetting is an operation which removes information from a set of logical statements, such that a) the language used by the logic is simplified; and b) as much information as possible from the original logical statements are preserved. Forgetting operations are useful in a variety of contexts, including knowledge representation, where it is necessary to have an operation for removing information from knowledge bases; and the problem of relevance, where logical statements are simplified by removing irrelevant information. In this thesis we consider forgetting operations on logic programs with negation-as-failure according to the stable model semantics.  There are existing notions of forgetting on logic programs in the literature: the strong forgetting and weak forgetting of Zhang and Foo, and the semantic approach to forgetting introduced by Wang et al. However, these notions are inadequate: the strong and weak forgettings are defined syntactically with no obvious connections to semantic notions of forgetting; while the semantic approach of Wang et al. does not take into account ``hidden'' information encoded in unused rules.  The idea of equivalence on logic programs capture the extent of information contained in a logic program. We consider that two logic programs are equivalent iff the two programs contain the same information. For logic programs, there are many different possible notions of equivalence. We look at the well-known notion of strong equivalence and a new notion of equivalence which we call T-equivalence. Associated with each of these equivalences is a consequence relation on logic program rules. We present sound and complete set of inference rules for both consequence relations.  We present a novel approach to logic program forgetting which uses as its basis a set of postulates, which are defined relative to a notion of equivalence. We show that if we use T-equivalence as the equivalence relation, then the only possible forgetting operations (up to equivalence) are strong forgetting and weak forgetting. If strong equivalence is used instead, then there are also only two possible forgetting operations (up to equivalence).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Belief revision.</field><field name="subject">Logic programming.</field><field name="subject">Forgetting.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Institutionalisation of integrated urban stormwater management: multiple-case analysis of local management reform across metropolitan Sydney</field><field name="creator">Brown, Rebekah Ruth, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation contributes to advancing the institutionalisation of integrated urban stormwater management in pursuit of sustainable urban water environments. It is now accepted that traditional approaches to managing urban stormwater environments are unsustainable and that integrated approaches reflecting an ecosystem-based approach need to be mobilised. However, the implementation of this approach in practice remains consistently problematic. Impediments are hypothesised to be related to the administrative inertia of local management practices. This hypothesis is investigated through a multiple-case study of eight local government organisations in Metropolitan Sydney by applying the following research question ??? what factors generate institutional capacity in local government for facilitating integrated urban stormwater management?  Between mid-1999 and mid-2001 a state government program designed to reform local urban stormwater management practice chiefly through the collaborative preparation of integrated catchment management plans, provided an opportunity to collect empirical data on the capacities needed for facilitating an integrated management approach. Analysis of the program implementation revealed that this capacity could be measured in terms of a local management dynamic involving three mutually interdependent spheres of activity including the role of the stormwater officer, the intra-organisational context and the inter-organisational context.  The capacities important for facilitating a successful integrated urban stormwater management practice were found to relate to the capacity for organisational and cross-sectoral interaction as opposed to being mobilised by a top-down regulatory intervention. For this local organisational interaction the particular capacities of the local stormwater officer that were demonstrated to be important included the ability to facilitate an action-learning environment, relationship building and negotiation between players across the catchment. For the intra-organisational context it was essential that the organisation had political commitment to the management of the urban water environment as expressed through departmental management systems, a dedicated interdepartmental policy committee and dedicated organisational resources. For the inter-organisational context it was clearly demonstrated that the successful cases prioritised building and maintaining active relationships between organisations around environmental management. Based on these results a formative framework for the development of future local management capacity building methodologies concludes the dissertation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23886</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MOBMAS - A methodology for ontology-based multi-agent systems development</field><field name="creator">Tran, Quynh Nhu, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">???Agent-based systems are one of the most vibrant and important areas of research and development to have emerged in information technology in the 1990s??? (Luck et al. 2003). The use of agents as a metaphor for designing and constructing software systems represents an innovative movement in the field of software engineering: ???Agent- Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE)??? (Lind 2000; Luck et al. 2003). This research contributes to the evolution of AOSE by proposing a comprehensive ontology-based methodology for the analysis and design of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). The methodology is named MOBMAS, which stands for ???Methodology for Ontology-Based MASs???. A major improvement of MOBMAS over the existing agentoriented MAS development methodologies is its explicit and extensive support for ontology-based MAS development. Ontologies have been widely acknowledged for their significant benefits to interoperability, reusability, MAS development activities (such as system analysis and agent knowledge modelling) and MAS operation (such as agent communication and reasoning). Recognising these desirable ontology???s benefits, MOBMAS endeavours to identify and implement the various ways in which ontologies can be used in the MAS development process and integrated into the MAS model definitions. In so doing, MOBMAS has exploited ontologies to enhance its MAS development process and MAS development product with various strengths. These strengths include those ontology???s benefits listed above, and those additional benefits uncovered by MOBMAS, e.g. support for verification and validation, extendibility, maintainability and reliability. Compared to the numerous existing agent-oriented methodologies, MOBMAS is the first that explicitly and extensively investigates the diverse potential advantages of ontologies in MAS development, and which is able to implement these potential advantages via an ontology-based MAS development process and a set of ontology-based MAS model definitions. Another major contribution of MOBMAS to the field of AOSE is its ability to address all key concerns of MAS development in one methodological framework. The methodology provides support for a comprehensive list of methodological requirements,  which are important to agent-oriented analysis and design, but which may not be wellsupported by the current methodologies. These methodological requirements were identified and validated by this research from three sources: the existing agent-oriented methodologies, the existing evaluation frameworks for agent-oriented methodologies and conventional system development methodologies, and a survey of practitioners and researchers in the field of AOSE. MOBMAS supports the identified methodological requirements by combining the strengths of the existing agent-oriented methodologies (i.e. by reusing and enhancing the various strong techniques and model definitions of the existing methodologies where appropriate), and by proposing new techniques and model definitions where necessary. The process of developing MOBMAS consisted of three sequential research activities. The first activity identified and validated a list of methodological requirements for an Agent Oriented Software Engineering methodology as mentioned above. The second research activity developed MOBMAS by specifying a development process, a set of techniques and a set of model definitions for supporting the identified methodological requirements. The final research activity evaluated and refined MOBMAS by collecting expert reviews on the methodology, using the methodology on an application and conducting a feature analysis of the methodology.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intelligent agents (Computer software)</field><field name="subject">Software engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entrepreneurs and organisations: a case study of the Gisborne aquaculture cluster</field><field name="creator">Johnstone, Bruce Alexander</field><field name="description">This research contributes to the discussion surrounding New Zealand&#8217;s entrepreneurial environment and Innovation Framework and addresses the research problem of whether the New Zealand government should seek to support entrepreneurship and innovation through the various knowledge-based or regulatory organisations it owns or funds, and if so, how it should go about accomplishing this. The approach taken was to use qualitative methods to examine how the government&#8217;s support for entrepreneurship and innovation was delivered to an emerging cluster of entrepreneurs from the point of view of those entrepreneurs.  The entrepreneurs were involved in the innovative industry of land-based aquaculture and fieldwork was carried out in the Gisborne Region, on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand. This study began by reviewing relevant literature from academic, industry and government sources to identify relevant sub-themes and create a framework for analysis. Fieldwork was undertaken using ethnographic methods to explore how the entrepreneurs experienced the New Zealand entrepreneurial environment and innovation framework in their interactions with knowledge-based and regulatory organisations. Data was gathered primarily by participant observation and semi-structured interviews and transcripts were coded and analysed using NVivo&#174; software. An ethnographic narrative was produced and the interview transcripts analysed for relevance to the sub-themes from literature and to identify patterns that emerged from the data. This research reports that four of the entrepreneurs failed in their ventures due to a combination of factors both within their operations and within the entrepreneurial environment. These factors included technical difficulties maintaining livestock health and growth within an artificial marine environment, an inability to obtain assistance from knowledge-based organisations, problems in dealing with regulatory organisations, difficulty retaining trained staff, uncertainty about the market, and high energy costs. The M&#257;ori training organisation, Turanga Ararau, formed the Gisborne Aquaculture Society in an effort to establish a Gisborne aquaculture cluster however, this initiative proved unsuccessful primarily because the society failed to attract the 12 involvement of key stakeholders. This research contributes to the policy and practice of cluster facilitation by examining the extent to which best practice was followed in this attempt to establish a cluster and presents conclusions as to how the process of establishing the cluster could have been improved. This study also reports that the entrepreneurs were cut off from access to knowledge and research resources and received little advice or support from the knowledge based organisations that might have played a role in the development of their cluster. It examines how and why New Zealand&#8217;s Innovation Framework might be failing to recognise and support the vital role of entrepreneurs in economic development and suggests how this might be improved. The methodology chapters of this thesis contribute to literature regarding the use of ethnographic methods in entrepreneurship research and a further by-product of this thesis is an ethnographic account of the participant observation and semi structured interviews with the entrepreneurs. This research also provides an insight into the obstacles and challenges faced by entrepreneurs in New Zealand, in particular those involved in the emerging recirculating aquaculture industry.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entrepreneur</field><field name="subject">Ethnography</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">Fish farming</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of acute and periodic stretching interventions on knee extension range of motion and hamstring muscle extensibility in individuals with osteoarthritis of the knee</field><field name="creator">Reid, Duncan</field><field name="description">Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a common condition. The condition causes pain and swelling in the knee joint and as a consequence knee range of motion, particularly knee extension, can be decreased. While a number of studies have indicated increases in knee extension range of motion (ROM) can be achieved following stretching interventions, these studies have been undertaken in young healthy populations mostly. To date, there have been no investigations of stretching as a single intervention in people with OA knee.  Review of Literature: To gain an appreciation of the literature in this area, three structured literature reviews were undertaken. The first examined the efficacy of acute stretching interventions on lower limb joint ROM in young and elderly subjects, the second examined the efficacy of periodic muscle stretching interventions on lower limb joint ROM in elderly subjects and the third examined the efficacy of periodic muscle stretching interventions on ROM in subjects with OA of the knee joint. The results of the first review indicated that there is strong evidence for acute stretching interventions to increase joint ROM in the lower limb of young and elderly subjects. The results of the second review indicated that there is strong evidence for periodic stretching interventions to increase joint ROM in the lower limb of elderly subjects. The result of the third review indicated that there is limited evidence for stretching interventions alone to improve ROM in the lower limb in subjects with OA of the knee joint. As consequence of these findings two studies were designed to investigate the effects of acute and periodic stretching in people with OA of the knee joint. Study 1 Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of an acute hamstring-stretching programme on knee extension range of motion in individuals with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee and compare them to individuals of a similar age without OA of the knee. Study Design: A cross sectional study design was used. Participants: Thirty one subjects (16 male and 15 female) with OA of the knee were recruited from the local population (mean age 67.8 yrs SD: 5.0, mass 81.4 kg, SD: 15.2, height 168.5 cm, SD 11.1). Thirty one subjects of a similar age (9 male and 23 female) were also recruited who were otherwise fit and healthy and did not have OA of the knee (mean age 68.8 yrs SD: 5.2, mass 71.4 kg, SD: 13.2, height 163.8 cm, SD 8.1). Method: Hamstring extensibility was assessed by a passive knee extension test using a Kincom&#174; isokinetic dynamometer. Subjects undertook two trials of maximum knee extension. The Kincom&#174; then stretched the hamstrings to a point determined as 80% of the initial maximum knee extension test. Three sets of 60 seconds stretching were undertaken with 60 seconds rest between sets. Two further maximal knee extension tests were performed after the stretching intervention. The variables of interests were maximal knee extension, peak passive torque and stiffness. Analysis: A 2-factor repeated measures ANOVA model was utilised. The alpha level was set at 0.05. Results: There was a significant main effect by time for knee extension ROM, peak passive torque and stiffness (p&lt;0.05). There was no interaction effect between groups across time (p&gt;0.05). Knee extension range of motion (ROM) in the OA group increased significantly from 75.6 (SD: 17.2) degrees to 80.5 (SD: 22.3) degrees after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). Subjects in the non OA group increased significantly from 77.5 (SD: 15.5) degrees to 81.9 (SD: 18.2) degrees after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). The knee extension ROM recorded at 50% of the peak torque level pre intervention for the OA group was 60.3 (SD: 18.7) degrees and this increased significantly to 67.2 (SD 16.7) degrees post intervention (p&lt;0.05). For the non OA group, knee extension ROM at 50% of peak torque increased significantly from 60.1 (SD: 15.2) degrees to 65.8 (SD 16.0) degrees (p&lt;0.05). Peak passive torque in the OA group increased significantly from 18.1 (SD: 9.6) Nm to 22.5 (SD: 12.9) Nm after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). Subjects in the non OA group increased significantly from 21.05 (SD: 11.6) Nm to 22.05 (SD: 12.8) Nm after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). For stiffness, there was a significant interaction effect (p &lt;0.05) between groups across time. The OA group increased significantly from 0.70 (SD: 0.35) Nm/deg to 0.89 (SD: 0.5) Nm/deg after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). Subjects in the non OA group increased significantly 0.78 (SD: 0.36) Nm/deg to 0.82 (SD: 0.42) Nm/deg after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: The study demonstrated that knee extension ROM, passive resistive torque and stiffness increased with a single bout of stretching. These results indicate that both elderly subjects and those with degenerative joint disease are able to demonstrate immediate tissue adaptations with acute stretching interventions. This is important as clinicians often prescribe acute stretching exercises in the preparation for other activities such as strengthening and walking programmes. Improving joint range of motion prior to other subsequent activities may be beneficial to those people with OA in particular, as management guidelines for these populations recommend regular exercise to reduce the deterioration of the condition. Study 2 Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a six week stretching intervention to the key muscles of the lower limb, in people with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee joint and compare them to individuals of a similar age without OA of the knee. A 12 week follow up was undertaken to see if these effects were maintained following the intervention. This study builds on the effects of an acute stretching intervention as demonstrated in Study 1. Study Design: A randomised control trial design was used. Participants: Forty three subjects (24 OA and 19 non OA) were recruited from the local population (mean age 68.8 yrs SD: 5.0, mass 79.5 kg, SD: 14.6, height 166 cm, SD 9.8). Subjects were randomly allocated by condition to either a stretch group or a control group. Methods: Hamstring extensibility was assessed by a passive knee extension test using a Kincom&#174; isokinetic dynamometer at baseline, following the intervention and at a 12 week follow-up. Subjects in the intervention groups stretched the main lower limb muscles 3 x 60 seconds, 5 days a week for 6 weeks. The control groups did not stretch but received a placebo intervention of interferential current. The variables of interest were maximal knee extension, peak passive torque and stiffness. The following outcome measures were also used to assess activity levels: the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), the Lower Limb Task Questionnaire (LLTQ) and the Aggregated Locomotor Functional (ALF) score. Analysis: A 3-factor (group x condition x time) repeated measures ANOVA model was utilised. The alpha level was set at 0.05. Results: There was a significant main effect for time and a significant interaction effect for group (stretch and control) by time for knee extension ROM, peak passive torque and stiffness (p&lt;0.05). There was no significant interaction for condition (OA vs non OA) (p&gt;0.05). Subjects in the stretch group had 68.9 (SD: 15.5) degrees of knee extension before the intervention and this increased significantly to 76.8 (SD: 14.4) degrees after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). At the 12 week follow up assessment, subjects had a mean of 72.5 (SD: 20.51) degrees. This difference was not significant when compared to the post intervention assessment (p&gt;0.05). Subjects in the control group were not significantly different for knee extension ROM following the intervention or at the 12 week follow up (p&gt;0.05). For the knee extension ROM at 50% of the maximum torque level, there was a significant main effect for time (p&lt;0.05) but no significant interaction effect between groups across time (p &gt;0.05). The mean knee extension ROM recorded at 50% of the peak torque level for the stretch group pre intervention was 55.9 (SD: 15.0) degrees and this decreased significantly to 50.8 (SD 12.3) degrees post intervention (p&lt;0.05). The mean knee extension ROM recorded at 50% of the peak torque level pre intervention for the control group was 60.2 (SD: 11.4) degrees and this decreased significantly to 57.1 (SD 11.0) degrees post intervention (p&lt;0.05).  With respect to peak passive torque subjects in the stretch group were 13.2 (SD: 7.7) Nm before the intervention and increased significantly to 19.7 (SD: 9.5) Nm after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). At the 12 week follow up assessment, the subjects in the stretch group generated a mean peak torque of 20.2 (SD: 11.5) Nm. This difference was not significant when compared to the post intervention assessment (p&gt;0.05).   With respect to stiffness, subjects in the stretch group were 0.62 (SD: 0.3) Nm/deg before the intervention and this increased significantly to 0.84 (SD: 0.3) Nm/deg after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). At the 12 week follow up time point, the subjects in the stretch group had a mean stiffness of 0.88 (SD: 11.5) Nm/deg. This increase was not significant when compared to the post intervention assessment (p&gt;0.05). Subjects in the control group were not significantly different for peak passive torque or stiffness following the intervention or at the 12 week follow up. There was no significant difference for time or condition for the WOMAC or LLTQ scores. There was a significant main effect for time for both groups for the ALF score (p&lt;0.05), however there was no significant interaction for time by condition (p&gt;0.05). Subjects in the stretch group had a mean ALF score of 23.1 (SD: 3.9) seconds pre intervention and this reduced significantly to 19.8 (SD: 5.4) seconds post intervention (p&lt;0.05). Subjects in the control group had a mean AFL score of 24.8 (SD: 3.1) seconds pre intervention and this reduced significantly to 22.3 (SD: 3.0) seconds post intervention (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: The study demonstrated that knee extension range of motion, peak passive torque and stiffness increased in those subjects who undertook the six week stretching programme. Knee extension ROM was not maintained at the 12 week follow up assessment, however peak passive torque and stiffness were. These results indicate that both elderly subjects and those with degenerative joint disease are able to demonstrate long term adaptations with periodic stretching interventions. Functional improvements were also observed following the intervention in the stretch groups and the control groups. As previous studies investigating exercise interventions in subjects with OA of the knee joint have combined stretching and strengthening exercises, this study has provided a clear picture of the effects of stretching alone in this population. However, to gain a more obvious change in function in subjects with OA of the knee joint, the combination of stretching with other exercises such as strengthening, may be required in future studies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flexibility</field><field name="subject">Arthritis</field><field name="subject">Electromyography</field><field name="subject">Randomisaton and blinding</field><field name="subject">Stiff joints</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epicardial pacing in New Zealand (1977-2002)</field><field name="creator">Searby, Karen Ann</field><field name="description">Reviews of clinical practice for paediatric pacemaker implantation and follow-up are necessary to provide an evidence-base for future policy and practice in this field. Epicardial pacing data available through Green Lane Hospital, New Zealand's (NZ) primary referral centre for paediatric cardiac surgery and pacemaker implantation, was reviewed with the following aims:  Assessment of pacemaker lead performance over time in relation to the type of epicardial lead implanted - steroid-eluting (SE) and non steroid-eluting (NSE).  Determination of the survival rate of epicardial leads. Identifying factors predicting or associated with lead failure.A database of pacing and sensing thresholds and lead impedance data at implant, 2, 6 and 18 weeks and 6 monthly intervals thereafter, was compiled and the prevalence and timing of complications in relation to lead type, location and implant route determined. In total 192 leads (155 SE, 37 NSE) were implanted in 96 patients (52 male) aged 3 days to 71 years (y) (median 1.7y), 74 patients were &lt; 17 years of age at implant. Congenital heart defects were present in 82% of patients. Follow-up (f/u) was possible for 180 leads. Mean f/u duration for the 150 SE leads was 3.1y (2 weeks - 8.8y) and for the 30 NSE leads was 4.5y (2 weeks - 27y).SE and NSE pacing thresholds were similar at implant. NSE pacing thresholds peaked at 6 weeks post implant and remained significantly higher than SE leads throughout f/u in surviving leads, although the difference was small at 2 and 4 y. SE and NSE leads had similar ventricular sensing thresholds and lead impedances throughout the study period.Survival at 5 years for all leads was 61% (66% for SE leads and 41% for NSE leads). Primary causes of failure in the leads receiving f/u were exit block and lead fracture. The occurrence of exit block was significantly higher (p&lt;0.0001) in NSE leads (57%) compared to SE leads (5%). Lead fracture occurred in 15% of leads with the highest fracture rate at 2-3 y post implant. Patient age and weight at implant, gender, previous cardiac surgery, lead polarity, indication for pacing and implant route were not predictors of lead failure. NSE leads were 6 times more likely to fail compared to SE leads (p &lt;0.0001).The main study findings were: SE leads maintain lower pacing thresholds and a reduced incidence of exit block compared to NSE leads. It is therefore recommended that SE leads be developed which can penetrate fibrosed, scarred or fatty epicardial surfaces. Where SE lead use is contraindicated, alternative surgical techniques for SE lead placement should be attempted rather than implanting NSE leads. Lead fracture is a significant complication of epicardial pacing in paediatric patients. Using stronger bipolar leads implanted by the subxiphoid route may reduce the risk of fracture. Medium term survival (5 y) of SE epicardial leads is acceptable and therefore the continued use of these leads is recommended, particularly in young patients, allowing their veins to be saved for transvenous leads later in their life.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiac pacemakers</field><field name="subject">Cardiac pacing</field><field name="subject">Cardiac Pacing, Artificial</field><field name="subject">Exercise Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/54</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of game specific task constraints on the outcome of the water polo shot</field><field name="creator">Wende, Katrina van der</field><field name="description">Recent research has highlighted that information-movement couplings are unique to the constraints of the task, environment and performer. This recent research implies that skills should be developed in practice environments that are reflective of those found in competition. Representative environments should also allow the performer to attune to specifying information essential for success of a skill. However, in water polo, shooting practice is often conducted without the presence of a goalkeeper or defender. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of game-specific task constraints on the ball speed, accuracy and technique of the water polo shot. Ten male competitive level water polo players performed a total of forty shots comprising ten shots in each of four conditions from the 4m-penalty line. Conditions included all combinations of goalkeeper and defender (absent or present). Three Sony mini-digital cameras (50Hz) were placed perpendicular to the movement, giving rear, overhead and a right sagittal view. Ball speed was measured using a Radar-gun (Stalker Pro, USA). For each condition, means and standard deviations were determined for all outcome measures (shooting accuracy and ball speed) and technique variables. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine the effect (p&lt;0.05) of the goalkeeper and defender individually as well as in combination on the dependent variables. Cohen's effect sizes were also used to determine the magnitude of the difference between conditions. The presence of a defender resulted in a significant increase in lateral trunk flexion at ball release, decreased the duration of the shot and selected swing sub-phases (i.e. pick-up to top of back swing time) and significantly altered the placement of the ball in the goal. When the goalkeeper only was present, this resulted in decreases in total shot time and pick-up to top of back swing time and significantly altered the placement of the ball in the goal. The presence of the defender and goalkeeper in combination brought about a moderate effect, decreasing the ball speed, significantly decreasing the success of the shots, scores achieved and significantly altering the placement of shots. Forward swing distance and selected swing sub-phases (i.e. total shot time, pick-up to top of back swing time, forward swing start to midway and forward swing start to release) were also significantly decreased in the presence of the defender and goalkeeper. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining appropriate task constraints during water polo shooting practice. In effect the removal of the defender and goalkeeper leads to the development of inappropriate information-movement couplings. Specifically, the presence of the defender and/or goalkeeper lead to reductions in the durations of selected swing sub phases, resulting in changes in the relative coordination and timing of the water polo shot. These findings indicate that in order to facilitate the development of this specific shooting skill, coaches should structure practice to replicate the perceptual information available during competition.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Water polo</field><field name="subject">Sports - Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Biomechanics</field><field name="subject">Sport Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/98</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emotion and function: rethinking display and shelving</field><field name="creator">Leong, Kong Pei</field><field name="description">A product can embrace emotional qualities as well as functional qualities. Emotional qualities include fun, beauty, delight, surprise and any pleasure of the senses, such as sight, touch, smell, hearing and taste. In the literature of the past decade considerable emphasis has been placed on the less tangible emotional attributes a product conveys. Designing to satisfy human emotion has become one of the main design considerations for today's society. A product should not be designed to satisfy only the functional needs of the users but must also satisfy their psychological and emotional needs. This project is focused on exploring empathic design to develop an emotional display system to fulfil users' desires, aspirations and provide pleasurable experiences. Empathic design is an experience and emotion driven design that aims to enrich users' lifestyles, pride and pleasure, and adds value to the product. Five prototypes were evaluated through a questionnaire survey, focus groups and interviews regarding their emotional and functional qualities. While the resultant findings were not entirely conclusive, the evaluations have clearly indicated that the emotional qualities of a product are of significance to the users. Emotional qualities add pleasure and value to a product. Using these findings as design criteria, the designer proposes a series of new conceptual designs that are more empathic to the users' emotional needs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/164</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of water immersion, active recovery and passive recovery on repeated bouts of explosive exercise and blood plasma fraction</field><field name="creator">Wilcock, Ian</field><field name="description">Optimising recovery post-game or post-training could provide a competitive advantage to an athlete, especially if more than one bout of exercise is performed in a day. Active recovery is one common method that is thought to enhance the recovery process. Another recovery method that is gaining popularity is water immersion. The objective of this thesis was to analyse whether these two recovery methods provided greater recovery from explosive exercise than passive recovery. A physiological rationale that may explain the possibility of enhanced recovery with water immersion was initially investigated. The literature surrounding active recovery, water immersion and passive recovery on strength, cycling, running and jumping was then examined. Following these reviews an experimental study was conducted investigating the effects of water immersion, active recovery and passive recovery conducted after repeated bouts of explosive exercise. The rationale for active recovery post-exercise is that during intense exercise, fluid from the blood is forced into the working muscles due to the increase in mean arterial pressure, which increases muscle volume and decreases blood plasma fraction. Active recovery reduces this exercise induced edema and, with an associated increase in blood flow throughout the body, may increase the metabolism of waste substrates produced during exercise. Researchers have observed this increased substrate metabolism with reductions in post-exercise blood lactate accumulation following active recovery. Water immersion would appear to cause a similar physiological response to active recovery without the need to expend extra energy. When a large portion of the body is immersed, hydrostatic pressure acts on the body's fluids within the immersed region. Fluids from the extravascular space move into the vascular system reducing exercise-induced increases in muscular volume and reducing soft tissue inflammation. Additionally, blood volume increases and is redistributed towards the central cavity, which in turn increases cardiac preload, stroke volume, cardiac output, and blood flow throughout the body. Cardiac output increases in relation to the depth of immersion and have been observed to increase by as much as 102% during head-out immersions. These cardiovascular responses occur without any increase in energy expenditure. If extra-intravascular fluid movement is enhanced, then the movement and metabolism of waste substrates could increase. Observations of increased post-exercise blood lactate clearance with water immersion would support this theory. Most methodologies studying the performance benefits of active recovery and water immersion suffer many limitations. These limitations often consist of the experimental time schedule not replicating what is likely to occur in a practical situation, no isolation of water temperature and hydrostatic pressure effects, and lack of a sport-like exercise consisting of repeated expressions of explosive power. Light-intensity active recovery and water immersion do not appear to be detrimental to performance, but neither does there appear to be enough evidence to claim they are beneficial. Effects of active recovery and water immersion would seem to be trivial to small, with any benefits more likely following multiple bouts of high-intensity exercise and recovery or following muscle damaging exercise. There may be a link between blood plasma fraction and performance, however, evidence is inconclusive. Given these issues and limitations the aim of this research was to investigate whether combinations of active recovery, water immersion and passive recovery could maintain peak power and work during subsequent bouts of explosive exercise. We also investigated whether there was any difference in subjects' blood plasma faction and perceived fatigue between the recovery modes. A cross-over experiment was conducted on seven subjects over four weeks. On the same day of each week subjects performed three sessions of maximal jumping, each two hours apart, followed by a different recovery method. Each jump session consisted of three sets of 20 maximal jumps repeated every three seconds, with a minute's rest in-between. Immediately following the jumping subjects performed 10 minutes of either (A) active recovery on a cycle ergometer followed by seated rest, (I) immersion to the gluteal fold in 19&#176;C water followed by seated rest, (AI) active recovery followed by immersion, or (P) seated passive rest. Jumping was conducted on an instrumented supine squat machine that allowed the measurement of total peak power and total work. Pre-jump, post jump and post-recovery blood was taken and the percentage of blood plasma fraction calculated. Perceived leg fatigue was also measured at these times. Observed differences in total peak power and total work between the recovery modes were non-significant. No differences were observed in the change of blood plasma fraction between the recovery modes or perceived fatigue. One reason for any lack of difference between the recovery modes may have been the brevity of the recovery time. Research that has observed significant benefits of active recovery and water immersion compared to passive recovery have used recovery times greater of 15 minutes or more. Additionally, changes in blood plasma fraction between active recovery, water immersion and passive recovery have not been apparent until at least 10 minutes post-recovery in previous research. Alternatively, rather than brevity, it may be that active recovery or water immersion simply does not provide any benefit to performance recovery. Overall there is a meagre amount of research into active recovery, water immersion and passive recovery. Further research that incorporates a variety of exercise and recovery protocols is required.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exercise - Physiological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Blood plasma.</field><field name="subject">Aquatic exercises - Therapeutic use.</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of diet and physical activity on the markers of oxidative stress</field><field name="creator">Migriauli, Lela</field><field name="description">Lifestyle diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, cancer, type 2 diabetes are the major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The prevalence of these diseases is high in New Zealand as well. It is believed that promoting a healthy diet and increased physical activity can make beneficial changes and extend the healthy life expectancy. This twelve week study with follow-up at 52 weeks was designed to demonstrate if a diet and physical activity group intervention in the workplace would result in changes in risk factors for antioxidant damage and therefore reduce the risk for lifestyle diseases. The effect of the addition of kiwifruit to the diet on markers of oxidative stress was also measured in a crossover sub study within this study. Fifty two healthy subjects (male 24, female 28, mean age 46), completed the 12 week study with measurements points being at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks. Thirty eight subjects presented for another set of measurements at 52 weeks. The intervention started at week 3 and the kiwifruit crossover treatment was launched between weeks 6 and 12.Ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assay was utilized to measure the changes in plasma antioxidant activity(AOA) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay to measure the changes in plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), as a marker of lipid peroxidation (LP) at each measurement point. Since almost all participants had a normal range of baseline measurements of plasma AOA and LP (plasma MDA), they were categorized as relatively low and high AOA (1200micromol/L cut off point) and LP groups (1.70mmol/L cut off point), as well as divided into male and female groups. The effect of changed diet and increased physical activity during the 12 week study period resulted in a significant increase (P&lt;0.05) in plasma AOA. The changes were much higher in low AOA group (P=0.005) and in male subjects (P&lt;0.005), while no changes were observed in subjects with already high AOA at baseline. The increased plasma AOA level was maintained and increased even more over the year. No changes were observed in LP (plasma MDA). The effect of kiwifruit on the markers of oxidative stress was modest, the 3-week daily kiwifruit consumption (2-3 kiwifruit per day) resulted in significant increase (P=0.01) in plasma AOA only in female subjects within the low AOA group. However, the precision and validity of the measurements were limited by a possible loss of vitamin C due to storage of the plasma samples rather than analysis when fresh. Given that kiwifruit is particularly high in vitamin C the effect of the addition of kiwifruit to the diet might not have been detected. In this study it was shown that a group diet and physical activity intervention within the workplace can increase the level of plasma antioxidant activity and thereby reduce the risk for oxidative stress and related lifestyle diseases.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lifestyles</field><field name="subject">Health aspects</field><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Physical fitness</field><field name="subject">Oxidative stress and disease</field><field name="subject">Oxidative Stress</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of sagittal plane postures on trunk rotation range of motion</field><field name="creator">Montgomery, Trevor</field><field name="description">Axial rotation is regarded as an essential movement of the trunk that allows many individuals to participate in vocations, sports and activities of daily living. Unfortunately when the destabilising nature of rotation is combined with that of spinal flexion, the risk of injuring the spine can increase significantly. Few studies have investigated the potential benefits that maximizing trunk rotation has in certain vocation and sport-related arenas and none have looked at whether adopting certain spinal postures in the sagittal plane can maximise trunk rotation more than others.  The aim of the study was to determine the effects of alterations of trunk inclination, spinal posture, pelvic fixation and turning direction on the active range of motion (ROM) of trunk rotation. Twenty healthy individuals participated in the main study. Retro-reflective markers were placed on key anatomical locations and used to track the movement of the thorax and pelvis during a series of repeated maximal trunk rotations in ten different spinal positions within the sagittal plane. Trunk kinematics and kinetics were recorded simultaneously using an optoelectronic motion analysis and force platform measuring system. A repeated-measures multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to test for the main effects of trunk inclination, spinal posture, fixation of pelvis and direction of turn on maximum active ROM of trunk rotation, maximum pelvic rotation and the anterior-posterior and lateral displacement of the centre of pressure (COP). To investigate test-retest reliability, ten participants were tested on two separate days. Repeatability for each outcome measure was investigated using interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland Altman graphs. The majority of subjects showed reasonable test-retest reliability for trunk rotation measures in each of the test positions, with ICC&#8217;s ranging between 0.562 &#8211; 0.731. Overall, trunk inclination (0&#176;, 22.5&#176;, 45&#176;) forward in the sagittal plane had a significant effect on trunk and pelvic rotation (p&lt;0.001) and lateral displacement of the COP (p&lt;0.005) during trunk rotation. As trunk inclination increased from 0&#176; to 45&#176; there was an average increase in trunk rotation ROM of approximately 10 % (approximately 3.4&#176;). Furthermore, increasing trunk inclination led to an increase in lateral displacement of the COP and a decrease in pelvic rotation. Spinal posture (neutral, flexed, extended) at a forward inclination of 45&#176; had a significant effect on trunk rotation (p&lt;0.01) and pelvic rotation (p&lt;0.05), with a neutral spine averaging approximately 3 % (approximately 1.1&#176;) more trunk rotation than a flexed or extended posture.  The position and posture of the spine in the sagittal plane appears to have a significant influence on ranges of trunk rotation. The study suggests that rotating the trunk when adopting a neutral spine inclined to 45&#176; will maximise range of trunk rotation and encourage a natural stabilisation of the lower body. This posture meets the unique set of biomechanical requirements for the sport of golf and may help to reduce the risk of injury in manual material handling tasks. Conversely, rotating the trunk whilst the thoracolumbar spine is flexed leads to a reduction in trunk rotation ROM, encourages greater pelvic and lower body rotation, reduces torque production of the trunk and may increase the risk of lower back injury. These findings have important implications in relation to the teaching of spinal position during vocations, sports and activities of daily living that seek to maximise trunk rotation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trunk rotation</field><field name="subject">Trunk inclination</field><field name="subject">Spine posture</field><field name="subject">Randomised repeated measures</field><field name="subject">Pelvic fixation</field><field name="subject">Range of motion ROM</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of different intermittent priming strategies on 3km cycling performance</field><field name="creator">McIntyre, Jordan Patrick Ross</field><field name="description">Priming exercise, or the &#8216;warm-up&#8217;, is an accepted practice prior to exercise participation, physical training or sporting competition.  Traditionally, low intensity exercise has been used prior to both short- and long-duration events in an effort to prepare the athlete, but not fatigue them.  Recently, however, a more scientific approach to priming exercise has been considered important, with some research suggesting that a high intensity intermittent priming strategy may be optimal.  However, given the paucity of performance focussed &#8216;warm-up&#8217; studies, and that existing data regarding high-intensity priming strategies is inconclusive, the aim of this thesis was to determine the effects of three high-intensity intermittent priming strategies on physiological responses and subsequent 3km laboratory time-trial (TT) performance. Ten well-conditioned endurance-trained male cyclists (mean &#177; SD: age, 28.3 &#177; 8.4 yr, body mass, 81.8 &#177; 11.6 kg, stature, 1.8 &#177; 0.1 m,  O2peak, 4.6 &#177; 0.5 L&#8226;min&#8722;1) were recruited for this study.  After an initial incremental exercise test to exhaustion, participants completed four 3km time trials (TT) on four separate occasions, each preceded by a different priming strategy.  These included a &#8216;self-selected&#8217; (control) condition, and three high-intensity intermittent priming strategies of varying intensity (100% and 150% of the power at O2peak, and all-out) and fixed duration (15 minutes), each in predetermined random order.  Five minutes passive rest separated each priming exercise condition from the experimental 3km-TT.  Oxygen uptake ( O2) and heart rate (HR) were measured continuously, while blood lactate concentration ([BLa]) and core temperature (TC) were recorded at rest, post-priming exercise, and immediately prior to and following the 3km-TT.  In an attempt to provide a mechanistic explanation for changes in performance, O2 kinetic variables were determined from the O2 data.  Performance was quantified as a mean power (Wmean) and total time taken to complete the 3km-TT.  Mean power output and time taken for each 500m segment of the 3km-TT were also calculated. Results demonstrated that the athletes self-chosen priming condition (378.6 &#177; 44.0 W) resulted in Wmean that was slightly greater than both the lowest (376.3 &#177; 44.9 W; 0.7%; p = 0.57) and moderate (373.9 &#177; 47.8 W; 1.5%, p = 0.30) intensity intermittent priming condition, but significantly greater than the &#8216;all-out&#8217; intermittent sprint priming condition (357.4 &#177; 44.5 W; 5.8%, p = 0.0033).  Similar differences were observed for time.  While differences existed in the O2 deficit (however, mainly non-significant), these differences did not provide clear explanations for the differences in performance, with the moderate priming condition displaying a significantly reduced O2 deficit (59.4 &#177; 15.6 L, p &lt; 0.05), despite the non-significant change in Wmean, compared to the self-chosen priming condition (73.3 &#177; 18.6 L).  Additionally no significant differences were observed in either the time constant or the mean response time of O2.  Significant findings with regard to HR, [BLa] and TC were observed, but consistent with O2 kinetic variables, they were not related to, nor explain performance changes. In conclusion, regardless of intensity, different high-intensity intermittent priming exercise did not improve 3km-TT performance more than the control condition (self-chosen).  A priming strategy that is overly intense was detrimental to subsequent cycling performance.  The observed finding that a self-chosen priming strategy resulted in a comparable performance suggests that athletes are able to self-select (consciously or sub-consciously) a &#8216;warm-up&#8217; that is of appropriate intensity/duration.  Further work utilising the priming strategies from the current study with events of shorter duration is required to further clarify how priming strategies of this nature may affect track cycling performance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Priming</field><field name="subject">Cycling</field><field name="subject">Oxygen uptake kinetics</field><field name="subject">Supramaximal</field><field name="subject">Core temperature</field><field name="subject">Subsequent performance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of CPAP tube reverse flow</field><field name="creator">Li, Chutu</field><field name="description">CPAP is the most common treatment for moderate to severe sleep apnea in adults. Despite its efficacy, patients&#8217; safety, comfort and compliance are issues to be considered and improved in CPAP design. The issues include condensation, carbon dioxide in inhaled air, humidity and temperature of inhaled air. When a CPAP user breaths deeply, there will be some air not fully expelled and may be driven back into the heated air delivery tube (HADT). An interest has existed in what impacts this so called reverse flow may bring about to the CPAP use. The main objectives of this research are to quantify the reverse flow and its influence on carbon dioxide re-breathing, delivered humidity to the patient and condensation in the HADT. Within this thesis, two computer models of the CPAP system have been constructed on Simulink&#8482; in the Matlab&#8482; environment. One is about the CPAP fluid dynamic performance and carbon dioxide re-breathing and the other is on thermodynamic performance. The models can predict the dynamic behaviour of the CPAP machine. They are able to mimic the breath induced airflow fluctuation, and flow direction changes over wide real working ranges of ambient conditions, settings and coefficients. These models can be used for future analysis, development, improvement and design of the machine. The fluid dynamic and thermodynamic models were experimentally validated and they have proved to be valuable tool in the work. The main conclusions drawn from this study are: &#8226;	Reverse flow increases when breaths load increases and pressure setting decreases. &#8226;	Reverse flow does not definitely add exhaled air to the next inhalation unless the reverse flow is relatively too much. &#8226;	Mask capacity does not influence the reverse flow. &#8226;	The exhaled air re-breathed is mainly due to that stays in the mask, therefore larger mask capacity increases the exhaled air re-breath and the percentage of exhaled air in next inhalation drops when the breath load increases. &#8226;	Deep breathing does not significantly change the total evaporation in chamber. &#8226;	When deep breathing induced reverse flow occurs, condensation occurs or worsens in the HADT near the mask. This happens only when the humidity of the airflow from the CPAP is much lower than that of the exhaled air and the tube wall temperature is low enough for condensation to occur. &#8226;	The deep breathing and reverse flow do not significantly influence the average inhaled air temperature. &#8226;	The overall specific humidity in inhaled air is lower under deep breathing. &#8226;	Mask capacity does not influence the thermal conditions in the HADT and the inhaled air specific humidity. Also the mask capacity does not significantly influences the inhaled air temperature.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sleep disorder</field><field name="subject">CPAP design</field><field name="subject">Breathing research</field><field name="subject">Lab experiments</field><field name="subject">Simulink modeling</field><field name="subject">Thermal dynamics</field><field name="subject">Fluid dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of green shelled mussel mariculture on benthic communities in Hauraki Gulf</field><field name="creator">Wong, Clara</field><field name="description">Sea-bed benthic-invertebrate assemblages of species within and proximal to an existing mussel farm off Taniwhanui Point, eastern Waiheke Island, are reported. Substratum type, whether predominantly mud, gravels or an admixture of the two, mud/gravels, is shown to influence infaunal species assemblage composition; the bivalve Theora lubrica, ostracods, amphipods and polychaetes characterise muddy substrata; polychaetes, particularly spionids and syllids, ostracods, amphipods, bivalves and ophiuroids characterise mud/gravel substrata; and diverse assemblages of polychaetes, bivalves, pagurid crabs, gastropods, ostracods, ophiuroids and nemertean worms characterise gravel substrata. Significant differences in sea-bed assemblages are reported along one transect inside and outside the farm over the three seasons during which surveys were conducted, summer, autumn, winter of 2008. Along the northern side of the mussel farm those sediments beneath the farm are characterised by greater abundances of polychaetes and crustaceans (Malacostraca), whereas sediments outside the farm are characterised by greater abundances of bivalves and ostracods. Sediments both inside and outside the north-eastern border of the farm during summer are characterised by similar abundances of polychaetes, bivalves and ostracods. Similarly, those sediments within and outside the farm along its southern border during summer are characterised by abundances of polychaetes, bivalves, crustaceans (Malacostraca) and gastropods. Measures of relative abundance, rarity and species richness are applied to sea-bed assemblages off eastern Waiheke Island to enable an appraisal of the spatial distribution of each within and outside the farm, and throughout the eastern Waiheke Island region. One of these measures, relative abundance, is then compared with other, albeit limited abundance data from previous soft-sediment surveys conducted throughout Hauraki Gulf. The most species rich and abundant sites off eastern Waiheke Island occur in gravelly substrata between Waiheke Island and Pakatoa Island, and between Rotoroa and Ponui Islands, in addition to beneath the southern portion of the existing mussel farm. Gravel-based substrata are recognised to be the most species rich and densely populated with invertebrates for this sediment type in Hauraki Gulf. Similarly, the muddy substrata off eastern Waiheke Island region appear to host more individuals and species than any other reported muddy substratum in Hauraki Gulf. The existing mussel farm is shown to significantly affect sea-bed communities, but in a manner that has not been previously reported in New Zealand. Species richness and abundance are greater beneath the farm, as are the proportions of very rare and uncommon taxa to more common and ubiquitous taxa. Sediments beneath the farm are not characterised by elevated abundances and richness of opportunistic species; and no obvious difference in sediment grain size is apparent along a transect extending from 20 m inside the farm to at least 110 m outside it. The biological footprint of the farm is limited, appearing to extend no further than 20 metres from the northern physical boundary of the farm; the gross sedimentary characteristics (grain size) do not differ significantly within and outside the farm. Within and immediately outside the farm species richness and abundance tend to increase during colder seasons; beneath the farm, species richness (d), abundance (N), Shannon index (H&#8217;) and Simpson index (1-&#955;&#8217;) were higher during May (autumn) and August (winter) than during February (summer); diversity values outside the farm were similar during summer and autumn, but species richness (d), evenness (J&#8217;), Shannon index (H&#8217;) and Simpson index (1-&#955;&#8217;) were all greater during winter. No opportunistic taxa are considered to be appropriate indicators of organically enriched environments, at least enrichment that can be intuitively linked to any direct effect of the existing mussel farm. One species, the heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum, only rarely occurs inside the physical farm boundary, so its relative abundance renders it an appropriate indicator species of mussel-farm impacts.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine aquaculture</field><field name="subject">Mussel farming</field><field name="subject">Seabed communities</field><field name="subject">Mariculture impact</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/663</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into potential mismatches between teacher intention and learner interpretation of task</field><field name="creator">Ashcroft, Mark Frank</field><field name="description">Recently, task-based research motivated by a Vygotskian theoretical perspective has led to studies that demonstrate how the task-as-workplan is interpreted and reshaped by learners in actual performance (Coughlan and Duff, 1994). The ability of learners to set their own &#8216;tasks&#8217; suggests that researchers need to investigate how individual students react to the tasks they have been asked to perform (Ellis, 2003).  To date, there have been very few systematic studies on learner and teacher perceptions in this particular field. Four studies conducted by Kumaravadivelu (1989, 1991), Slimani (1989, 1992), Block (1994, 1996), and Barkhuizhen (1998) have shed light on the learner and teacher perception of classroom events. This study has continued the investigation into how individual students react to the tasks they have been asked to perform. In particular, it has focussed on four potential mismatches between teacher intention and learners&#8217; interpretation of task, previously identified in a study by Kumaravadivelu (2003): instructional, pedagogic, procedural and strategic.  The study aimed to look at teacher and learners&#8217; perceptions and therefore a qualitative approach was used to gather information. The study was triangulated on two levels, using a variety of data (data triangulation) and different methods (questionnaires and interviews) to collect the data (methodological triangulation). Sixteen students studying for a Certificate in English at the School of Languages and Social Sciences at Auckland University of Technology were asked to perform a task and then complete a questionnaire which was designed to elicit information regarding the four potential mismatches, between teacher intention and learner interpretation, referred to above. Four pairs of students participated in each of the two tasks. Four students, one from each pair was then interviewed in order to elicit more in-depth information regarding the four mismatches referred to above. The teacher was also interviewed after the task had been completed. The student answers from the questionnaires were compared with the data gathered from the student and teacher interviews. The findings seem to show that two mismatches between teacher intention and learners&#8217; interpretation were evident, namely instructional and pedagogic. There was no clear evidence of a strategic or procedural mismatch. Despite the small sample size, the study seems to show that mismatches are identifiable. Given the importance of perceptual mismatches and the fact that they are part of the practice of everyday teaching, it is important that we try to identify as many mismatches as possible in future research. It is reasonable to assume that the narrower the gap between teacher intention and learner interpretation, the greater the chances of achieving learning and teaching objectives (Kumaravadivelu, 2003).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Potential mismatches</field><field name="subject">Learner interpretation</field><field name="subject">Teacher intention</field><field name="subject">Task</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between M&#257;ori cultural identity and health</field><field name="creator">Stevenson, Brendan</field><field name="description">While the differences in health between cultures co-existing in the same country have been well researched, there has been insufficient attention paid to the definition of culture used in these studies.  Typically the ethnicity of an individual has been determined along biological lines or by the country of origin.  However, the culture with which an individual identifies may not be so clear: an individual may identify with a number of cultures, from the social group with whom they socialise, to the religion they follow.  Measuring the degree to which an individual identifies with a particular culture (their cultural identity), would allow an assessment of how membership in that culture influences health outcomes.  The present study investigated the relationship between the cultural identity (CI) of M&#257;ori and their health.  The main hypothesis was that a higher CI would be positively correlated with better health.  The relationships between demographic factors (e.g. age, gender, &amp; socio-economic status (SES)), CI, and a number of health indicators (self rated health, smoking behaviour, alcohol consumption, &amp; exercise/sporting behaviours) were also examined.  The sample used in the present study (767 adult M&#257;ori) was a subset of the data collected the Te Hoe Nuku Roa M&#257;ori profiles project.  The development of a CI measure incorporated seven cultural indicators: Whakapapa (ancestry), Marae Participation, Whana&#363; associations (extended family), Whenua Tipu (ancestral land), contact with M&#257;ori people, Use of te Reo (M&#257;ori language), and kai (food preferences). A series of hierarchical linear regressions found that CI was not directly related to health indicators in the present study. There were weak interactions between CI, age, and smoking behaviour; CI, home ownership, and involvement in sport; and age, Crowding and involvement in sport.  Additional findings were that more Sporting Involvement/exercise was moderately correlated with improved health, and there was a weak relationship between CI and SES.  It was speculated that the lack of significant findings may be due to a difference in the quality of participants&#8217; CI: The CI measure did not distinguish between those who learn their culture and those who live their culture (each group tending to be in differing social and economic positions).  Recommendations from the study were: Further validation of the CI measure, and assessment of the distribution of CI over urban/rural areas, SES and age; additional research into the relationship between young M&#257;ori smokers and their CI; assessing how the level of Sporting Involvement varies across the social and economic realities of M&#257;ori; and the development of appropriate measures utilising the whana&#363;/household as the unit of analysis.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cultural identity</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Te Hoe Nuku Roa</field><field name="subject">Health</field><field name="subject">Regression</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380105 Social and community psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the interfaces of online discussion forums to enhance learning support : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Information Science in Information Systems at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jonnavithula, Lalitha</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a research work aimed at improving the interfaces of online discussion forums (ODFs) in relation to their functional support to enhance learning. These ODFs form part of almost all Learning Management Systems (LMSs) such as WebCT, Moodle and Blackboard, which are widely used in education nowadays. Although ODFs are identified as valuable sources to learning, their interfaces are limited in terms of providing support to students, such as in the areas of managing their postings as well as in facilitating them to quickly locate and obtain specified information. In addition, these systems lack features to support inter-institutional cooperation that could potentially increase knowledge sharing between students and educators of different institutions. The interface design objective of this study therefore was to explore and overcome the limitations identified as above, and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of ODFs&#8217; support to learning. Using a task centered design approach; the required features were developed, and implemented in a working prototype called eQuake (electronic Question answer knowledge environment). eQuake is a shared online discussion forum system developed as an add-on to a well-known open source e-learning platform (Moodle). This system was intended for use among interinstitutional students in New Zealand tertiary institutions that teach similar courses. The improved interface functionalities of eQuake are expected to enhance learning support in terms of widening communication among users, increasing knowledge base, providing existing matching answer(s) quickly to students, and exposing students to multiple perspectives. This study considers such improvements to ODF interfaces as vital to enable users to enjoy the benefits of technology-mediated environment. The perceived usefulness and ease-of-use of improved features in eQuake were evaluated using a quantitative experimental research method. The evaluation was conducted at three tertiary institutions in New Zealand, and the overall results indicated positive response, although some suggestions for improvement have been made in the evaluation. This thesis presents a review of the related literature, describes the design and development of a user interface, followed by its implementation in eQuake, and a description of the evaluation. The thesis concludes with recommendations for better interface design of ODFs and provides suggestions for future research in this area.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">discussion forums</field><field name="subject">online learning</field><field name="subject">e-learning</field><field name="subject">user interface</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280104 Computer-human interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/968</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflective Qualities of the Artistic Creative Process and Chaos Theory: A Study of the Relationship and the Implications for Art Education and Teaching</field><field name="creator">Regent, Barbara</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT What is visual art making, the artistic creative process, and how does it work?  These questions fuelled an investigation at first theoretical, then incorporating an empirical study centered on attaining understanding relating to the elements and dynamics involved in making visual art.  The resultant study aims to offer an approach to gaining comprehensive understanding of the artistic creative process, an understanding that may inform art teaching practice, so that art teachers may better understand the related dynamics of their pedagogical processes. Historically the artistic creative process has been accepted as one consisting of different sequential stages of development. This view however, is evolving due to the growing understanding of interrelated dynamics of life processes offered by, for example, neurological studies of the brain. New thinking links earlier philosophical and psychological ideas presented by such thinkers as James (1894) and Dewey (1934), to the work of Baars (1999), Brown (2000), Ellis (1999), Zeki (2000), in offering a deeper understanding of the natural human creative process.  The reflective aspect of the artistic creative process is thus related to the way that we process information every minute of our lives; essentially it is the way we progress through life, minute by minute, learning and evolving, affirming self through finding meaning.  Study of current theory relating to the processes of the brain inevitably incorporates modern thinking that revolves around dynamic processes. Originating in thermodynamics, Chaos Theory has travelled far from physics to become incorporated into a broad spectrum of disciplines. It offers a common language that relates to the dynamics of human nature, and as such is totally applicable to areas of learning and human interaction. Here used metaphorically, Chaos Theory serves to elucidate interactive aspects of the discipline of art making, with much to offer an understanding of the artistic creative process as it describes exactly the same process of change and growth through experience. A metaphorical use of the language of Chaos Theory provides visual art making with a means of sharing ideas with other academic disciplines that also constantly deal with the dynamics of the human condition, found for example in the close connections between the methods of exploration of both artists and scientists. In studying the phenomenon of &#8216;scale&#8217; the physicist Feigenbaum commented on the connections between perceptions of artists and those of scientists, pointing to the way in which their perceptions and analysis of things coincide (Gleick, 1987). The visual analysis evident in the work of Turner or Ruskin reflects the same process of detailed conceptual exploration of material collected by the senses as that of a student of any field of scientific exploration. Chaos Theory is important also in that it provides a language accessible by varying levels of expertise, whether at a simple metaphorical or a more sophisticated level. This work charts these dimensions because &#8220;The challenge is to reverse the disconnectedness of the present world and to develop a curriculum that is not based on separateness of knowledge from life and being, but upon their inherent unity and integration&#8221; (Lovat and Smith, 1995, p.248).</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reflective Qualities</field><field name="subject">Artistic Creative Process</field><field name="subject">Creative Process</field><field name="subject">Chaos Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24848</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Footprints in the forest : a visual exploration of the tall timber forests of northern New South Wales.</field><field name="creator">Coumbe, Susan</field><field name="description">Masters Research - Master of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">forest environment</field><field name="subject">tall timber forests</field><field name="subject">sculptural installation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/37566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritional influences in pregnancy and postpartum for women and their children</field><field name="creator">Hure, Alexis</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pregnancy</field><field name="subject">postpartum</field><field name="subject">dietary intake</field><field name="subject">weight</field><field name="subject">vitamin B12</field><field name="subject">folate</field><field name="subject">homocysteine</field><field name="subject">infant</field><field name="subject">adiposity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/37573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Validation of the no slip boundary condition at solid-liquid interfaces</field><field name="creator">Honig, Christopher David Frederick</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the study of the hydrodynamic boundary condition at the solid-liquid interface using the colloidal probe Atomic Force Microscope.

This thesis investigated memory retrieval processes in trauma survivors with and without symptoms of posttraumatic stress, and in non-traumatised individuals exposed to a highly arousing event. Study 1 examined deliberate avoidance of unwanted memories in recent trauma survivors. The results indicated that attempts to forget were associated with poorer recall of forgotten information, but the size of this effect did not depend on the presence or absence of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD). Study 2 investigated automatic retrieval inhibition in trauma survivors with or without Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The results suggested that repeated retrieval of trauma-related information by individuals with PTSD can cause inhibition of related, but unpractised information. Studies 3 and 4 examined the relationship between the vantage point of trauma memories, avoidance and posttraumatic stress symptomatology. The findings indicated that recalling a traumatic event from an observer perspective is associated with post trauma avoidance. They also showed that an observer vantage point in the initial few weeks after trauma is associated with poorer long-term post trauma adjustment. Studies 5, 6 and 7 were analogue studies which analysed the impact of heightened arousal on memory retrieval in novice skydivers. The results suggested that elevated arousal can interfere with retrieval of information related to the arousal-inducing event. Study 7 also indicated that autobiographical memory for the event may be impaired. Finally, Study 8 examined the qualities of trauma memories that were accessed via different modes of retrieval. The results provided evidence that intrusive memories were experienced as more realistic and with more intense affect than memories for the same event that were deliberately retrieved. Together, the findings of this program of research extend current  theories of PTSD by highlighting the mechanisms through which retrieval of trauma memories may be impaired. The results suggest that the quality of trauma memories is affected by avoidance processes, elevated arousal and level of conscious control the individual exerts over retrieval.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Post-traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">Psychic trauma</field><field name="subject">Memory</field><field name="subject">Stress (Psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimisation and improvement of the design of scarf repairs to aircraft</field><field name="creator">Harman, Alex Bruce, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Flush repairs to military aircraft are expected to become more prevalent as more thick skin composites are used, particularly on the surface of the fuselage, wings and other external surfaces. The use of these repairs, whilst difficult to manufacture provide an aerodynamic, ???stealthy??? finish that is also more structurally efficient than overlap repairs. This research was undertaken to improve the design methodology of scarf repairs with reduced material removal and to investigate the damage tolerance of scarf repair to low velocity impact damage. Scarf repairs involve shallow bevel angles to ensure the shear stress in the adhesive does not exceed allowable strength. This is important when repairing structures that need to withstand hot and humid conditions, when the adhesive properties degrade. Therefore, considerable amounts of parent material must be machined away prior to repair. The tips of the repair patch and the parent laminate are very sharp, thus a scarf repair is susceptible to accidental damage. The original contributions include: ???	Developed analytic means of predicting the stresses within optimised scarf joints with dissimilar materials. New equations were developed and solved using numerical algorithms. ???	Verified using finite element modelling that a scarfed insert with dissimilar modulus subjected to uniaxial loading attracted the same amount of load as an insert without a scarf. As such, the simple analytic formula used to predict load attraction/diversion through a plate with an insert may be used to predict the load attraction/diversion into a scarf repair that contains a dissimilar adherend patch. ???	Developed a more efficient flush joint with a doubler insert placed near the mid line of the parent structure material. This joint configuration has a lower load eccentricity than external doubler joint. ???	Investigated the damage tolerance of scarf joints, with and without the external doubler. The results showed that scarf joints without external doublers exhibited a considerable strength reduction following low velocity impact. Based on the observations, the major damage mechanics in the scarf joint region following impact have been identified. These results demonstrated that it is important to incorporate damage tolerance in the design of scarf repairs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Airplanes -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Composite materials -- Testing.</field><field name="subject">Airplanes -- Fuselage -- Maintenance and repair.</field><field name="subject">Joints (Engineering).</field><field name="subject">Finite element method.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26788</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling and characterization of multipath fading channels in cellular mobile communication systems</field><field name="creator">Khan, Noor Muhammad, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Due to the enormous capacity and performance gains associated with the use of antenna arrays in wireless multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication links, it is inevitable that these technologies will become an integral part of future systems. In order to assess the potential of such beam-oriented technologies, direct representation of the dispersion of multipath fading channel in angular and temporal domains is required. This representation can only be achieved with the use of spatial channel models. This thesis thus focuses on the issue of spatial channel modeling for cellular systems and on its use in the characteri- zation of multipath fading channels. The results of this thesis are presented mainly in five parts: a) modeling of scattering mechanisms, b) derivation of the closed-form expressions for the spatio-temporal characteristics, c) generalization of the quantitative measure of angular spread, d) investigation of the effect of mobile motion on the spatio-temporal characteris- tics, and e) characterization of fast fading channel and its use in the signature sequence adaptation for direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system. The thesis begins with an overview of the fundamentals of spatial channel modeling with regards to the specifics of cellular environments. Previous modeling approaches are dis- cussed intensively and a generalized spatial channel model, the 'Eccentro-Scattering Model' is proposed. Using this model, closed-form mathematical expressions for the distributions of angle and time of multipath arrival are derived. These theoretical results for the picocell, microcell and macrocell environments, when compared with previous models and available measurements, are found to be realistic and generic. In macrocell environment, the model incorporates the effect of distant scattering structures in addition to the local ones. Since the angular spread is a key factor of the second order statistics of fading processes in wireless communications, the thesis proposes a novel generalized method of quantifying the angular spread of the multipath power distribution. The proposed method provides almost all parameters about the angular spread, which can be further used for calculating more accurate spatial correlations and other statistics of multipath fading channels. The degree of accuracy in such correlation calculations can lead to the computation of exact separation distances among array elements required for maximizing capacity in MIMO systems or diversity antennas. The proposed method is also helpful in finding the exact standard deviation of the truncated angular distributions and angular data acquired in measurement campaigns. This thesis also indicates the significance of the effects of angular distribution truncation on the angular spread. Due to the importance of angular spread in the fading statistics, it is proposed as the goodness-of-fit measure in measurement campaigns. In this regard, comparisons of some notable azimuthal models with the measurement results are shown. The effect of mobile motion on the spatial and temporal characteristics of the channel is also discussed. Three mobile motion scenarios are presented, which can be considered to be responsible for the variations of the spatio-temporal statistical parameters of the multipath signals. Two different cases are also identified, when the terrain and clutter of the mobile surroundings have an additional effect on the temporal spread of the channel during mobile motion. The effect of increasing mobile-base separation on the angular and temporal spreads is elaborated in detail. The proposed theoretical results in spatial characteristics can be extended to characterizing and tracking transient behavior of Doppler spread in time-varying fast fading channels; likewise the proposed theoretical results in temporal characteristics can be utilized in designing efficient equalizers for combating inter-symbol interference (ISI) in time-varying frequency-selective fading channels. In the last part of the thesis, a linear state-space model is developed for signature sequence adaptation over time-varying fast fading channels in DS-CDMA systems. A decision directed adaptive algorithm, based on the proposed state-space model and Kalman filter, is presented. The algorithm outperforms the gradient-based algorithms in tracking the received distorted signature sequence over time-varying fast fading channels. Simulation results are presented which show that the performance of a linear adaptive receiver can be improved significantly with signature tracking on high Doppler spreads in DS-CDMA systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26999</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of some statistical and economic models involving exchange rates.</field><field name="creator">Buncic, Daniel, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation is concerned with the examination of some widely employed nonlinear exchange rate models. In particular, its aim is to assess how well non-linear statistical models accommodate the theoretical implications contained in economic models and how well they are able to capture the empirical properties of the data.  Chapter 2 gives a brief background to the concept of PPP and discusses the role of transaction costs in economic models, making it necessary to model exchange rates within a non-linear framework. Parametric as well as non-parametric statistical techniques are applied to a long time-series data set to give an indication of the empirical validity of non-linearity in real exchange rates. Wide threshold bands are found to be a common characteristic of real exchange rate data.  Chapter 3 studies the fitness of the ESTAR model for real exchange rate modelling. It is shown that wide threshold bands in the empirical data necessitate a small transition function parameter in the exponential regime weighting function, leading to difficulties in the meaningful interpretation of regimes. When this occurs, it is also shown that the ESTAR model is weakly identified over the range of the sample data that one generally works with. These results are illustrated on an empirical data set by replicating the often cited study of Taylor et al. (2001).  In Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 a number of non-linear models are evaluated. Simulation experiments indicate that LM style tests that are commonly employed in the literature to test for ESTAR non-linearity have a very low probability of rejecting the false null hypothesis of linearity when the true data generating process is in fact the ESTAR model of Taylor et al. (2001). It is further shown that, contrary to the claims of the recent study by Rapach and Wohar (2006), long-horizon forecasts from the ESTAR model converge to the unconditional mean of the series, so that there is no gain in utilising the ESTAR model for long-horizon forecasts. Studying the Markov switching model of Bergman and Hansson (2005) reveals that the model does not generate any non-linearity as predicted from economic models.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foreign exchange rates -- Econometric models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40577</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Arab as spectacle: race, gender and representation in Australian popular culture</field><field name="creator">Abood, Paula, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis, The Arab as Spectacle, is about representation. It is about the limits and the contradictions of representation. It is about the burden and the violence of representation. It is about the persistence of Orientalism and how the hierarchies of race and gender intersect with discourses on sexuality to inform and inflect the representation of Arabs in contemporary literary and media spheres of Australian popular culture. This thesis comprises two sections. Part One is a research dissertation that explores the strategies, devices and parameters of the representation of Arabic culture and identities through close readings of specific texts. This theoretical project inaugurates the second part of my study which takes up the question of the contradictions of representation through a collection of ficto-critical writings. Through these satirical narratives, I seek to expose and disrupt the hegemony of Orientalist representations that proliferate in English language literature and news media by bringing into focus the inherent paradox of representation, working within and against Orientalist representational traditions. In so doing, it is not my aim to 'correct' the Orientalist logic and imagery that I theorise in the first part of this thesis, but rather to undermine the spurious truth-value of Orientalist representations by deploying the literary weapons of satire, parody and irony. In this way, my fiction works to engage creatively and critically with the very tropes that I theorise in my research dissertation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Orientalism.</field><field name="subject">Representation (Philosophy)</field><field name="subject">Arabs in popular culture -- Western countries.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of Activin A in the regulation of adult neurogenesis.</field><field name="creator">Abdipranoto, Andrea, St. Vincent Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Adult neurogenesis is defined as the generation of new nerve cells in the adult central nervous system (CNS). Stimulating neurogenesis may potentially offer a therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson???s disease. However, it is not clear why neurogenesis does not normally replace neurons lost in these diseases. As a first step to address this problem it is necessary to identify mechanisms that regulate adult neurogenesis in the normal and diseased brain and further, determine if manipulating these mechanisms may offer therapeutic potential. In this thesis, we identify activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor ?? (TGF??) superfamily, as a significant regulator of neurogenesis. We demonstrate that mRNA encoding activin A is expressed after a KA injury, and that inhibition of this activin A profoundly impairs neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Further we demonstrate that activin A impairs gliosis and also has potent anti-inflammatory effects in the injured hippocampus. Finally, we provide evidence that the majority of activin A???s neurogenic effect results from its potent anti-inflammatory actions. Our study draws a clear link between neurogenesis and inflammation in the CNS and is the first to provide evidence that this process is regulated through activin signalling. Since inflammation is now believed to be an important component of many neurological diseases we suggest that therapeutic compounds that enhance activin A signalling may offer a therapeutic approach for treating these diseases by suppressing inflammation and stimulating neurogenesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Activin.</field><field name="subject">Developmental neurobiology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and control of nonlinear processes with static nonlinearities.</field><field name="creator">Chan, Kwong Ho, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Process control has been playing an increasingly important role in many industrial applications as an effective way to improve product quality, process costeffectiveness and safety. Simple linear dynamic models are used extensively in process control practice, but they are limited to the type of process behavior they can approximate. It is well-documented that simple nonlinear models can often provide much better approximations to process dynamics than linear models. It is evident that there is a potential of significant improvement of control quality through the implementation of the model-based control procedures. However, such control applications are still not widely implemented because mathematical process models in model-based control could be very difficult and expensive to obtain due to the complexity of those systems and poor understanding of the underlying physics. The main objective of this thesis is to develop new approaches to modeling and control of nonlinear processes.  In this thesis, the multivariable nonlinear processes are approximated using a model with a static nonlinearity and a linear dynamics. In particular, the Hammerstein model structure, where the nonlinearity is on the input, is used. Cardinal spline functions are used to identify the multivariable input nonlinearity. Highlycoupled nonlinearity can also be identified due to flexibility and versatility of cardinal spline functions. An approach that can be used to identify both the nonlinearity and linear dynamics in a single step has been developed. The condition of persistent excitation has also been derived.  Nonlinear control design approaches for the above models are then developed in this thesis based on: (1) a nonlinear compensator; (2) the extended internal model control (IMC); and (3) the model predictive control (MPC) framework. The concept of passivity is used to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system of each of the approaches. In the nonlinear compensator approach, the passivity of the process is recovered using an appropriate static nonlinearity. The non-passive linear system is passified using a feedforward system, so that the passified overall system can be stabilized by a passive linear controller with the nonlinear compensator. In the extended IMC approach, dynamic inverses are used for both the input nonlinearity and linear dynamics. The concept of passive systems and the passivity-based stability conditions are used to obtain the invertible approximations of the subsystems and guarantee the stability of the nonlinear closed-loop system. In the MPC approach, a numerical inverse is implemented. The condition for which the numerical inversion is guaranteed to converge is derived. Based on these conditions, the input space in which the numerical inverse can be obtained is identified. This constitutes new constraints on the input space, in addition to the physical input constraints. The total input constraints are transformed into linear input constraints using polytopic descriptions and incorporated in the MPC design.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical process control.</field><field name="subject">Chemical processes.</field><field name="subject">Predictive control.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40620</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The weakly nonlinear stability of an oscillatory fluid flow</field><field name="creator">Reid, Francis John Edward, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">A weakly nonlinear stability analysis was conducted for the flow induced in an incompressible, Newtonian, viscous fluid lying between two infinite parallel plates which form a channel. The plates are oscillating synchronously in simple harmonic motion. The disturbed velocity of the flow was written in the form of a series in powers of a parameter  which is a measure of the distance away from the linear theory neutral conditions. The individual terms of this series were decomposed using Floquet theory and Fourier series in time. The equations at second order and third order in  were derived, and solutions for the Fourier coefficients were found using pseudospectral methods for the spatial variables. Various alternative methods of computation were applied to check the validity of the results obtained. The Landau equation for the amplitude of the disturbance was obtained, and the existence of equilibrium amplitude solutions inferred. The values of the coefficients in the Landau equation were calculated for the nondimensional channel half-widths h for the cases h = 5, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16. It was found that equilibrium amplitude solutions exist for points in wavenumber Reynolds number space above the smooth portion of the previously determined linear stability neutral curve in all the cases examined. Similarly, Landau coefficients were calculated on a special feature of the neutral curve (called a ???finger???) for the case h = 12. Equilibrium amplitude solutions were found to exist at points inside the finger, and in a particular region outside near the top of the finger. Traces of the x-components of the disturbance velocities have been presented for a range of positions across the channel, together with the size of the equilibrium amplitude at these positions. As well, traces of the x-component of the velocity of the disturbed flow and traces of the velocity of the basic flow have been given for comparison at a particular position in the channel.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Navier-Stokes equations -- Numerical solutions.</field><field name="subject">Hydrodynamics.</field><field name="subject">Fluid mechanics -- Mathematics.</field><field name="subject">Stability.</field><field name="subject">Boundary layer.</field><field name="subject">Reynolds number.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of systematic increase in pozzolanic materials on the mechanical, durability, and microstructural characteristics of concrete</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Mohammad Sharfuddin, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of high performance concrete in construction has been enhanced by the use of pozzolanic materials. However, the use of these materials has not been optimized. Such optimization may be achieved by a systematic increase in the amount and combination of pozzolanic material additions, with accompanying studies of their effects on the mechanical, durability and microstructural characteristics of blended concrete. This work evaluated various concrete durability issues by studying systematic increases of pozzolanic materials such as fly ash and blast furnace slag (BFS) in the range of 25, 50 and 70%, and silica fume at 10% of total cementitious materials, forming various binary and ternary concrete blends. The concrete specimens were cured for a period of seven days after demoulding in line with widely practiced commercial curing procedures. The research explored the role and effectiveness of various binary and ternary blends of pozzolanic materials on the mechanical, durability and microstructural characteristics of concrete. Durability was evaluated by two independent rapid chloride permeability tests measured as charge passed and chloride conductivity from the RCPT and UCT tests respectively. These two rapid tests were coupled with long-term ponding tests to evaluate chloride ingress and the extent of corrosion for a period of two years. Further durability tests such as carbonation, drying shrinkage and porosity of these blends were also undertaken. This study also utilized micro-analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy to follow the hydration mechanism in various binary and ternary blends. Statistical significance testing was used to analyse and confirm all experimental results and conclusions. It is well known that a level of caution is exercised in the construction industry in the use of ternary blends. This study aims to evaluate the durability aspects of ternary concrete blends, in addition to binary blends, for resistance to chloride, corrosion, carbonation attacks and provide recommendations relating to the limits of blending level, as well as exposure conditions for blended concretes, based on the results of this study. It is expected that this will fill a major knowledge gap observed in the concrete industry. A comparison of two rapid chloride permeability tests such as UCT and RCPT indicates that the UCT test is easy and practicable, and does not contradict results obtained in the standard RCPT. However, the statistical significance of results obtained for some blends was only able to be established by using the RCPT. This effect can be attributed to the larger size specimens compared to UCT. The recommended blend to acquire both early-age and long-term strength development in fly ash is the ternary blends comprising 10% silica fume and 25% fly ash cast using lower w/b ratio. In addition, the same blend exhibited lower carbonation depth, lower charge passed from RCPT, lower chloride ingress and higher corrosion resistance characteristics from long-term ponding test compared to other blends of fly ash. In BFS blends, an increase in compressive strength was observed only in the specimens of 25% BFS compared to other higher percentage blends, while the higher addition of 50 and 70% replacement showed no significant difference in compressive strength between them and their corresponding ternary blends with addition of silica fume. The results of this study indicate that control (OPC) specimens cast with increased w/b ratio of 0.48 showed higher chloride ingress compared to both binary blends of 70% fly ash and 70% BFS specimens. This indicates that (OPC) cast using higher w/b ratio is to be avoided in chloride environments. On the other hand, though, the ternary blends of 10% silica fume and up to 50% fly ash exhibited lower chloride ingress compared to their respective binary blends of fly ash. However, these ternary blends exhibited lower compressive strength, more negative corrosion potential and higher corrosion rate, compared to the respective binary blends of 25% fly ash and its ternary blends. Therefore, the recommended blend observed in the long-term ponding test is the ternary blend of 25% fly ash and 10% silica fume. The recommended level of corrosion resistance in slag specimens is achieved by the use of ternary blends comprising silica fume at 10% added to the blend that contains up to 70% slag. However, the recommended level of slag for a lower carbonation effect is the use of a ternary blend comprising 50% slag and 10% silica fume (3B5S1) which showed a carbonation depth of 10.8 mm and a compressive strength of 53.2 MPa after 365 days of exposure. The drying shrinkage of concrete increased with the increase in fly ash and the same trend was observed in BFS specimens. However, the results were not significantly different between their respective blends. The extent of carbonation in fly ash specimens was higher compared to BFS blends specimens. This can be attributed to the formation of dusty and weak surfaces on the outer surface in addition to the excessive leaching of sodium chloride solution from the long-term ponding test in the former specimens compared to later. The high volume pozzolanic materials, irrespective of fly ash or BFS and addition of silica fume (70% fly ash and 10% silica fume, and 70% BFS and 10% silica fume), showed higher cumulative pore volume indicating that these blends with seven days of curing were not beneficial. These high volume ternary blends required prolonged curing to release portlandite from the hydration of cement to continue the pozzolanic reaction. This study has shown that 7-days curing of the pozzolanic concrete is inadequate if pozzolanic activity is to be invoked. This is particularly the case when it is expected that the concrete is likely to be subjected to a harsher than usual environment characterised by a dry atmosphere.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">concert</field><field name="subject">durability</field><field name="subject">additives</field><field name="subject">pozzolanic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The improvement of cancer management by the application of the currently available knowledge</field><field name="creator">Barton, Michael, Clinical School - South Western Sydney, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">I have been intensively involved in the research on the application of currently available knowledge for the improvement of cancer care.

This research covers the modelling, design, fabrication and experiment of the polymer optical cross-fibre (4-period-SCF) whose cross-sectional view resembles a cross.  A new wedge waveguide model has been formulated and applied to demonstrate that for any given parameters, the cross fibre gives the same performance for single-mode operation as the N-period-SCFs (for N = 2, 6 and 8). These fibres behave identically if the high-index segment angle, &#952;1, is the same and the low-index segment angular width, &#952;2, is sufficiently large for negligible adjacent mode coupling effects. This remarkable finding has significant ramifications for SCF fabrication, design and performance. Theoretical predictions confirmed by experiments demonstrated that a cross-fibre is all that needed to fabricate a large-core single-mode-fibre with no geometry-induced birefringence.   The high-index outer ring effects on the cross fibre single-mode performance have been systematically investigated for the first time. The study reveals that the ring index value higher than its core index has very strong effects on single-mode performance.  Within a narrow range of &#952;1, the minimum fibre length required for single-mode operation is reduced but outside this angle range, longer single-mode length is required. Furthermore, the fibre can be anti-guiding if &#952;1 exceeds the cutoff angle. Incorporating the fabrication constraints, the optimal cross-fibre design with high-index ring is achieved by optimising the relative index difference, high-index segment angle and core-cladding diameter ratio.  Two preform-making techniques developed for the cross-fibres fabrication include the cladding-segment-in-tube method and the core-cladding-segment-in-tube method. The innovative approach in these methods overcomes the problems of bubble formation and fractures, which are related to the fibre structure complexity and the polymer intrinsic properties and their processing. It enables the successful drawing of single-mode fibres. This thesis reports the first experimental demonstration of single-mode operation of large-core cross-fibre. Three experimental studies with different cross-fibre designs have demonstrated (i) large-core single-mode operation, (ii) high-index ring effects on fibre performance and (iii) cross-fibre optimal design trial.

For many learners in Australia, especially beginners, it is difficult to find a variety of opportunities and maintain motivation to seek out and participate in such opportunities to use Japanese. In the present study, the researcher exploits sociocultural approaches (SCT) in a beginning-level Japanese language program in an institutional setting in order to enable language learners to become language users in Australia. Based on Lave and Wenger (1999), the study considers that learning a foreign/second language brings about not only the acquisition of linguistic structures but also leads to changes in participation in communities. Adopting SCT, the researcher created Japanese language revision courses at an Australian university and designed participant roles, rules, and artefacts in the revision courses as well as devising activities that aimed to develop the classroom into a community and to enhance the use of Japanese as a means of self-expression for learners. The results of the study show that the learners developed a sense of community in the classroom through a variety of activities in the revision course. One of the new roles introduced for this study, the role of the nicchoku, had a significant effect on making classroom interaction learner-centred and authentic. Under the leadership of the nicchoku, other learners engaged in learning activities, while the teacher stepped aside to take a support role. The nicchoku altered the typical teacher-fronted classroom sequence of Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) and helped redistribute classroom turns more evenly among classroom members. The study suggests that interactions are important not only to learn language but also to build human relationships. Thus, if the course aims to build both language proficiency and a learning community, it is necessary to create a variety of interaction opportunities in the classroom so that learners can acquire interactional competence/social skills to build a good relationship in a target language in/outside of the classroom. The results of the SPOT show a significant improvement in the Japanese proficiency of all the learners in the revision course. In addition, the study described an acquisition process of the verb ??ogoru?? as an example. The learners encountered the expression, learned its linguistic structure, applied it to a variety of contexts to learn its usage, and used it as a means of self-expression. The process showed that using the linguistic structure as a means of self-expression occurred through, first, acquisition of the linguistic structure, second, exposure to appropriate applications including sociolinguistic aspects in a given context and, third, experiences of a variety of interactions though activities. Thus, all stages of classroom activities are necessary to help learners enhance their ability to use Japanese as a means of self-expression. These findings suggest the classroom can provide learners with opportunities to use Japanese as a means of self-expression if the roles and activities in the classroom are carefully designed to bring learners into learner-centred interaction sequences, which are both qualitatively and quantitatively different from the typical teacher-fronted IRF sequences. In addition, the study indicates that learning a foreign language and becoming a language user is a complex and dynamic process of learners participating in communities that are created, maintained, and changed by their members, the acquisition of linguistic structures and appropriate application to context, and individual learners?? personal attributes and experience.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Language user</field><field name="subject">Japanese language</field><field name="subject">Sociocultural approach</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Community</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43588</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does meditation have a specific effect?: a systematic experimental evaluation of a mental silence orientated definition</field><field name="creator">Manocha, Ramesh, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Meditation and its underlying ideas are increasingly popular in Western society but the practice itself has been subjected to little high quality scientific scrutiny. In this thesis I describe the outcomes of a research programme aimed at addressing this deficiency. A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the entire English-speaking database of randomised controlled trials clearly demonstrates that the extant data is characterised by a number of methodological and conceptual flaws. As a result there is currently no consistent evidence of a specific effect associated with meditation. The most fundamentally important of these flaws, I propose, is the lack of a consistent and meaningful definition of meditation. Exploring the original descriptions of the meditative experience reveals that a key feature of meditation is the experience of mental silence. Despite this, Western definitions characterise meditation as a method of relaxation, focusing of attention or cognitive modification. The poor performance of meditation in scientific studies may be explained by the fact that definitions of meditation used by Western scientists do not appear to reflect the understanding of meditation as described in the Eastern traditions from which it originated. To explore the salience of the mental silence concept I first conducted a survey of 348 meditators who used a single homogenous form of meditation called Sahaja Yoga which focuses on the experience of mental silence as its defining feature, to assess their functional health and its relationship with their meditative practices. This survey demonstrated that these meditators had not only better mental and physical health but also that a consistent relationship between health, especially mental health, and selfreported experience of mental silence existed. To investigate the possibility of whether or not this relationship was causal, a series of increasingly rigorous clinical studies were implemented. Two separate observational and case control studies of participants suffering from 1) menopausal symptoms, and 2) attention deficit hyperactivity disorder demonstrated promising outcomes. These were followed by a small but well-designed RCT of meditation for asthma, then the largest RCT of meditation for occupational stress currently in the literature. The latter two studies were specifically designed to exclude non-specific ??placebo?? effects. The outcomes of these studies provided strong evidence that mental silence is associated with a specific, therapeutic effect. Finally, in a heuristic physiological study mental silence meditators manifested reductions in skin temperature during meditation thereby contradicting the ??reduced physiological arousal?? conceptualisation of meditation. This and other data are discussed and the possibility that the mental silence experience is associated with a unique pattern of physiological activity is proposed. In conclusion, there is credible evidence to support the idea that Sahaja Yoga meditation, and hence the mental silence experience that typifies it, is associated with unique effects. The ramifications for the fields of meditation research, consciousness and religious studies and healthcare are discussed. Future studies are proposed that focus on further examination of the mental silence state and potential mechanisms by which its specific effects may occur with emphasis on immunogenetic markers and neuroimaging.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Meditation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43564</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional regulation of the human cytochrome P450 2J2 gene by activator protein-1</field><field name="creator">Marden, Nicole Yvonne, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of enzymes catalyses the oxidative metabolism of lipophilic xenobiotics such as drugs and environmental chemicals, and also plays an essential role in the biosynthesis and metabolism of endogenous compounds such as cholesterol and bile acids, vitamins, steroids, arachidonic acid and eicosanoids. Cytochrome P450 2J2 (CYP2J2) is a recently identified member of the human CYP protein family that is highly expressed in the heart, vasculature, liver and other tissues. CYP2J2 metabolises arachidonic acid (AA) into epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which have a number of potent biological activities including cytoprotective, vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Given its widespread tissue distribution and the biological actions of EETs, CYP2J2 is likely to play an important role in cellular physiology, and altered expression of CYP2J2 may have pathophysiological consequences. Indeed, recent literature studies have indicated that CYP2J2 protein levels are decreased in vascular endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia and reoxygenation, and that maintenance of CYP2J2 expression enhances cell survival. Thus, CYP2J2 expression may be impaired in diseases or conditions associated with decreased oxygen availability, such as ischaemic heart disease, stroke and atherosclerosis, and this may contribute to their pathogenic consequences. Despite its likely importance in human physiology and pathophysiology, very little is known about the regulation of CYP2J2 gene expression. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms that control expression of the CYP2J2 gene. In particular, this study was designed to identify factors that regulate the expression of the CYP2J2 gene in the liver-derived HepG2 cell line during normoxia and hypoxia. A 2.4 kb fragment of the 5???-flanking region of the CYP2J2 gene (corresponding to nucleotides -2341 to +98, relative to the translation start site) was isolated from a human genomic library. Automated searching of the upstream regulatory region of CYP2J2 identified several putative binding sites for the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1). Because AP-1 activity is altered in hypoxia, the possibility that AP-1 may participate in the regulation of CYP2J2 expression in hypoxia was explored. Cell culture studies examined the relationship between the expression of CYP2J2, and the  AP-1 genes c-fos and c-jun, in HepG2 cells cultured in normoxia and hypoxia. Down-regulation of CYP2J2 mRNA and protein in hypoxic HepG2 cells was associated with the pronounced up-regulation of c-Fos protein from an undetectable level in normoxic cells; c-Jun protein levels were readily detectable in normoxia, and were also increased in hypoxia. Transient transfection studies revealed distinct effects of Fos and Jun proteins on CYP2J2 promoter activity. While the CYP2J2 promoter was strongly activated by c-Jun, c-Fos was inactive, and also abolished gene transactivation elicited by c-Jun. These results suggest that the constitutively expressed c-Jun is important in the maintenance of CYP2J2 expression in normoxic cells. The up-regulation of c-Fos in hypoxia stimulates the formation of c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers, which do not support CYP2J2 transcription, leading to gene down-regulation. Experiments with CYP2J2 promoter deletion constructs revealed that the region between -152 to -50 bp relative to the translation start site was crucial for activation of CYP2J2 by c-Jun. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and transfection studies identified two distinct elements within this region that were involved in c-Jun-dependent transactivation: an AP-1-like element at -56 to -63 bp, and an atypical AP-1 element at -105 to -95 bp. c-Jun homodimers interacted specifically with both elements. Separate mutagenesis of either element significantly impaired c-Jun-dependent transactivation of CYP2J2, while mutagenesis of both elements eliminated c-Jun-responsiveness. EMSAs established that c-Jun, but not c-Fos, interacted with both elements in normoxic HepG2 cells. Furthermore, mutagenesis of either c-Jun-response element significantly decreased the basal transcriptional activity of the CYP2J2 promoter in HepG2 cells, while mutagenesis of both elements almost completely suppressed basal promoter activity. These findings indicate a pivotal role for c-Jun in the maintenance of CYP2J2 expression in normoxic cells. Transfection studies indicated that c-Fos suppresses c-Jun-dependent activation of CYP2J2 at both the -56/-63 bp and -105/-95 bp c-Jun-response elements. However, c-Fos-dependent inhibition appears to be mediated by distinct mechanisms at these two regulatory elements. While both elements interacted with c-Jun homodimers, only the -105/-95 bp element was able to interact with c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers. Thus, the up-regulation of c-Fos in hypoxia, and the shift from c-Jun homodimers to c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers, directly decreased c-Jun binding and transactivation at the -56/-63 bp element. In contrast, up-regulation of c-Fos in hypoxia altered the composition of proteins bound at the -105/-95 bp element from c-Jun to c-Fos/c-Jun. Inhibition of promoter activity occurs because c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers can occupy, but not transactivate, the CYP2J2 promoter via the -105/-95 bp element.  In summary, this thesis provides novel information on the molecular mechanisms that control the differential expression of the human CYP2J2 gene in normoxia and hypoxia. In particular, this study has established that the AP-1 proteins c-Jun and c-Fos play a crucial role in modulating the transcriptional activation of the CYP2J2 promoter in response to cellular stress. Binding of c-Jun to two distinct c-Jun-response elements within the CYP2J2 proximal promoter induces transcriptional activation of the CYP2J2 gene and is essential for maintenance of CYP2J2 expression in normoxic cells. The up-regulation of c-Fos in hypoxia promotes the formation of c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers, which inhibit transcriptional activation of the CYP2J2 promoter by c-Jun, thus contributing to decreased CYP2J2 expression in hypoxia. Impaired expression of CYP2J2 may contribute to cellular injury in diseases such as atherosclerosis and stroke, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms responsible for mediating altered CYP2J2 expression may eventually lead to therapeutic strategies that manipulate the expression of this important human gene.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">protein</field><field name="subject">cytochrome P-450</field><field name="subject">genetic transcription</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design, construction and control of an industrial scale biped robot</field><field name="creator">Cronin, Joe, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A 500Kg, self-contained biped robot, named Roboshift, has been conceived and tested to investigate issues associated with the control of industrial scale biped robots. This project represents the first credible attempt to build a heavy weight autonomous biped robot. The recent expansion in humanoid robot development has highlighted advances made in anthropomorphic biped technology. Current research into speech recognition, vision systems, laser topography, artificial intelligence and electroactive polymers will ultimately achieve an Android capable of human like actions and thought processes. Justification for this most demanding and expensive research is based on philanthropic models that suggest these robots will attend to the bedridden, or replace humans in dangerous areas. However, the cost of a biped robot when compared to that of a wheeled or tracked vehicle restricts commercialisation for these applications. As well, the size and working capacity of current humanoid robots is not compatible with the heavy lifting requirements found in such environments. It is proposed that only biped robots of an industrial scale, possessing a capacity much greater than that of a human, will be of commercial value in the future. Typical applications may include the handling of materials in confined or uneven terrain, where a forklift or other commercially available materials handling equipment would be unsuitable. For example, field handling in military, mining or geological environments. Minimal research has been conducted into the realisation of such a device, which presents challenges in terms of the magnitude of dynamic forces produced and of the systems required to control the robot in real-time. Review of relevant literature reveals that little research has been completed in this field. Therefore, operational characteristics for an industrial scale biped robot are defined. The design then details the structure and integration of mechanical, hydraulic, and electrical systems. Roboshift is powered by an internal combustion engine and is the first biped robot with a capacity for extended operation. Modelling was conducted to determine joint trajectories, power requirements, hydraulic flow parameters and dynamic characteristics. The robot is controlled by a distributed, hierarchical system comprising sixteen microprocessors, a control computer acting as the midbrain and a communications computer acting as the central nervous system. Sensors measure attitude and heading (vestibular system) as well as ground reaction forces and joint angles (propreoception). The control strategy is based on feed forward trajectories generated by inverse kinematic analysis. Corrections to trajectories are made in real time by higher level routines running on the main control computer. Joint position is achieved by local feedback control. Software for the robot was written in the C language. Experimental results are presented detailing the performance of the robot in comparison to theoretical analysis. After construction and testing of actuators and sensors, calibration software was tested successfully. Once calibrated, the robot was lowered to the ground where the active balance software was able to control the robot in the frontal and sagittal planes. Frontal sway software was tested with mixed success as natural oscillation of the structure, which was not detectable by the control system, led to erroneous force data. Detailed dynamic modelling was then completed to determine the causes of oscillation in the robot. The modelling led to the formulation of a control strategy where non-collocated sensors are used to measure link strain as a feedback to a modified proportional controller. The project has demonstrated that an industrial scale biped incorporating an internal combustion engine and hydraulic power system is feasible.. Analysis presented proposes that as the height of a biped robot increases, the expected elastic deformation of the structure increases as the cube of the height, making control extremely challenging. A strategy for the control of heavy-weight robots is suggested It is also proposed that technology incorporated in current humanoid robots can not be scaled to control industrial bipeds.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">robots</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Can government influence the effective development and implementation of hospital admission policy?</field><field name="creator">Wolk, Jael, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">It has consistently been documented in many countries and sectors that there are difficulties in implementing public policy effectively. A priori, the Australian health care system is no exception to this general proposition. While governments issue directives with particular goals in mind these goals are not always met, because of the modifications, interpretations or lack of uptake by targeted populations. However it is not clear the extent to which these difficulties occur in the public hospital sector, and we lack clear empirical data on this phenomenon. This thesis investigates the effects of a state government directive on the development and implementation of elective admission policies in New South Wales public hospitals. It did this by three separate but related studies that examined the impact of the directive at the hospitals??? management and staff levels. The first two studies were quantitative and qualitative surveys of hospital managers and admission staff. The management survey aimed to ascertain the extent to which managers responded to the directive in terms of developing and implementing hospital policies. The staff survey sought to investigate staff awareness and knowledge of the developed policies. The third study was a qualitative analysis of the policy contents to determine the extent to which they reflected the aims and objectives of the government directive guidelines. All three studies found a general lack of relevance and applicability of the government directive and its guidelines to individual hospital organisations. The manager survey showed a disconnection between the central government office responsible for implementing the directive and hospital managers??? perspectives. This was apparent by the lack of response to the directive by many hospitals and the fact that managers often passed on the task of implementing the  directive and its guidelines to other hospital staff. The findings of the qualitative analysis of policies showed evidence of hospital strategies to manage pressures created by the directive. These difficulties were corroborated by the surveyed staff that reported difficulties in translating the directive???s requirements (as reflected by the hospital policy), into the reality of their daily work; a lack of organisational commitment to policy enforcement; and a suspicion regarding the directive???s political motives. The findings of this thesis show that, as with other public service sectors effective policy implementation in the public hospital arena is problematic, with government agendas frequently not aligned with the requirements of stakeholders, and inadequate understanding of implementation barriers. Recommendations are made regarding methods to improve the synchronicity of political directives with organisational realties in the public hospital sector.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hospitals</field><field name="subject">administration</field><field name="subject">admission and discharge</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23398</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abjection : weapon of the weak</field><field name="creator">Victor, Suzann</field><field name="description">This research considers the performance of situated subjectivity where the state and the individual vie for dominion over the drives that construct the body as what one has (the body as object), as what one is (the body as subject), and as what one becomes (the absent body). To turn power into pain, the State prospects the body of the subject to anchor its power through abjection. In so doing, it compels that body to channel the abject as a power to be wielded as a weapon of the weak, thus forcing into view the true interior of the State. Sections I and II position a discourse of trauma in Singapore using a parenthetical framework that is constructed by and mediated through the criminalized and punishable bodies of two young Asian males. The first discusses the carefully constructed ob-scene (off-stage) nature of the obscene (abhorrent) execution of convicted drug trafficker Van Nguyen in 2005 (the body as object); the second examines its inverse &#8211; the public spectacle of creative &#8216;death&#8217; imposed upon artist Josef Ng (the body as subject) through government condemnation and expulsion for an alleged obscene (immoral) performance at 5th Passage in 1994. To do this, the thesis engages with the enforced interchangeable processes of disembodiment (for the display of symbolic violence) and embodiment (for the exertion of physical violence). Comparisons are also made of the way the State demonstrates its preparedness to turn the display of power into a process of exacting the ultimate pain from the punishable body. This is perpetrated on the one hand via a spectacle of invisibility that keeps the mandatory death penalty a secretive process, and on the other, its inverse, the publicly staged media spectacle of persecuting performance artist/s and 5th Passage. The events that follow led to the defacto banning of performance art and 5th Passage&#8217;s demise in 1994, ending my role as its artistic director. By relocating the performance of death from the high courts and offices of Singapore&#8217;s Home Affairs Ministry (the site of symbolic violence) and Changi Prison (site of physical violence) into plain sight in the Australian media, the press is discussed as an instrumental force in deploying a penal counter-aesthetic to pierce through Singapore&#8217;s veil of secrecy surrounding its executions. The thesis demonstrates how this engendered a &#8216;seeing through&#8217; that galvanized acts of intersubjectivity and the performance of social witnessing in Australia as an attempt to save Van Nguyen from the gallows. The institutional censorship of an artwork about the execution in 2005 is discussed to show how signifying practices such as visual art continued to agitate the state&#8217;s performance to construct itself as a &#8220;global city for arts and culture&#8221; on one hand while crushing artistic subjectivity when it is perceived as dissent on the other. This glimpse into the fragility of the Singapore nation&#8217;s divergent desires, where one performance portrays the disintegration of another, recalled the originary cultural rupture at 5th Passage in 1994 when artists engaged in performance were sensationalized in the Singapore media as social deviants. As an extension of state apparatus, the media is shown to repress artistic subjectivity through its creation of a controversy that led to the illegitimization of scriptless performance art, thus producing a distinctively Singaporean cultural artefact &#8211; the absent body. Out of the personal and social trauma framed by this confrontation with the state, Section III presents a body of visual work that I have since produced in the period marked by these two events (between 1994 to 2008) as a reply to the state. From this place of banishment, the thesis traces its evolvement into the body machine (Rich Manoeuvre series) as part of a practice that sees it for what it is within the paternal order, to locate the points where fragility occur.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">abjection</field><field name="subject">kinetic installation art</field><field name="subject">body</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">arts</field><field name="subject">political aspects</field><field name="subject">censorship</field><field name="subject">performance art</field><field name="subject">art and state</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/39710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Auditory manipulation of visual perception</field><field name="creator">Wilkie, Sonia</field><field name="description">Psychological research on cross-modal auditory-visual perception has focused predominantly on the manipulation of sensory information by visual information. There are relatively few studies of the way auditory stimuli may affect other sensory information. The Sound-induced Illusory Flash is one illusory paradigm that involves the auditory system biasing visual information. However, little is known about this cross-modal illusion. More research is needed into the structure of the illusion that investigates the different conditions under which the Sound induced Illusory Flash manifests and is enhanced or reduced. The research conducted for this thesis investigates the effect of new auditory stimulus variables on the Sound-induced Illusory Flash. The variables to be discussed concern the formation of a contrast in the auditory stimuli, with the contrast creating a rhythm that emphasises the discontinuous nature of the auditory stimuli, and therefore emphasises the illusory percept. The auditory stimulus contrasts include pitch separation with the octave interval, using the frequencies of 261.5 and 523Hz; and spatial separation in the auditory stimuli, presenting the monophonic auditory stimuli binaurally so that individual tones alternate between the left and right channels. I furthered this concept of auditory stimuli separation biasing an illusory percept, by investigating pitch and spatial presentation and localisation of the visual stimuli presentation, when multiple dots were presented. I also conducted analyses to determine if factors other than the auditory stimuli biased the illusory percept. These included the use of non-illusory trials and determining if their inclusion biased the illusory trial percept; and the impact of physical factors such as handedness, eye dominance, corrected vision, and musical experience on the illusory percept. My ultimate aim is to develop the illusory effect as a basis for new intermedia techniques to create the perceptual synchronisation of sound with images. These would be perceived as visually spliced according to the rhythm of the music on the micro time scale.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">visual perception</field><field name="subject">auditory perception</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">psychoacoustics</field><field name="subject">Sound-induced Illusory Flash</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/39802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Can a moment of time exist on a two-dimensional surface?</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, Mary</field><field name="description">This exegesis forms part of an ongoing enquiry on the concept of time.

R.</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates not so much the engineer as a character in fiction but the writer of fiction, the novelist, as a person who can have surprising insights into engineering principles without formal study or training in engineering. The engineer has featured in fiction novels significantly in the last century. The engineer as a protagonist in the novel on many occasions has been created by an author who is not an engineer. The same comment could well be made regarding the writers of science fiction who indeed are not necessarily scientists but write credibly about scientific inventions, usually set in the future. This thesis argues that there is a distinction between writing science fiction and writing about engineering, although the two are often combined in the one novel. This thesis distinguishes science fiction (Sci-Fi) from what is described as En-Fi or engineering fiction. Engineering fiction or En-Fi is based upon real life engineering feats, if one accepts that the definition of engineering is the &#8220;application&#8221; of science and technology. The specific hypothesis of this thesis is that credible engineering fiction (En- Fi) can be constructed by non-engineer trained authors. To support this hypothesis there is both a review of novels with the engineer as a central character and an examination of novels where engineering concepts used in developing a storyline are outlined in detail. Indeed, to support the above hypothesis a supplementary &#8220;En-Fi&#8221; novel has been created. This novel, titled, &#8220;Amber Reins Fall&#8221;, is used as the central device in addition to the literature review to prove that a writer untrained in engineering can write an En-Fi novel that has a high degree of credibility in engineering terms. The construction of this engineering fiction (En-Fi) novel is carried out in detail outlining the various engineering devices used to strengthen the storyline. Examples of engineering such as a light engineering factory of the 1950&#8217;s, operational aspects of the Panama Canal and the disposal of nuclear waste in the Australian desert are included in the novel. Three other novels by the author (of this thesis) are included as part of the argument supporting the hypothesis. They also demonstrate the combination of En-Fi and Sci-Fi. In the first novel &#8220;Greenwars&#8221; (d&#8217;ettut 1998) the overriding engineering component is AARDVARK (accelerated animal reasoning, decision making, voicing and reflective kinetics); the interactive voting video and dolphin scooters. The second novel &#8220;Pie Square&#8221; (d&#8217;ettut 2000) has as the major engineering component the interactive video games. The third novel, &#8220;Vampire Cities&#8221; (d&#8217;ettut 2000) has as the major engineering component a conductor&#8217;s baton (although this might be construed as science fiction). Two of the actual novels, &#8220;Greenwars&#8221; and &#8220;Pie Square&#8221; have been appended as part of the thesis presentation. They both deal with the central character &#8220;Adam Teforp&#8221;, also featured in &#8220;Amber Reins Fall&#8221;. &#8220;Vampire Cities&#8221; has not been appended as this critical character is not part of that novel. The literature review and the construction of &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;Amber Reins Fall&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; point to the validity of the hypothesis; that is that non-engineers can write convincing engineering orientated novels. Its also asserted that there is sufficient evidence to recognize a genre called En-Fi, different from the science fiction genre.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">engineering in literature</field><field name="subject">engineers in literature</field><field name="subject">engineering</field><field name="subject">engineers</field><field name="subject">English fiction</field><field name="subject">science fiction</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/39903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolving spiking neural networks for adaptive audiovisual pattern recognition</field><field name="creator">Wysoski, Simei Gomes</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents new modular and integrative information methods and systems inspired by the way the brain performs information processing, in particular, pattern recognition. The proposed artificial systems use spiking neurons as basic elements, which are the key components of spiking neural networks. Of particular interest to this research are various spiking neural network architectures and learning procedures that permit different pattern recognition problems to be solved in an evolvable and adaptive way. Spiking neural networks are used to model human visual and auditory pathways and are trained to perform the specific task of person authentication. The systems are individually tuned and trained to recognize facial information and to analyze sound signals from spoken sentences. The modelling of the integration of different sources of information (multisensory integration) using spiking neural networks is also a subject of investigation. A network architecture is proposed and a model for audiovisual pattern recognition is designed as an example. The main original contributions of this thesis are: a) Evaluation and further extension of adaptive learning procedures to perform visual pattern recognition. A new learning procedure that enables the system to change its structure, creating/merging neuronal maps of spiking neurons is presented and evaluated on a face recognition problem. b) Design of two new spiking neural network architectures to perform person authentication through the processing of speech signals. c) Design and evaluation of a new architecture that integrates sensory modalities based on spiking neurons. The integrative architecture combines opinions from individual modalities within a supramodal layer, which contains neurons sensitive to multiple sensory information. An additional feature that increases biological relevance is the crossmodal coupling of modalities, which effectively enables a given sensory modality to exert direct influence upon the processing areas typically related to other modalities. The contributions were published in one journal paper and in four refereed international conference proceedings. The proposed system designs were implemented and, through computer simulations, demonstrated comparable performance with traditional benchmarking methods. The systems have some promising features: they can be naturally optimized in respect to different criteria: accuracy (when very accurate results are expected), energy efficiency (when management of resources play an important role), and speed (when a decision needs to be made within a limited time). In this thesis, most of the parameters have been exhaustively optimized by hand or by using simple heuristics. As a direction for future work, there is an opportunity to include automated, specially tailored parameters optimization procedures or even general-purpose optimization algorithms, e.g., Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization. Overall, the results obtained in this thesis clearly indicate that it is indeed possible to have fast and accurate adaptive pattern recognition systems scalable for multiple modalities computing with simple models of spiking neurons. However, it is important to advance the theory of spiking neurons to take advantage of its biological relevance to reach similar or better performance when compared to the human brain, for instance, exploring new neuron models, information coding schemes and network connectivity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">Visual pattern recognition</field><field name="subject">Auditory pattern recognition</field><field name="subject">Experimentation and quantitative evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/390</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the teacher-student relationship in teacher education: a hermeneutic phenomenological inquiry</field><field name="creator">Giles, David Laurance</field><field name="description">The relationship between teacher and student has always been a central interest of the educational process.  While the nature of this relationship can be understood from various theoretical frameworks, research that seeks to understand the &#8220;lived experience&#8221; of this relationship is less prevalent.  This research explores the phenomenological nature of the teacher-student relationship in the context of teacher education.  Stories of the lived experience of this relationship were hermeneutically interpreted against the philosophical writings of Heidegger, Gadamer, and Buber. The research answers the question: what is the meaning of the teacher-student relationship?  Relationships are essential to the educational experience whether this is recognised or not, and whether we are consciously aware of this or not.  Once established, relationships continue to exist beyond the time and space of the individuals influencing future relational experiences.  In addition, a teacher&#8217;s comportment has been found to have a communicative aspect that is felt and sensed by others. A further essential understanding opens the play of relating.  That is, the teacher and student experience their relationship as a play that is unscripted, uncertain, and lived beyond the rules of engagement.  In this play, teachers who are attuned to relationship show a phronesis, or practical wisdom, as they relate moment by moment. The outcomes of this research call into question technicist and instrumental models of teacher education which are presently underpinned by the dominant neoliberal ideology.  Consistent with critical and humanistic approaches to education, this research calls for the humanising of the educational experience through the educating and re-educating of teacher educators and teachers towards essential understandings of relationship.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Relationship</field><field name="subject">Hermeneutic</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Heidegger</field><field name="subject">Gadamer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of the conflict resolution questionnaire</field><field name="creator">Henning, Marcus</field><field name="description">Many questionnaires used in the measurement of conflict are expensive and difficult to obtain. In addition, instruments of this kind are usually associated with diagnosis rather than intervention and education. The present thesis evaluates the recently developed questionnaire that is easily accessible through the Internet, the Conflict Resolution Questionnaire (CRQ). The CRQ was developed as a measure of the conflict resolution ideas presented by Weeks (1994), and Fisher and Ury (1991). It has been used to measure a person's ability to create mutually beneficial resolutions to conflict for all participants. In addition, the CRQ items measure respondents' perceptions regarding how often they engage in certain conflict-related behaviours, and their level of awareness regarding conflict issues. The CRQ is also designed to promote understanding of conflict, and has been used as an educational tool. Participants were asked to fill in the CRQ alongside an established questionnaire, the Rahim Organisational Conflict Inventory, part two (ROCI-II) (Rahim, 1983a). The responses of 338 participants to the CRQ and ROCI-II were statistically analysed. Hypotheses were tested regarding the CRQ's reliability and validity. CRQ reliability was statistically appraised through exploration of internal consistency and split-half reliability scores. CRQ validity was examined by evaluating the CRQ in terms of content, construct and concurrent validity. Establishing content validity was a qualitative process. Corroborating construct validity essentially relied on factor analysis procedures. Decisions regarding CRQ's concurrent validity were based upon correlation measures between the CRQ and the ROCI-II, which was used as an established standard measure of conflict. The results confirmed that two of the McClellan's (1997c) factors were reliable and that the CRQ had content validity. There was marginal support of construct validity, whereby from the factor rotation it was shown that two of the CRQ factors were matched by their derived counterparts. In addition, the results showed modest support for concurrent validity based on the comparisons of three CRQ factors against two factors from a well-established questionnaire. These findings also lend support for the methods of conflict resolution presented in the works of Weeks (1994) and Fisher and Ury (1991).A modified version of the CRQ is presented, the 'CRQ-II'. A posthoc analysis suggests that the CRQ-II can satisfy psychometric requirements, although further research is recommended to confirm the CRQ-II. Practice implications regarding the development of the CRQ-II are discussed, and future research considerations are explored.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conflict management</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/49</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Fiji 2000 coup: a media analysis</field><field name="creator">Gounder, Christine</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the role of both the local and international media during the May 2000 coup, to determine whether the coverage was fair and to suggest solutions for the future. It will first discuss and compare literature that has been written on the Fiji coups, focusing on literature on the media and the coups in particular. According to Fowler (1991) the role of a journalist is to collect facts, report them objectively and present them fairly and without bias in language which is designed to be unambiguous, undistorting and agreeable to readers. However, in most times this is not the case. A thematic content analysis will be done on news articles that appeared in The Fiji Times, The New Zealand Herald and The Australian to find common themes during the coverage of the crisis. A lot of criticism of the both the local and international media&#8217;s role during the May 2000 coup emerged after the crisis. Critics included editors and journalists of the local and international media and political and historical analysts who knew the &#8216;real reasons&#8217; behind the coup and did not see this being reported. A summary of interviews with journalists and editors who covered the coup, both local and overseas, will give an insight into their thoughts and reactions during the coup. It will also determine whether the journalists suffered from the Stockholm syndrome. The Stockholm syndrome describes the behaviour of kidnap victims or people who associate a lot with the captors, and who over time become sympathetic to their captors. The name is derived from a 1973 hostage siege in Stockholm, Sweden when at the end of six days of captivity at a bank; several kidnap victims actually resisted rescue attempts, and afterwards refused to testify against their captors. During the Fiji coup, apart from Speights supporters, journalists were the only ones who spent a lot of time with the coup leader either at press conferences or staying at Parliament to get good stories. As a result, some journalists began to &#8216;sway&#8217; towards Speight or began to experience the Stockholm  syndrome which was reflected in their stories. The thesis concludes that a few journalists in Fiji did suffer from the Stockholm syndrome. It also concludes that a crisis manual is needed for media organisations in Fiji to avoid the same mistakes being repeated as in the last three coups. The overseas media on the other hand need to attach themselves to the local media to avoid parachute journalism and inaccurate reporting. Overseas media organisations need to assign special reporters to Pacific Island affairs to understand the culture and other complex issues which would help in reporting their issues fairly and accurately.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiji</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Coup d'&#233;tat, 2000</field><field name="subject">Press coverage</field><field name="subject">Media</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/77</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of how product involvement affects brand loyalty</field><field name="creator">Douglas, Nigel</field><field name="description">David Aaker (1992) suggests that brand loyalty leads to brand equity, which leads to business profitability. Brand loyalty makes a critically valuable contribution to competitive advantage. Marketing costs render it expensive to introduce new customers and loyal customers are less likely to switch brands. High brand loyalty is an asset that lends itself to extension, high market share, high return on investment and ultimately high brand equity (Gounaris &amp; Stathakopoulos, 2004). Understanding the drivers for brand loyalty is the first step to understanding how to influence them and thus increase profitability. The wider body of literature (Iwasaki &amp; Havitz, 1998; LeClerc &amp; Little, 1997; Park 1996) suggests that product involvement, particularly high product involvement is a critical antecedent to brand loyalty. Traylor (1983) and Martin (2004) argue that low involvement products are also significant. Quester and Lim (2003) published a paper that empirically tested the relationship between product involvement and brand loyalty. They hypothesized that high involvement would lead to high brand loyalty and vice versa but their research showed that low involvement products could have high brand loyalty too. Further analysis of the literature shows support for product involvement as an antecedent to brand loyalty but still the nature and scope of this relationship remains uncertain. Therefore this research sets out to replicate and extend Quester and Lim's study. To extend the body of literature this research selected cars and batteries from Mittal's (1989a) predetermined list of product categories to represent high and low involvement products. The research then sourced Kapferer and Laurent's (1985b) seminal Consumer Involvement Profile as a basis for the product involvement scale for the survey. The CIP scale breaks product involvement down to five antecedents; interest, pleasure, sign, risk probability and risk importance. Similarly, Dick and Basu's (1994) work formed the basis of the scales as they related to brand loyalty. Dick and Basu suggest that brand loyalty consists of both behavioural and attitudinal components, which in turn consist of cognitive, affective and co native antecedents. These variables formed the basis of the survey used for empirical testing. Data was collected and analysed using factor and multiple regression analysis. Data analysis returned five factors for product involvement for cars and four for product involvement for batteries where Quester and Lim (2003) only returned four factors for both categories. This research also returned all three factors for cars and two for batteries, suggesting that the subjects of this research were able to discern the subtleties of the antecedents to brand loyalty where Quester and Lim's were not. Finally, the research tested these factors for regression correlations to identify links between pleasure, sign and risk probability and brand loyalty for cars and interest/pleasure, sign, risk probability and risk importance for batteries. The analysis shows that these findings explained more than 53% of the variances for batteries and more than 71% of the variances for cars suggesting that product involvement makes a significant contribution to brand loyalty. While these findings lend support for product involvement as an antecedent to brand loyalty, sign value is the only construct that shows a consistent correlation. Thus there is still an opportunity for more academic research. For marketers the message is clear, sign value or ego involvement shows a clear correlation with brand loyalty. Any attempt to grow brand loyalty must at least acknowledge this issue.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The experience of novice hospital play specialists in their early months of employment</field><field name="creator">Kayes, Marianne</field><field name="description">This study explores the day-to-day lived experience of eight novice hospital play specialists in New Zealand, during the early months following their appointment. Hospital play specialists come from a background in early childhood teaching and work as members of paediatric healthcare teams to support development and coping in hospitalised children and young people. Participants' stories were gathered in face-to-face interviews and were then analysed using an interpretive approach informed by Heideggerian hermeneutic phenomenology. Throughout the reflective process of the study, I have sought to show the vividness of the participants&#8217; unique experiences whilst revealing the deeper understandings that lie below. This study shows that experiences as a novice matter to the subsequent development of professional identity as a hospital play specialist. The participants' early impressions of tile world of a hospital are shown in the findings to be those of strangers arriving in a foreign country, struggling to survive and to achieve a sense of belonging. Despite initially feeling lost and vulnerable, they are revealed as resourcefU1 in coping with change, and resilient in acquiring new skills, finding support, building relationships, and adapting their practice. Inclusion within healthcare teams, and recognition of their knowledge and skills by the participants and by their healthcare colleagues, contribute to participants' successful transitions from novice to competent practitioners. There are implications in this study for team leaders, managers and hospital play specialists regarding recruitment and support, such as ensuring that those employed show the flexibility needed for this role and are the11 provided with suitable early information and induction programmes Alongside this is the need for a focus on professional development and improved processes of communication, and inclusion of new staff members within the healthcare team.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Recreational therapy for children</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring physiotherapists' participation in peer review in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rolland, Ta-Mera Cherina</field><field name="description">This qualitative, descriptive study explored physiotherapists' experience of participating in peer review in public and private health services in New Zealand. Peer review is a professional activity where one health practitioner evaluates the practice of another. Accordingly, much professional effort has been expended on developing peer review systems and implementing review processes, yet the benefits of peer review are uncertain. A changing legislative environment where producing evidence of ongoing professional development is required, has provided impetus for this study given the limited research to support the use of peer review in this context. While the literature identifies competing focuses on professional development and accountability, there is lack of clarity about which model of peer review is being implemented in this country and which might serve the profession better. This study is a first step in clarifying the issues by identifying the personal, professional and organisational factors that influence health professionals' participation in peer review. The methodology consisted of a qualitative descriptive approach situated within a post positivist paradigm. Seven physiotherapists working in the New Zealand health system who had participated in a peer review process within the last 3 years participated in this study. Semi structured interviews were conducted, guided by broad questions relating to central themes identified during an extensive literature review. Interviews were then audio taped and transcribed verbatim to form the data. Transcripts were analysed by assigning content labels to units of text that seemed to encapsulate one complete thought or idea. The labelled groups were analysed into sub themes. Finally, the general themes that arose were described. Findings indicate that while peer review systems have been developed and are carried out as prescribed, therapists lack clarity about the intended outcomes. While recognising the benefits of receiving feedback on practice, many manage the review process to maintain positive working relationships and ensure their practice is favourably reviewed. The strategies they employ and the consequences of managing peer review in these ways are described. Current peer review processes in New Zealand do not provide reliable information about competence to practice. Neither do they fully achieve their potential as a professional development tool. Therefore, the professional emphasis and effort on peer review needs to be revisited. The findings highlight the need for consultation amongst individual physiotherapists, physiotherapy managers, physiotherapy professional organisations, and the registration board, to negotiate whether regulatory or professional development needs will drive peer review processes in New Zealand in the future.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative descriptive</field><field name="subject">Physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Peer review</field><field name="subject">Quality assurance</field><field name="subject">HPCA</field><field name="subject">Professional development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facing up to cancer: the lived experience of being diagnosed with a life threatening form of cancer</field><field name="creator">Lothian, Neil</field><field name="description">This Heideggerian phenomenological hermeneutic study explores the lived experience of those coming to terms with the diagnosis of a life-threatening form of cancer. It offers an interpretation of the narratives of eight adult New Zealanders, three men and five women, aged between 25 and 60 years of age who had been recently diagnosed. The study, based upon van Manen's (1990) six-step method, uncovers the experience of the person facing up to being told they have a life-threatening form of cancer within New Zealand society. It is informed by the writing of Heidegger. The study explores the meaning of cancer to the person involved and how this meaning affects them and their world. The study explores the changes within the person and how this change in the person subsequently changes the understanding they have of themselves and the world. The narratives of participants reveal a journey that is undertaken, a journey they thought they would never undertake and were not prepared to take. The cancer journey begins suddenly, is frightening in its intensity, towards a perceived destination of probable death. The real journey for many takes an unforeseen detour along the way, a detour of hope and eventual enlightenment. The final journey for all human beings will always end in death. The realisation that all human journeys must and do end in death and learning to live with the reality of this one fact in life is the major lesson learnt by those who experience the cancer journey. The journey is made more difficult and lonely by a society that wishes to fool itself that this journey does not happen or wishes to believe that one day this journey may be totally avoided. Society, and the people that make up society, need to face the reality of the cancer journey for many of its members in order to better prepare the person for the journey and to support the person while on this journey.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer - Psychological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Cancer - Patients - New Zealand.</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethnic minority migrant Chinese in New Zealand: a study into their acculturation and workplace interpersonal conflict experiences</field><field name="creator">McIntyre, Nancy</field><field name="description">This study makes an important academic contribution by adding a new dimension to the existing scholarly literature on the acculturative processes of immigrants through its findings from an investigation into ethnic minority migrant Chinese Chinese&#8217;s acculturation experiences in relation to workplace interpersonal conflict in New Zealand. The literature reviewed illustrates the complexities of the acculturation process for immigrants and is of prime importance and relevance to this study. The literature provides an informed academic foundation that aligns with the subject matter under study. The focus of this study is on the acculturation process experienced by ethnic minority migrant Chinese in New Zealand as they strive to adapt to various aspects of their new surroundings. The study inquires into whether the length of acculturation has an influence on ethnic minority migrant Chinese&#8217;s handling of workplace interpersonal conflict in the New Zealand. The researcher&#8217;s interest in conducting this study arises from her own personal acculturation and workplace interpersonal conflict experiences as an ethnic minority migrant Chinese. A phenomenological interpretive research methodology was adopted for this study. One-on-one indepth interviews of 25 ethnic minority migrant Chinese from China (Mainland), Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan,  and Vietnam provided primary data on the individual migrant&#8217;s experience and perspective on acculturation and workplace interpersonal conflict in New Zealand. The findings from the 25 ethnic minority migrant Chinese interviewed reveal the complexities and difficulties in the acculturation process, as they attempt to adapt to various aspects of their new environment. The adaptive strategies used almost certainly mean that the immigrants will have to make changes in their thinking, attitude, speech, and social conduct. There is a particular emphasis on the study of intercultural dynamics at play in the face of workplace interpersonal conflict between immigrants and members of the host society.  The acculturation process is made more difficult for migrants who have negative workplace encounters in their intercultural interactions resulting in misunderstandings and conflict. The findings also reveal the migrants&#8217; response mechanisms, particularly in learning to be more assertive. This study found that the cultural orientations of the ethnic migrant Chinese are such that for many, this concept (assertiveness) has to be learned since it runs counter to their educational, cultural tradition, and familial upbringing. The principles of Confucianism are deeply rooted, such as respect for authority and an emphasis on &#8216;giving-face&#8217; to others and preserving social harmony. From this study&#8217;s findings, there is empirical evidence that Confucian principles are deeply entrenched in the ethnic minority migrant Chinese&#8217; psyche irrespective of which country of origin they come from. In addition, the findings show that the acculturation experiences are unique to the individual migrant, depending on the person&#8217;s previous exposure to a foreign environment, language proficiency and personality. This study shows that the acculturation process experienced by these migrants was a period of personal growth and development, acquiring self-confidence, self-rationalisation, changes, and adjustments. Also, the findings reveal that while the length of residence in the host country is a significant factor for these migrants, other factors are significant as well, such as acquiring a certain level of language proficiency and increasing self-confidence.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Migrant</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">Acculturation</field><field name="subject">Workplace</field><field name="subject">Interpersonal relationships</field><field name="subject">Conflict</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research approach</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exposure assessment of traffic-related pm10 pollution in outdoor play areas of early childhood centres</field><field name="creator">Lyne, Mark</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to assess the exposure of children in outdoor play areas of early childhood centres in Auckland City to traffic-related PM10 pollution. An estimated 400 premature deaths occur each year in New Zealand due to motor vehicle emissions.  In addition to premature deaths, acute and chronic health effects including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease and bronchitis, as well as increased hospitalisations and restricted activity days (sick days) are also associated with vehicle emissions.  Epidemiological studies have shown that respiratory diseases such as asthma can be exacerbated by increases in the concentration of particulates of less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10) from motor vehicle emissions. Significant positive associations have been found between proximity to heavily travelled roads and increased childhood respiratory disease symptoms including hospitalisations for childhood asthma. In spite of this evidence, many early childhood centres in Auckland are located adjacent to busy roads. Children at these early childhood centres spend much of their time playing in the outdoor areas of these centres with the potential for particulates from motor vehicle emissions to exacerbate symptoms in those children already suffering from respiratory disease and asthma.  Very little research has been carried out either in New Zealand or internationally on the air quality of outdoor play areas of early childhood centres in relation to motor vehicle emissions and childhood respiratory disease and asthma. The extent of monitoring is also limited and the amount of exposure data available in New Zealand relatively sparse, particularly in comparison with Europe. Levels of traffic-related PM10 in the outdoor play areas of early childhood centres were measured in centres located adjacent to busy roads and in centres away from a quiet road or adjacent to a very quiet road for comparison.  Two of five early childhood centres located alongside busy roads had PM10 levels that exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline value. While PM10 levels monitored at the other three centres located alongside busy roads did not exceed the WHO guideline value, results were often only marginally within this guideline value. In contrast, PM10 levels monitored at two centres located away from a quiet road and one centre located adjacent to a very quiet road were well within the WHO guideline value. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that children attending early childhood centres located alongside busy roads have greater exposure to traffic-related PM10 pollution than those attending early childhood centres located away from a quiet road or adjacent to a very quiet road. If the link between PM10 exposure and health effects is causal, as suggested by epidemiological studies, then children attending early childhood centres proximal to busy roads are at a greater risk of respiratory illness than children attending early childhood centres adjacent to quiet roads.  Further work is required to confirm the findings in this small sample of air quality around early childhood centres in a larger sample, and possibly to undertake an epidemiological study to confirm the link to health effects. Drawing on the precautionary principle, prudent territorial local authorities should be encouraged to introduce regulations ensuring that any new early childhood centres are located at a specified distance from major roads, and that information for parents, ongoing PM10 monitoring and processes for issuing PM10 advisories when limits are exceeded are available in existing early childhood centres that are adjacent to busy roads.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Particulates</field><field name="subject">Respiratory disease</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Traffic</field><field name="subject">Early childhood centres</field><field name="subject">Pilot study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploratory study aimed to determine the efficacy of an assessment battery designed to examine oral English language acquisition in refugee and migrant children.</field><field name="creator">Hurburun, Anita L Jibodh</field><field name="description">The process of migration has resulted in population growth and contributed to the transformation of New Zealand. Migrant and refugee children face many adjustment factors and their ease in resettling in New Zealand is largely dependent on their ability to learn English. Migration stress, change, trauma and loss may result in psychological difficulties which in turn may affect their resettling and learning.  The Ministry of Education and other professionals work together to enhance the quality of their service provision to facilitate easier adjustment, resettlement and effective learning for these children. An adequate assessment battery for speech language therapists to assess migrant and refugee children, is presently lacking in New Zealand. Therapists currently use various assessments, with the assistance of interpreters. The New Zealand Speech Therapists&#8217; Association (NZSTA), in accordance with speech therapists in Group Special Education (GSE), strongly supports the need for research with these groups and the development of an appropriate assessment battery. This exploratory study aimed to determine an assessment battery for use in examining English language acquisition in refugee and migrant children and to highlight the benefit of using measurement tools that determine incremental change over time in contrast to the use of monolingual psychometric tests. The study explored a selected assessment battery and gathered data in five main focus areas, namely: cognition, language, trauma, classroom behaviour, developmental and birth information. Eligible children were those who did not have physiologically - impaired cognitive abilities. Eight cases, four refugee and four migrant students, were selected by convenience sampling. All participants were children selected from primary school 1 (three refugees and three migrants) and primary school 2 (one refugee and one migrant) primary schools, aged approximately (5-8 years). Participants included four male and four females, refugee and migrant children, and those with both high and low English ability. Based on the study&#8217;s results, recommendations were made to refine the test battery, which included test modification. For example, the use of the trauma measurement tool only if there is prior evidence of trauma, the inclusion of a larger test population who have a common primary language to allow for cost effective interpreter use and to also allow for generalisations to be made, the inclusion of an assessment of the children&#8217;s primary language in order to determine the relationship, development and acquisition of the child&#8217;s second language with reference to his/her development and skills in his native language. All of the refugee children and 3 migrant children displayed slower processing time during the administration of the tests. Migrant parents were quicker in test completion as compared to refugee parents. They displayed differences in family size, contact with extended family, socioeconomic status and educational level. Migrant children produced sentences that included correct word order and sequence whilst refugee children produced sentences that lacked adequate word order or lacked articles and determiners. The study found the proposed test battery was an effective choice for use in the assessment of both migrant and refugee children, as the battery allows for dynamic assessment of children from diverse groups and this proved to be an unbiased means of assessing their English language and cognitive skills. Recommendations are made for future, more-extensive research. These findings provide information about appropriate and reliable language acquisition tests that measure incremental change with time. This study will contribute to a developing knowledge base for speech-language therapists who work with migrant or refugee children. Effective assessment on which to base tailored language programmes will assist them to optimise their experience in New Zealand schools and enhance their English language skills.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oral language</field><field name="subject">English language acquisition</field><field name="subject">Refugee and migrant children</field><field name="subject">Language acquisition assessment and tests</field><field name="subject">Speech Language therapists</field><field name="subject">English as a second language ESOL</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A field study of domain knowledge sharing in the software development industry in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ekadharmawan, Christian Harsana</field><field name="description">In contemporary software development, an emergent understanding of the problem domain and envisioned goals forms the basis of designing, testing and development activities. Lack of a common understanding of the domain can result in costly rework or client dissatisfaction. Research shows that the development of shared understanding in this context is a complex and error-prone process and there is room for improvement. Is this because practitioners are not following suggested practice from literature? Or are the actual barriers to shared understanding not being addressed by current tools and techniques? Is the development of shared domain understanding even viewed as problematic (or even important) by practitioners? These are some questions that need to be investigated in order to effectively design process improvements and tool support in this area, yet there is little information related to this. This study takes a multi-case study approach, which incorporate semi-structured interviews with representative from ten small-to-medium organisations. This study focuses on the vendor&#8217;s perspective and includes a mix of application domains. Result of the interviews is analysed to discover themes and patterns related to an analysis framework constructed from the literature review. The findings indicate that vendors perceive the process of developing shared application-domain understanding with their clients as being both problematic and important to a successful implementation. Twelve barriers have been identified from the analysis. The results also confirm that the process of sharing understanding development is generally perceived as being evolutionary and collaborative. This process is described by most interviewees comprises iterative phases of elicitation, confirmation and refinement of the understanding. A definite preference for face-to-face interaction is evident at regular times throughout development, particularly in early stages, although the importance of ad-hoc communications by phone or email, as domain knowledge needs arise, is also emphasised. Access to cooperative domain-expert throughout development is generally seen as a critical success factor. Several companies report using in-house domain-expert as client &#8220;proxies&#8221; in this regard. There is a mix of attitudes apparent regarding the direct communications of developers with client stakeholders. This ranged from insisting that developers are involved from initial elicitation and &#8220;kick-off&#8221; meetings, to &#8220;shielding&#8221; developers almost entirely from client. In terms of representations of understanding, participants relate natural-language, screen-shots, mock-ups, prototypes and product-demonstrations as the most useful artefacts for sharing and confirming understanding of the problem domain. They emphasise the importance of flexibility and client familiarity with the representations. In general, there is no clear separation between problem and solution spaces evident when the interviewees discussed representations of understanding, and the preference seems to be for concrete rather than abstract representations. In conclusion, comparisons between the findings and literature generally confirm contemporary thinking regarding domain knowledge sharing, although a number of barriers were given particular emphasis in this field study. The use of computer-based tool support is not widespread and the need to improve the domain knowledge sharing process and tool support in practice is widely acknowledged by the participants in this investigation. This study has identified some fruitful areas of research in this regard.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="subject">Multiple case study</field><field name="subject">Field study</field><field name="subject">Requirement engineering</field><field name="subject">Domain knowledge</field><field name="subject">Problem domain</field><field name="subject">Shared understanding</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimating bioaccessibility, phytoavailability and phytotoxicity of contaminant arsenic in soils at former sheep dip sites</field><field name="creator">Mojsilovic, Ognjen</field><field name="description">Recognition that the bioavailability of soil As (As) is influenced by its soil dynamics has initiated research into development of more accurate, site-specific soil guideline values, departing from the assumption that the total soil As content is bioavailable. With the aim of deriving predictive models, the relationship between soil properties and As bioavailability (bioaccessibility and phytotoxicity) was examined on a set of naturally contaminated sheep dip soils (n = 30). Sampled soils were extensively characterised, bioaccessibility was estimated through an in vitro procedure, and soil As toxicity and availability to plants were evaluated using an early growth wheat bioassay. The in vitro bioaccessibility was consistently less than the total soil As content. Arsenic bioaccessibility was negatively correlated to soil iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and aluminium (Al) contents, and it was positively related to the soil As loading. The in vitro extractable soil As concentrations were successfully modelled using linear combinations of soil As content, soil Fe and Mn determinations and soil pH. Differences in As phytotoxicity, expressed in terms of effective toxic concentration (EC50), between soils were directly related to soil Fe, Mn and Al contents. Available soil phosphorous (P) exerted an ameliorating effect on As toxicity, with the available soil As/P ratio representing the single best predictor of plant growth suppression. Plant P nutrition appeared to influence the relative selectivity for As and P by wheat, with greater selectivity for P demonstrated under P deficient conditions. Plant As uptake, its distribution, and also the plant nutrient status were all adversely affected by increasing soil As exposure. Co-contamination by Zn corresponded to a substantial elevation in proportion of the plant As allocated in shoots. Plant As levels exhibited a saturation-dependent relationship with increasing soil As. The best linear predictors of plant As levels in the non-toxic range were RHIZO-extractable and effective soil As concentrations, the latter based on the diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique. Despite the complexity of soil As dynamics, large proportions in the variances exhibited by the two measures of bioavailability were explained using a small set of readily-available soil properties.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">as bioavailability</field><field name="subject">as bioaccessibility</field><field name="subject">as phytotoxicity</field><field name="subject">as availability indices</field><field name="subject">diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT)</field><field name="subject">sheep dips</field><field name="subject">wheat</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The large decline in output volatility: evidence from China</field><field name="creator">Wang, Shi Zhao</field><field name="description">Since the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China in 1949, China has experienced ten business cyclical fluctuations. The economic growth was characterized by erratic ups and downs which lasted for several decades. With the economic reform and opening up to the outside world in 1978 as part of Deng Xiaoping&#8217;s market-oriented policy, the Chinese economy grew exponentially and the volatility of the GDP growth rate declined significantly. The macroeconomic control policies in the 1980s prevented large fluctuations in the country&#8217;s economic development, and smoothed the output volatility further. This study examines the output volatility in China and our result reveals the standard deviation of quarterly output growth rate has declined dramatically. Using the CUSUM squares test and the Quandt-Andrews breakpoint test to identify unknown structure breaks, we identified two structural breaks: 1994:1 towards destabilization and 1998:1 towards stabilization. We then examine the stochastic process for GDP and the result shows that the decrease in volatility can be traced primarily to a decrease in the standard deviation of output shocks. Following this, we reached two other conclusions. First, there is a strong relationship between movements in output volatility and the movements in inflation volatility. Both output and inflation volatilities increased significantly during the third and fourth quarter of 1994 and both dropped sharply after 1996, which followed a similar path over the period. Second, using the standard decomposition of GDP, the decrease in output volatility can be traced to a decrease in the volatility of consumption, investment, and net export, especially rural consumption expenditure and residential investment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">output volatility</field><field name="subject">structural break</field><field name="subject">output process</field><field name="subject">inflation volatility</field><field name="subject">GDP components</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geometry-based stochastic physical channel modeling for cellular environments</field><field name="creator">Simsim, Mohammed Talal, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Telecommunication has experienced significant changes over the past few years and its paradigm has moved from wired to wireless communications. The wireless channel constitutes the basic physical link between the transmitter and the receiver antennas. Therefore, complete knowledge of the wireless channel and radio propagation environment is necessary in order to design efficient wireless communication systems. This PhD thesis is devoted to studying the spatial and temporal statistics of the wireless channel in cellular environments based on a geometry-based stochastic physical channel modeling approach. Contributions in this thesis report include the following: ??? A new physical channel model called the eccentro-scattering model is proposed to study the spatial and temporal statistics of the multipath signals in cellular environments. ??? Generic closed-form formulas for the probability density function (pdf) of angle of arrival (AoA) and time of arrival (ToA) of the multipath signals in each cellular environment are derived. These formulas can be helpful for the design and evaluation of modern communication systems. ??? A new Gaussian scattering model is proposed, which consists of two Gaussian functions for the distribution of scatterers around base station (BS) and mobile station (MS) and confines these scatterers within a scattering disc. ??? The effect of mobile motion on the spatial and temporal statistics of the multipath signals in cellular environments is discussed. Three motion scenarios are considered for the possible trajectory of the mobile unit. Furthermore, two different cases are identified when the terrain and clutter of mobile surrounding have additional effect on the temporal spread of the multipath signals during motion. ??? The physical channel model is employed to assess the performance of a RAKE receiver in cellular environments. ??? Comparisons between uniform scattering and Gaussian scattering, which are the two assumptions for the distribution of scatterers usually used in the derivation of the pdf of AoA, are also presented. ??? An overview of earlier physical channel models and comparisons between these models and with the proposed model are presented.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Cellular telephone systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological adaptation to nutrient limitation in a marine oligotrophic ultramicrobacterium Sphingopyxis alaskensis</field><field name="creator">Ostrowski, Martin, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sphingopyxis (formerly Sphingomonas) alaskensis, a numerically abundant species isolated from Alaskan waters and the North Sea represents one of the only pure cultures of a typical oligotrophic ultramicrobacterium isolated from the marine environment. In this study, physiological and molecular characterization of an extinction dilution isolate from the North Pacific indicate that it is a strain of Sphingopyxis alaskenis, extending the known geographical distribution of this strain and affirming its importance as a model marine oligotroph. Given the importance of open ocean systems in climatic processes, it is clearly important to understand the physiology and underlying molecular biology of abundant species, such as S. alaskensis, and to define their role in biogeochemical processes. S. alaskensis is thought to proliferate by growing slowly on limited concentrations of substrates thereby avoiding outright starvation. In order to mimic environmental conditions chemostat culture was used to study the physiology of this model oligotroph in response to slow growth and nutrient limitation. It was found that the extent of nutrient limitation and starvation has fundamentally different consequences for the physiology of oligotrophic ultramicrobacteria compared with well-studied copiotrophic bacteria (Vibrio angustum S14 and Escherichia coli). For example, growth rate played a critical role in hydrogen peroxide resistance of S. alaskensis with slowly growing cells being 10, 000 times more resistant than fast growing cells. In contrast, the responses of V. angustum and E. coli to nutrient availability differed in that starved cells were more resistant than growing cells, regardless of growth rate. In order to examine molecular basis of the response to general nutrient limitation, starvation and oxidative stress in S. alaskensis we used proteomics to define differences in protein profiles of chemostat-grown cultures at various levels of nutrient limitation. High-resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) methods were developed and 2DE protein maps were used to define proteins regulated by the level of nutrient limitation. A number of these proteins were identified with the aid of mass spectrometry and cross-species database matching. The identified proteins are involved in fundamental cellular processes including protein synthesis, protein folding, energy generation and electron transport, providing an important step in discovering the molecular basis of oligotrophy in this model organism.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine bacteria -- Growth</field><field name="subject">Biogeochemical cycles</field><field name="subject">Marine microbiology</field><field name="subject">Molecular biology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mutant manifesto: a response to the symbolic positions of evolution and genetic engineering within self perception.</field><field name="creator">Cooper, Simon George, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Believing that ideas about evolution and genetics are playing an increasing role in popular conceptions of who we are and what it means to be human, I sought ways to express this through my art. In particular I tried to articulate these notions through figurative sculpture. As the role of figurative sculpture in expressing current ideas about being human has declined in the West, I saw this as a challenge. It was the intent of my Masters program to reposition the sculpted body back within contemporary western cultural contexts. For an understanding of those contexts I relied heavily on my own culturally embedded experience and observations. I took as background my readings of evolutionary inspired literature and linked it with my interpretations of the genetic mythologies so prevalent in recent movies. The result was an image of contemporary humans as multifaceted, yet subservient to their genes. These genes appear to be easily manipulated and the product of technological intervention as much as, if not more than, inherited characteristics.  As part of developing a sculptural form able to manifest this, I investigated some non-western traditions. I used field trips and residencies to research Buddhist and Hindu sculptures of the body and developed an interest in the spatial and conceptual relationships between those bodies.  Through making figurative work in the studio, I came to realise the figures' inadequacy in expressing temporal relationships. As temporal change is a fundamental element of evolution and genetics, I needed to explore this element.  The result was a number of series; groups of works that create their own context of relationships. Not all these groups use sculptures of the body but they evoke the notion of bodies, naturally or technologically hybridised, mutating, transforming, evolving and related to each other generationaly through time.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetic engineering in art.</field><field name="subject">Figure sculpture.</field><field name="subject">Body image in art.</field><field name="subject">Human figure in art.</field><field name="subject">Animals, Mythical.</field><field name="subject">Art and society.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between evidence and policy: a tracer study of promoting health equity through early childhood intervention in Australia</field><field name="creator">Bowen, Shelley, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes what counts as evidence and what constitutes an evidence-informed approach to health policy development, particularly policy with an equity focus. While health policy is increasingly aiming to be ???evidence-based???, a narrow conceptualisation of this can neglect the importance of the powerful and dynamic context of public policy-making. An evidence-informed approach recognises and works with a broader range of contextual influences. The aim of this thesis was to extend and deepen understanding of how evidence informs policy that promotes health equity, through a tracer study of policy development in Australia. The objectives of the research were to examine influential types of evidence, their role and function; to investigate the context, processes and relationships that contributed to evidence informed health policy, and to gain a deeper understanding of how health equity, and evidence on equity, was conceptualised and considered in the policy process. Two Australian state government policy initiatives in the area of early childhood intervention were investigated through interviews with key policy actors in both states, and media, political and policy documentary analyses. A theory-informed framework was developed from the literature to guide this research. This thesis has led to the development of a number of theoretical models, insights and working principles to guide evidence-informed policy development. The models emerge from a conceptual framework that describes how clusters of information (contextual, expert opinion, scientific studies, policy audit, and economic) combine with a number of policy conditions (necessity, opportunity, capacity, relationships, actors and processes) to become a ???case for policy???. What follows seems to be several primary insights to the types of evidence that inform health policy; the identification of an ???adopt, adapt, apply??? phase in policy-making; and the existence of an ???equity policy gap??? ??? exposing the rare translation of equity principles into policy action. Findings from this study call for recognition of research as only one information source in policy development. The successful integration of research and policy is more likely if research evidence is seen within, and as a part of, a more complex policy development system.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health Policy -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29467</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heroics of the false: a new look at noir.</field><field name="creator">Breukelaar, Jennifer S, English, Media &amp; Performance, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis I investigate the nature of noir subjectivity, and the degree to which it can be described as heroic. To investigate these issues, I have chosen to illustrate my argument by analysing my novel, Viper, and two films that renew the noir cycle at different socio-political crossroads in America: in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock???s late noir, Vertigo, and in 1974, Frances Ford Coppola???s neo-noir, The Conversation. Because these texts present an extreme theorisation of deception in terms of the assembling and erasure of subjective identity, they will serve as a basis to explore the question of noir subjectivity. In proceeding thus, I argue in the dissertation that film noir???s most innovative borrowing can be described as a monstrous stitching together of incompatible parts???the real and the imaginary, the past and the present, the living and the dead???which accounts for a cut both between, and within, the image. It is this prosthetic approach to representation that takes the noir mode beyond its existential, individualist limits, and accounts for the subjective wound in noir: the heroic conflict between the singular and the multiple. In my analytic procedure then, I extend the idea of monstrosity beyond its current boundaries in contemporary theory. I do this by fusing Marie H??l??ne Huet???s conception of the monstrous imagination, which is a theory of art, with Gilles Deleuze???s powers of the false, which belongs to a philosophy of time. I posit a dialogic exchange across these analyses and my novel to suggest that the cinematic cut not only accounts for what Deleuze has termed the time-image but also is symptomatic of the chronic wounding of the riven noir hero. These analyses suggest that, while sustaining the aura of authorship through technical innovation and stylistic mastery, film noir serves paradoxically to challenge the mastery of the model designated as masculine. In my novel I continue to deal with the issues raised in the dissertation, through a rearticulation of a subjectivity that irrevocably alters its relation to representation in its affinity with the image, its serial movement through interstitial space, and its novel powers of falsification.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hitchcock, Alfred, 1899-1980.</field><field name="subject">Coppola, Francis Ford, 1939- -- Criticism and interpretation.</field><field name="subject">Representation (Philosophy)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The agony of human rights a discussion and eveluation of the illusive consensus.</field><field name="creator">Bassin, Genevieve, School of Politics &amp; International Relations, UNSW</field><field name="description">How can a normative consensus on human rights develop out of a plurality of different and conflicting ethico-cultural discourses? It is frequently assumed that any agreement on universal human rights must necessarily occur in spite of pluralism from which conflict might arise. Consequently, various images of consensus have been proposed wherein pluralism is viewed as something to be mitigated or overcome. However, such images of consensus fail to offer a satisfactory response to the original question since they fail to fully recognise the political and contestational nature of human rights discourse. This thesis aims to address questions as to how conflict and contingency, both commonly associated with pluralism, can be mediated in a way that is constructive of a particular political community, and constitutive of a vital and innovative discourse on human rights. Hence, theories on agonistic pluralism are discussed and evaluated since they address this very issue ??? the potential for struggle to act as a constructive force. Also in this thesis, a historical analysis of key milestones in the development of a human rights discourse is presented wherein it is argued that human rights have indeed been contingent upon particular instances of struggle and have found expression in a plurality of distinct  ethico-cultural discourses. Finally, in order to further illustrate the adaptability of human rights to more than one ethical discourse, examples are presented in which various Muslim scholar-activists justify human rights norms according to Islamic doctrinal principles. Overall, it is the argument of this thesis that it is possible to imagine a human rights consensus, not as a ???world consensus???, but in terms of a sectional political association whose membership is culturally pluralist. In saying this, it must be acknowledged that this construction is necessarily always precarious, precisely because of the contestational, contingent and transformative nature of the discourse of human rights. Also, although only sectional in terms of its support base, the ???consensus??? I describe necessarily strives to become a universal consensus. While universal respect for human rights is ultimately illusive, in view of the universalism of human rights as a discourse, to strive for anything less is unacceptable. In the end, the constant struggle to establish a universal consensus on human rights is precisely that which effects positive, practical change.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Consensus (Social sciences)</field><field name="subject">Human rights.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social reconstruction learning: Using philosophy for children &amp; John Dewey to overcome problematic dualisms in education and philosophy.</field><field name="creator">Bleazby, Jennifer, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Many of the problems in dominant Western education and philosophy can be connected to various dualisms, in particular reason/emotion, reason/imagination, reason/experience, mind/body, subject/object, individual/community, abstract/concrete, theory/practice and male/female dualisms. These pairs are considered opposites, with the attributes on the left supposedly superior to their dualistic partners on the right. While those attributes on the left, such as mind and reason, are traditionally associated with knowledge, autonomy, citizenship and learning, the attributes on the right, such as emotion and experience, are traditionally thought to be opposed to knowledge, autonomy, citizenship and learning. Drawing on the philosophies of John Dewey and various feminist philosophers, I will argue that the attributes that make up each of these dualistic pairs are not opposed but are actually interdependent and interconnected. For example, I will argue that all thinking and learning involves reason, experience, emotion and imagination interacting with one and other. Neither of these attributes or functions is complete or fully functional without the others. Since mainstream Western pedagogies incorporate such dualisms they are unable to fully facilitate the thinking skills, attributes, dispositions and understandings necessary for autonomy, democratic citizenship and leading a meaningful life. It will be shown that Philosophy for Children (P4C) has the potential to overcome many of the problems with mainstream education, including many gender equity problems, because it is based on Dewey???s philosophical ideals, which reconstruct many of these dualisms. An analysis of the ideals of truth, meaning, community, self, autonomy, democracy, thinking, emotion and imagination assumed by P4C will show how it reconstructs various dualisms and overcomes many problems with traditional schooling. However, it will also be shown that P4C fails to reconstruct the undesirable theory/practice dualism because it doesn???t require students to test and apply their ideas in the real world. This is even though many P4C theorists, such as Matthew Lipman, accept Dewey???s claim that all thinking and learning involve such practicality. Thus, I will reconstruct the P4C pedagogy by integrating it with a Deweyian type of service learning that I call social reconstruction learning. Social reconstruction learning involves students engaging in P4C style communities of inquiry with members of their community in order to reconstruct real social problems. Such a Practical P4C pedagogy can better facilitate reflective thinking, autonomy, active citizenship and meaningfulness.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dewey, John, 1859-1952 -- Democracy and education.</field><field name="subject">Dualism.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge???s value: internalism and externalism.</field><field name="creator">Balderson, Shannon, School of Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis engages with epistemology???s value problem. That is, is knowledge epistemically preferable to true belief? If so, how is that the case? The issue under discussion is whether epistemic justification can account for a value discrepancy between true belief and knowledge. First of all, the contours of the justificatory landscape are presented???in particular, the division between externalist and internalist styles. The thesis then considers whether solely truth-directed justification (which includes externalism) can possibly account for a value unique to knowledge. The preliminary conclusion is that solely truth-directed justification cannot solve the value problem. A discussion of internalism then ensues. The discussion does not focus explicitly on which benefits internalism may offer in terms of value; instead, the focus is on whether internalism qua internalism can solve the value problem. It is concluded that, if internalism is the sole provider of the value of knowledge (above that of true belief), then epistemology must forgo the belief that knowledge is preferable to a Gettiered belief. I do not accept such a concession; therefore, I reject the thesis that internalism exclusively solves the value problem. Throughout the thesis, the importance of externalism to epistemology becomes apparent. This feature invites a reconsideration of the value of externalism (in particular, of reliabilism). The thesis closes by reconsidering the value of reliabilism and concludes that the value problem can be solved, but only by an appeal to externalist justification.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge, Theory of.</field><field name="subject">Internalism (Theory of knowledge)</field><field name="subject">Justification (Theory of knowledge)</field><field name="subject">Externalism (Philosophy of mind)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In sickness and in health: identity-based and relational discourses of intimacy in the early 21st century</field><field name="creator">Borinski, Diana , Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">What ways of being and knowing constitute the experience of healthy relational life? Ontologically, what takes place in the experience of meeting a loved one, face to face? What is ???good communication??? in an intimate relationship? What does commitment enable in relational life, and what constitutes healthy dedication in marriages?  This thesis addresses the above questions through a conceptual analysis of the dual nature of social life: identity-based, self-reifying, object-focused, atomised and oppositional, and dialogical, relational and present. It does so with the help of qualitatively analysed interviews of respondents talking about their experiences of committed intimate relationships.  The first part of this thesis discovers that current social theory links the increased fragility of intimate relationships to the individualisation of social experience, and the rise of discourses that encourage reflexivity and personal responsibility. I discuss specific funding strategies the Australian Federal Government employs in seeking to manage the risk of marriage breakdown in the community. I argue that while a complex mix of rational-instrumental reasoning, the neo-liberal ethos of self-enterprise and some Christian norms of family life underlie much policy, the actual practice of marriage education in Australia has a community basis, and has much potential for real relationships. I offer a critique of risk-preventative discourses in marriage pedagogy, and show that the key terms used by clinical researchers draw on the same methodological individualism as the economic model of relational life. I argue that often, social theorists also reduce relationships to dyads of competing individuals exchanging themselves as goods, or bargaining for the best deal while using their investments as threat points. I suggest that the identity struggles that ensue from such alienated relations in intimate lives can be understood through the Hegelian binary oppositional model, and also, through some psychoanalytical theory on differentiation.  This thesis suggests that on examination of couples??? relationships, we find a different ontological structure in relationality. Relationships have the potential to transcend their total, additive, atomised form and be experienced as wholes. Couples teach us that love is not just self-directed action; that choice can burden, but responsibility to what is present can be freeing; and that relational ???success??? is more complex than simply staying together for life.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Family.</field><field name="subject">Marriage.</field><field name="subject">Couples.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/34945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Once daily gentamicin in infants and children: an evaluation of safety and the role of therapeutic drug monitoring in minimising toxicity</field><field name="creator">Best, Emma, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">AIMS: To assess (i) the safety of once daily dosing (ODD) of gentamicin by systematic evaluation of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity; and (ii) the usefulness of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in a paediatric cohort. METHOD: Infants and children with suspected or proven gram negative sepsis were enrolled prospectively to receive ODD gentamicin at 7 mg/kg/day. Neonates were excluded. Hearing and renal function were assessed at baseline, during and after therapy by otoacoustic emissions (OAE) and by either serum creatinine or glomerular filtration rate. Abnormal OAE were followed with audiometry. TDM was performed using an interval adjusted graphical method (Hartford nomogram) with levels taken between 6-14 hours after dose. Assessment of efficacy (clinical and microbiological) was a secondary outcome measure. RESULTS: There were 106 episodes of therapy in 79 children (median age 5.6 years; range 1 month - 16 years), 60% of which were for febrile neutropaenia. Evaluation was complete in 88% (93/106) for ototoxicity and 92% (98/106) for nephrotoxicity. Two children (1.88%, 95% CI 0.10 - 7.13) experienced permanent hearing loss. Three children did not complete full assessment after preliminary abnormalities on OAE. Incorporating these cases gives a ???worst case scenario??? incidence of 4.71% (95% CI 1.71 - 10.91) possible ototoxicity. One child (0.94%, 95% CI &lt; 0.10 - 5.73) experienced transient nephrotoxicity. No ???toxic??? serum gentamicin levels were detected, including in those children who experienced clinical toxicity. All children with detectable toxicity were undergoing treatment for malignancies and had received nephro or ototoxic medications prior to the gentamicin course. Complete or partial efficacy was seen in 93% (non oncology) and 78% (oncology) treatment episodes, equivalent to prior literature reports. CONCLUSION: In this systematically evaluated paediatric cohort receiving ODD gentamicin, toxicity occurred infrequently and only in those with identifiable risk factors. TDM did not identify children who developed clinical toxicity. The development of toxicity appears to be associated with factors such as underlying medical condition, prior courses of gentamicin, exposure to other oto or nephrotoxic medications, all of which may be more predictive of toxicity than elevated serum gentamicin levels. TDM in healthy children on short course gentamicin appears unnecessary, but may be warranted in conjunction with renal and hearing assessments in those with risk factors.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gentamicin.</field><field name="subject">Infants.</field><field name="subject">Children.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35192</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A spatial decision support system for the management of public housing</field><field name="creator">Barton, John Edward, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public housing -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Decision-making.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Superposition coding and modulation technique for wireless relay systems</field><field name="creator">Bui, Tuyen Thi Bich, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cooperative communication has been considered a promising technique used in wireless network to introduce diversity. Based on distributed architecture, cooperative network enables single-antenna users to share their information as a virtual multiple antenna array, which makes it possible to enhance the user data rates and obtain the diversity gain. Depending on the ways users share and process the information, practical user cooperation is mainly grouped in three modes: Amplify and Forward (AF), Decode and Forward (DF) and Compress and Forward (CF). Generally, DF outperforms AF in most practical implementation and is alternately the best by theoretical analysis. In particular, it is shown in theory that DF outperforms CF when the inter-user link is in good condition and vice versa.    Considered as a capacity achieving approach, superposition encoding technique produces approximate Gaussian output signals. It is the power and spectral efficiency of the encoding scheme that make it useful for several wireless communication systems such as MIMO system, relay channels, and so on. The main goal of the thesis is to study how much superposition coding can help when applied to DF user cooperation.   In particular, a new DF scheme with soft information relaying technique is proposed to overcome the performance degradation happening when the quality of the inter-user channel is bad. Based on the scheme, soft log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of the relay decoder is quantized, encoded, modulated by superimposition and then forwarded to the destination. The destination receiver employs an iterative superposition decoder and modified maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoder to recover the transmitted signal from the source. The performance of the scheme is evaluated by simulation. We show that the new scheme can significantly outperform the conventional DF scheme even in a poor inter-user channel.   Furthermore, a new cooperative transmission strategy based on superposition and multiuser detection techniques is also investigated in the thesis. The new scheme is an improved DF scheme in which the two users take turns in being the relay for each other and the signal forwarded by each user is the superimposed data of both users. Here, interleavers are introduced in the superposition process as an efficient user separation tool, providing a large improvement in error performance and also facilitating the decoding process at the destination. Different types of iterative receivers are examined. The performance of the scheme is evaluated by simulation. It is shown that the new transmission scheme outperforms the conventional one in terms of both spectral and power efficiency.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Superposition principle (Physics)</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/36827</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assurance reporting and the communication process: impacts on report users' perceptions and decision-making</field><field name="creator">Pflugrath, Gary, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the effectiveness of communication between assurors and assurance report users, and the role that assurance reports play in this process. It comprises two behavioural experiments undertaken in the context of: (i) wording changes to the audit report (developed product) using shareholders as participants; and (ii) the role of assurance and type of assurance provider for corporate social responsibility reporting (evolving product), using financial analysts as participants. In both studies effectiveness of communication is examined in terms of report users?? perceptions and investment decision-making. The theoretical framework used in these studies is adapted from a communications model developed by Shannon and Weaver (1949), and supplemented by psychology research focused on source credibility (Birnbaum and Stegner, 1979). Two key elements of the communication process are recognised; the: (i) message transmitted; and (ii) source of the message. The first element is considered in the first experiment; the second element in the second study. Useful feedback is provided to standard-setters. From the first study, report users?? perceptions are not impacted by changes to the wording of the audit report. However, in the second experiment they are affected by differences in the source of the message. In terms of trustworthiness, financial analysts perceive the credibility of the source of corporate social responsibility information to be significantly greater when assured. For a company in an industry with stronger incentives to report positive corporate social responsibility information, they perceive the credibility (trustworthiness, overall credibility) of the source of the information to be significantly greater when assured. They also discern differences between types of assuror whereby the credibility (trustworthiness, expertise, overall credibility) of the source of information is perceived to be greater when assured by a professional accountant than a sustainability expert. A contribution of these experiments is the analysis of report users?? investment decision-making, as well as their perceptions. Differences in the message and source of the message for assurance reporting have no impact on report users?? investment decisions. Differences in characteristics of report users (familiarity with reports, extent to which reports are understandable) appear to impact report users?? perceptions and merits further examination.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate Social Responsibility</field><field name="subject">Assurance Reporting</field><field name="subject">Communication</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Co-operation between the docking protein GAB2 and the protein tyrosine kinase src in human mammary epithelial cells</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Haley Lorraine, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Gab2 docking protein is a target of several oncogenic protein tyrosine kinases and potentiates activation of the Ras/extracellular signal regulated kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) pathways. The prototypical member of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases, c-Src, phosphorylates Gab2 and both proteins are overexpressed in breast cancers. However, whether overexpression of these two proteins contributes to mammary tumourigenesis had not been previously investigated. Pharmacological inhibition of c-Src in breast cancer cell lines reduced Gab2 tyrosine phosphorylation while overexpression of these two proteins increased this effect, demonstrating a contribution of c-Src to Gab2 tyrosine phosphorylation in breast cancer cells. The biological effects of Gab2 and c-Src overexpression were determined in a three-dimensional cell culture model using the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. When cultured on a basement membrane, MCF10A cells form acini that model mammary lobules in vivo. Overexpression of Gab2 in MCF10As conferred increased acinar size and independence of the morphogenetic program from exogenous EGF. While overexpression of c-Src alone did not affect acinar morphogenesis, it potentiated the EGF-independent acinar growth induced by Gab2 overexpression. As enhanced c-Src kinase activity is often observed in breast cancer, the effect of Gab2 co-expression with active Src constructs was next determined. Expression of v-Src or c-SrcY527F altered acinar morphology and the resulting structures were categorised as spheroidal, discohesive or dispersed, according to the degree of phenotypic disruption. Gab2 co-expression shifted the proportion of structures towards the dispersed phenotype. This shift reflects a negative role for Gab2 at adherens junctions in the context of active Src expression, as in monolayer cells Gab2 significantly decreased E-cadherin-based adhesive strength without altering the surface expression of this adhesion molecule. Furthermore, Gab2 associated with the E-cadherin complex. The ability of Gab2 to weaken the strength of cell-cell contacts in active Src-expressing cells may be due to enhanced activation of PI3-kinase signalling at adherens junctions, as the potentiating effects of Gab2 in both monolayer and three-dimensional cultures were dependent upon Gab2 recruitment of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase. Finally, Gab2 increased migration and invasion of v-Src-expressing cells in transwell assays, however these effects were p85-independent. This is the first study to demonstrate Gab2 co-operation with various forms of Src to augment proliferative, invasive and migratory signals, as well as revealing a novel mechanism whereby Gab2 may promote metastatic spread.  This study thus demonstrates multiple roles for Gab2 in contributing to breast cancer progression.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Protein-tyrosine kinase.</field><field name="subject">Epithelial cells.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topics in navigation and guidance of wheeled robots</field><field name="creator">Teimoori Sangani, Hamid, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Navigation and guidance of mobile robots towards steady or maneuvering objects (targets) is one of the most important areas of robotics that has attracted a lot of attention in recent decades. However, in most of the existing methods, both the line-of-sight angle (bearing) and the relative distance (range) are assumed to be available for navigation and guidance algorithms. There is also a relatively large body of research on navigation and guidance with bearings-only measurements. In contrast, only a few results on navigation and guidance towards an unknown target using range-only measurements have been published.  Various problems of navigation, guidance, location estimation and target tracking based on range-only measurements often arise in new wireless networks related applications. Recent advances in these applications allow us to use inexpensive transponders and receivers for range-only measurements which provide information in dynamic and noisy environments without the necessity of line-of-sight. To take advantage of these sensors, algorithms must be developed for range-only navigation.  The main part of this thesis is concerned with the problem of real-time navigation and guidance of Wheeled Mobile Robots (WMRs) towards an unknown stationary or moving target using range-only measurements. The range can be estimated using the signal strength and the robust extended Kalman filtering. Several similar algorithms for navigation and guidance termed Equiangular Navigation and Guidance (ENG) laws are proposed and mathematically rigorous proofs of convergence and stability of the proposed guidance laws are given. The experimental investigation into the use of range data for a WMR navigation is documented and the results and discussions on the performance of the proposed guidance strategies are presented, where a wheeled robot successfully approach a stationary or follow a maneuvering target.  In order to safely navigate and reliably operate in populated environments, ENG is then modified into Augmented-ENG (AENG), which enables the robot to approach a stationary target or follow an unpredictable maneuvering object in an unknown environment, while keeping a safe distance from the target, and simultaneously preserving a safety margin from the obstacles. Furthermore, we propose and experimentally investigate a new biologically inspired method for local obstacle avoidance and give the mathematically rigorous proof of the idea. In order for the robot to avoid collision and bypass the enroute obstacles in this method, the angle between the instantaneous moving direction of the robot and a reference point on the surface of the obstacle is kept constant. The proposed idea is combined with the ENG law, which leads to a reliable and fast long-range navigation. The performance of both navigation strategy and local obstacle avoidance techniques are confirmed with computer simulations and several experiments with ActivMedia Pioneer 3-DX wheeled robots.  The second part of the thesis investigates some challenging problems in the area of wheeled robot navigation. We first address the problem of bearing-only guidance of an autonomous vehicle following a moving target with smaller minimum turning radius compared to that of the follower and propose a simple and constructive navigation law. In compliance with the increasing research on decentralized control laws for groups of mobile autonomous robots, we consider the problems of decentralized navigation of network of WMRs with limited communication and decentralized stabilization of formation of WMRs. New control laws are presented and simulation results are provided to illustrate the control laws and their applications.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Obstacle avoidance.</field><field name="subject">Wheeled mobile robot.</field><field name="subject">Navigation.</field><field name="subject">Formation Control.</field><field name="subject">UAV.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Respect, toleration and diversity: protecting individual freedom in liberal societies</field><field name="creator">Balint, Peter Arthur, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">In diverse societies like Australia, Britain, Canada and The Netherlands, government policy has increasingly focused on inter-citizen relations. There have been demands for citizens to respect each others?? differences, as well as fears about declining social cohesion and acts of intolerance. In political theory, these themes also have currency, although here they often have been obscured by a tendency to think in terms of ??majorities?? and minorities??, and ??we?? and ??they??, rather than in terms of the state and the individual citizen. This thesis argues that while respect of difference may seem to be the best way to successfully accommodate individual difference, it is an indefensible demand on the citizen: such a demand is both excessive and unnecessary, and has the potential to unjustifiably limit individual freedom and the accommodation of difference. Further, the requirement for social cohesion is often overstated, while acts of intolerance are best avoided by citizens respecting each others?? sameness (citizenship) rather than their difference. As far as the state is concerned, by clearly distinguishing specific instances of tolerance (which always involve forbearance) from the general practice of toleration, the thesis defends toleration as a general and maximally permissive practice ?? one which is compatible with both liberal neutrality and the maximal accommodation of individual difference, and thus the freedom of individuals to live their lives as they see fit.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">Respect</field><field name="subject">Toleration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Compensatory strategies in humans performing active and passive gaze fixation and re-fixation tasks after unilateral vestibular deafferentation</field><field name="creator">Black, Ross Arthur, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The human vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) stabilizes gaze during head movement. The reflex is typically tested in a clinic or laboratory using passive rotations or artificial stimuli which measure the amount of damage the vestibular apparatus has suffered. However, during everyday activities the vestibular system is stimulated by active, self generated head movements. Head movements are often rapid and associated with the goal of achieving either gaze-fixation or re-fixation. Patients who complain of on-going symptoms will typically identify a particular position or movement that aggravates their symptoms in their everyday life. There is a need to identify objective parameters which correlate with the subjective complaints of patients whose symptoms persist after vestibular damage. In the first study, a gaze-refixation task, patients who complain of ongoing symptoms (poorly-compensated), during rapid head turns, after unilateral vestibular de-afferentation (uVD) were compared with those who did not have the same complaints (well-compensated) and normal subjects. Well- and poorly-compensated groups were sorted according to responses on a standardized questionnaire. All subjects were then located in a real-world, non-laboratory environment in which poorly-compensated subjects reported experiencing symptoms. Each subject&#146;s head, eye and gaze displacement and velocity, head rotation frequency and blink or eye-lid closure were measured and analysed and compared between ipsi- and contra-lesional head rotations within and between subject groups.  When subjects are able to generate their own active head rotations it has been suggested that a number of vestibular and extra-vestibular strategies might be employed to compensate for an impaired VOR. In subsequent studies, high resolution scleral search coils were used to identify the compensatory mechanisms used during active head rotations during a gaze-fixation task. A corrective saccade is typically observed during passive ipsilesional head rotations or &#147;impulses&#148; and might be potentiated during rapid, active or self-generated head rotations. The conditions which predict or contribute to the generation of the rapid, corrective eye movement were investigated. The results were compared with responses to passive head impulses of matched velocity and acceleration to determine if active head impulses could be used to identify a lesioned vestibular apparatus as is routinely clinically achieved with passive head impulses.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vestibulo-ocular reflex</field><field name="subject">human</field><field name="subject">vestibular compensation</field><field name="subject">head impulse</field><field name="subject">active passive</field><field name="subject">saccade</field><field name="subject">natural head movement</field><field name="subject">unilateral</field><field name="subject">gaze</field><field name="subject">activity of daily living</field><field name="subject">objective subjective</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple-response sequences in adult Korean TESOL classrooms</field><field name="creator">Ko, Sungbae, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, multiple-response sequences (MRSs) are examined. These are a language classroom practice in which two or more students respond to a teacher???s question or other elicitation. The study uses tools of Conversation Analysis to investigate over 38 hours of classroom talk- in-interaction in TESOL classes comprising monolingual adult Korean learners. Classes were recorded on audio and video in Seoul, South Korea and Sydney, Australia. About 1050 cases of MRSs were found and analysed. In the study, four distinct major types of multiple responses (MRs) are identified. These are: the identical MR, in which two or more students provide the same response; the complementary MR, in which two or more students??? responses provide essent ially the same meaning, but in different forms; the collaborative MR, in which two or more students collectively provide various parts of the response in the construction of a single response; and the competitive MR, in which two or more students provide responses that diverge from one another. The study also examines complex MRs, which are combinations of the basic four types, and expanded sequences, in which MRs occur in preparatory stage or post-expansion sequences. It was found that the teacher and students can produce highly complex, co-ordinated and orderly talk in the course of MRSs. The study also considers MRSs as a potential locus for second language learning. The relevance of this study to some major theories of second language acquisition is discussed, in particular in relation to social interaction in the classroom.Finally, some suggestions for future research in the area are presented.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of compostion of denture base polymers on impact resistance</field><field name="creator">Price, Carole Ann</field><field name="description">Master of Dental Surgery</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polymers in dentistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4775</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of sediment nutrient dynamics on the response of lake ecosystems to restoration and climate change</field><field name="creator">Trolle, Dennis</field><field name="description">Human activities such as urban settlement, farming, forestry and recreation, have caused deterioration of water quality in many freshwater lakes worldwide. Apart from anthropogenic impacts, it is also recognized that climate has a direct influence on lake water temperature, nutrient loads, phytoplankton abundance and chemistry. However, little is known about the potential effects of future climate change on lake water quality. Understanding the dynamics, abundance and availability of nutrient pools in lake bottom sediments is fundamentally important for predicting how, and over what time-scales, lake ecosystems will respond to future scenarios such as climate change, in-lake restoration or altered external nutrient loading. Through a sediment field study on 14 different lakes, and applications of complex lake ecosystem models to three New Zealand lakes, this study examined the spatial and temporal dynamics of sediment nutrient concentrations, and made considerations of the effects of restoration measures and future climate change on lake water quality.  To gain insight into processes influencing the dynamics of horizontal and vertical gradients of sediment nutrient concentrations, intact sediment cores were collected from twelve lakes within the Bay of Plenty province, North Island of New Zealand. In addition, intact sediment cores were collected from shallow Lake Te Waihora (Ellesmere) in the Canterbury province, South Island of New Zealand and shallow Lake Taihu in the Jaingsu province, China. The observed vertical concentration profiles of total phosphorus (TP) in the sediments revealed that the shape of these profiles can be similar across gradients of widely differing trophic status. Empirical and mechanistic steady state profile models were derived to describe the vertical distribution of total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN) and TP concentrations in the sediments. These models revealed that density-driven burial and biodiffusive mixing, which in the models also includes effects of redox-driven gradients, are strongly correlated with vertical gradients of sediment TC, TN and TP content, whereas lake trophic status was not.  Despite enhancing knowledge of the processes influencing vertical gradients of sediment nutrient concentrations, little is known about the rates at which sediment nutrient concentrations may change as a response to changes in external loading or climate. Studies into the composition of bottom sediments have been undertaken intermittently over the past three decades for the 12 lakes in the Bay of Plenty. These studies, together with the data collected in this study, were used to quantify temporal changes in sediment chemistry across the lakes. Comparison of the data collected in this study with results from a survey in 1995 showed that surficial sediment (0-2 cm) TP concentrations have increased in three of the 12 lakes, at rates ranging from 27.5 to 114.4 mg P kg-1 dry wt yr-1. TN concentrations in surficial sediments have increased in nine of the 12 lakes at rates ranging from 51.8 to 869.2 mg N kg-1 dry wt yr-1. A correlation analysis revealed that temporal changes in sediment TP and TN concentrations were not significantly linearly related (pgt0.05) to catchment area or temporal changes of different water column indices considered to reflect lake trophic state, including annual mean water column concentrations of TP, TN or chlorophyll a (Chl a).  While vertical profiles of sediment nutrient concentrations can be used to provide information about historical changes of trophic status in lakes, little is known about horizontal variability of sediment nutrient concentrations, including possibly relationships with horizontal variations in water column variables. In the large, shallow and eutrophic Lake Taihu, China, there are distinct horizontal water column concentration gradients of nutrients and Chl a. Concentrations are generally high in the north, where some of the major polluted tributaries enter the lake, and relatively low in the south, where macrophytes generally are abundant. To test whether these water column concentration gradients are similarly reflected in spatial heterogeneity of nutrient concentrations within the bottom sediments of Lake Taihu, I examined correlations between concentrations of TP and TN in surficial sediments (0-2 cm) and TP, TN and Chl a concentrations in water column samples determined for 32 sites in 2005. Linear correlation analysis revealed that surficial sediment TP concentrations across the 32 stations were related significantly, though weakly, to annual mean water column concentrations of TP and TN as well as Chl a. Correlations of surficial sediment TN with water column variables were, however, not significant (p gt 0.05). To better understand the effects of future climate change on lakes of different trophic status, I applied the one-dimensional lake ecosystem model, DYRESM-CAEDYM, to oligo-mesotrophic Lake Okareka, eutrophic Lake Rotoehu and highly eutrophic Lake Te Waihora. All three models were calibrated based on a three-year period (July 2002 - June 2005) and validated on a separate two-year period (July 2005 - June 2007). The model simulations generally showed good agreement with observed data for temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and total nutrient and Chl a concentrations. To represent a possible future climate of 2100, temperature predictions were derived from the regional climate model, DARLAM, based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A2 scenario, which suggests that air temperatures by the year 2100 will increase by an average of 2.5 'C and 2.7 'C for the Bay of Plenty and the Canterbury province, respectively, relative to the base scenario (years 2002-2007). Model simulations of the future climate scenarios indicate that climatic changes generally will lead to a degradation of lake water quality in all three lakes, especially during summer months, and further suggest that the effects on annual mean surface concentrations of TP, TN and Chl a will be equivalent to an increase in external TN and TP loading by 25-50%. Simulations for Lake Rotoehu, where diatoms and cyanophytes were represented in the conceptual model, further suggest that cyanophytes will be more abundant in the future, increasing by gt15% in annual mean biomass. Although the effects of climate change may be delayed or slightly mediated by the chemical resilience of the sediment nutrient pools, the effects of climate change on lake water quality in the New Zealand lakes will be of a magnitude that should be considered as management strategies are planned and implemented, thus increasing the probability of successful preservation or improvement in water quality in future decades.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sediment</field><field name="subject">diagenesis</field><field name="subject">ecosystem modelling</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Globalization of English: Its Impact on English Language Education in the Tertiary Education Sector in Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Her, Jia-Huey</field><field name="description">The overall agenda for the research reported here grew out of semi-structured interviews with senior educational managers from a tertiary educational institution in Taiwan. These managers raised a number of issues, including the changing profile of tertiary students, the changing nature of English curricula, the increasing need for English teaching staff to be adaptable, highly qualified and research-active, and the growing pressure on institutions to introduce English language proficiency benchmarking. Each of these issues can be related to the impact of globalization and, in particular, the impact of the globalization of English, on the education sector. Following a critical review of selected literature on the impact of globalization on the teaching and learning of English, each of these issues, as it affects the tertiary education sector in Taiwan, was explored. Analysis of the Taiwanese national curriculum guidelines for schools, strongly influenced by academics in the tertiary education sector, revealed a number of problems relating to a lack of proficiency benchmarking and a lack of coherence, consistency and transparency in some areas. These problems may be associated with the initial phase of transition from a grammar-based curriculum to a more communicatively-oriented, outcomes-centered one. Problems of a similar type were indicated in responses to questions relating to curriculum matters included in a questionnaire distributed to a sample of teachers of English in the tertiary sector. Among other things revealed by questionnaire responses was the fact that many survey participants had received no training in English teaching. The results of a C-test (one that was initially used in a major European study) taken by a sample of entry-level and exit-level Bachelors degree students indicated a wide variation in proficiency, with individual scores differing by as much as 64 percentage points in the case of exit-level students. Furthermore, there was a difference of almost 10 percentage points between the mean scores of students from two different institutions who had majored in English. These results indicate some of the difficulties that Taiwan faces in attempting to establish graduation proficiency benchmarking. -ii- C-test participants completed a background questionnaire, the responses indicating a generally positive attitude towards English-speaking people, a general willingness to use English in situations where there was the option of not doing so, and a strong tendency towards instrumental motivation. Although one of the factors that appeared to have a positive impact on C-test performance was time spent in an English-speaking country, fewer than 18% of respondents had done so. Although there appears to be considerable anxiety and uncertainty associated with the teaching of English at tertiary level in Taiwan, and some genuine cause for concern, there are also many positive indicators of future success. Teachers and educational managers are aware of the problems they currently face and appear determined to resolve them. Taiwanese academics are increasingly involved in language-related research and increasingly prepared to interrogate their own practices, and Taiwan, unlike some other countries in Asia, is moving towards graduation proficiency benchmarking.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language teaching in Taiwan</field><field name="subject">English proficiency testing</field><field name="subject">globalization of English</field><field name="subject">attitudes perspectives and competencies of English language teachers in Taiwan</field><field name="subject">backgrounds and perspectives of students of English in Taiwan</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ngauruhoe inner crater volcanic processes of the 1954-1955 and 1974-1975 eruptions</field><field name="creator">Krippner, Janine Barbara</field><field name="description">Ngauruhoe is an active basaltic andesite to andesite composite cone volcano at the southern end of the Tongariro volcanic complex, and most recently erupted in 1954-55 and 1974-75. These eruptions constructed the inner crater of Ngauruhoe, largely composed of 1954-55 deposits, which are the basis of this study. The inner crater stratigraphy, exposed on the southern wall, is divided into seven lithostratigraphic units (A to G), while the northern stratigraphy is obscured by the inward collapse of the crater rim. The units are, from oldest to youngest: Unit A, (17.5 m thick), a densely agglutinated spatter deposit with sharp clast outlines; Unit B, (11.2 m) a thick scoria lapilli deposit with local agglutination and scattered spatter bombs up to 1 m in length; Unit C, (6.4 m thick) a clastogenic lava deposit with lateral variations in agglutination; and Unit D, (10 m thick) a scoria lapilli with varying local agglutination. The overlying Unit E (15 cm thick) is a fine ash fallout bed that represents the final vulcanian phase of the 1954-55 eruption. Unit F is a series of six lapilli and ash beds that represent the early vulcanian episode of the 1974-75 eruption. The uppermost Unit G (averaging 10 m thick) is a densely agglutinated spatter deposit that represents the later strombolian phase of the 1974-75 eruption. Units A-D juvenile clasts are porphyritic, with phenocrysts of plagioclase, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, minor olivine, within a microlitic glassy groundmass. Quartzose and greywacke xenoliths are common in most units, and are derived from the underlying basement. The 1954-55 and 1974-75 eruptions are a product of a short-lived, continental arc medium-K calc-alkaline magma. The magma originated from the mantle, then filtered through the crust, undergoing assimilation and fractionation, and evolving to basaltic andesite and andesite compositions. The magma body stagnated in shallow reservoirs where it underwent further crustal assimilation and fractionation of plagioclase and olivine, and homogenisation through magma mixing. Prior to the 1954-55 eruption a more primitive magma body was incorporated into the melt. The melt homogenised and fed both the 1954-55 and 1974-75 eruptions, with a residence time of at least 20 years. The 1954-55 eruption produced alternating basaltic andesite and andesite strombolian activity and more intense fire fountaining, erupting scoria and spatter that built up the bulk of the inner crater. A period of relative quiescence allowed the formation of a cooled, solid cap rock that resulted in the accumulation of pressure due to volatile exsolution and bubble coalescence. The fracturing of the cap rock then resulted in a vulcanian eruption, depositing a thin layer of fine ash and ballistic blocks. The 1974-75 eruption commenced with the rupturing of the near-solid cap rock from the 1954-55 eruption in an explosive vulcanian blast, the result of decompressional volatile exsolution and bubble coalescence, and possible magma-water interaction. The eruption later changed to strombolian style, producing a clastogenic lava that partially flowed back into the crater.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">volcano</field><field name="subject">Ngauruhoe</field><field name="subject">eruption</field><field name="subject">strombolian</field><field name="subject">vulcanian</field><field name="subject">fire fountain</field><field name="subject">composite cone</field><field name="subject">Tongariro</field><field name="subject">TVZ</field><field name="subject">TgVC</field><field name="subject">volcanic</field><field name="subject">volcanology</field><field name="subject">Taupo Volcanic Zone</field><field name="subject">stratovolcano</field><field name="subject">basaltic andesite</field><field name="subject">andesite</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2760</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Material Synthesis: Negotiating experience with digital media</field><field name="creator">McLaren, Sasha</field><field name="description">Given the accessibility of media devices available to us today and utilising van Leeuwen's concept of inscription and synthesis as a guide, this thesis explores the practice of re-presenting a domestic material object, the Croxley Recipe Book, into digital media. Driven by a creative practice research method, but also utilising materiality, digital storytelling practices and modality as important conceptual frames, this project was fundamentally experimental in nature. A materiality-framed content analysis, interpreted through cultural analysis, initially unraveled some of the cookbook's significance and contextualised it within a particular time of New Zealand's cultural history. Through the expressive and anecdotal practice of digital storytelling the cookbook's significance was further negotiated, especially as the material book was engaged with through the affective and experiential digital medium of moving-image. A total of six digital film works were created on an accompanying DVD, each of which represents some of the cookbook's significance but approached through different representational strategies. The Croxley Recipe Book Archive Film and Pav. Bakin' with Mark are archival documentaries, while Pav is more expressive and aligned with the digital storytelling form. Spinning Yarns and Tall Tales, a film essay, engages and reflects with the multiple processes and trajectories of the project, while Extras and The Creative Process Journal demonstrate the emergent nature of the research.

Specifically, concern centred on a perceived inequality of sacrifice, which saw brave soldiers die on the front lines, whilst other men remained on the home front, apparently avoiding duty. This thesis charts the prevailing and powerful ideas that circulated during wartime New Zealand around these two stereotypes; on the one hand there was the soldier, the ideal of service and duty; on the other, the conscientious objector, a target for the derogatory label of 'shirker'. While there are a few select critical works which examine the experiences of New Zealand World War One conscientious objectors, such We Will Not Cease (1939) and Armageddon or Calvary (1919), there is a near complete absence of studies which examine the home front and ask how conscientious objectors were perceived and consequently judged as they were. It is the contention of this thesis that ideas around the soldier and the 'shirker' were interrelated stereotypes and that both images emerged from the process of mass mobilisation; a highly organised war effort which was largely dependent for its success upon the cooperation of wider civilian society. In sum, the thesis examines and analyses the ideas within mainstream New Zealand society as they appeared in public sources (notably newspapers, cartoons and government publications), and in doing so, tracks how social mores and views towards duty, sacrifice and service were played out at a time of national and international crisis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">First World War New Zealand</field><field name="subject">cartoons as historical sources</field><field name="subject">wartime society</field><field name="subject">war cartoons</field><field name="subject">conscientious objection</field><field name="subject">social dissent</field><field name="subject">world war</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How can we help you? Communicating Social Welfare</field><field name="creator">Schoenberger-Orgad, Sehai</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the ways in which public sector organisations communicate with people from lower socio-economic communities. The study is guided by the research question: Do the existing communication strategies of public sector organisations serve the needs of low decile communities in New Zealand? The study looks at the communication strategies used by three public sector organisations - Ministry of Social Development, Inland Revenue and Hamilton City Council - to interact with residents of a low-decile neighbourhood in Hamilton. Positioned within the critical theoretical paradigm (e.g., Deetz, 2005; Mumby, 2000) which looks at issues of power, domination and asymmetry in terms of communication practices, the research shows how social policy is socially constructed in order to serve the political aims of the public sector but is not necessarily constructed in terms of the target publics of that organisation.  The study uses a three dimensional discourse analysis - text, context, and social practices (Fairclough, 1992) - to analyse the formal communication and information dissemination structures, processes, and texts of these organisations and to examine the ways in which some of the intended target publics of these organisations make sense of them and respond to them. The study includes an analysis of public documents put out by the organisations as well as interviews with youth workers, social workers, and representatives of the specific neighbourhood community.  Juxtaposing the textual analysis with the analysis of the interviews facilitates an evaluation of whether the communication strategies of the organisations relate to the context of the socio-cultural practices of lowdecile neighbourhoods.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social welfare communication</field><field name="subject">critical discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Aotearoa New Zealand</field><field name="subject">low socio-economic communities</field><field name="subject">social construction</field><field name="subject">critical theory</field><field name="subject">public communication models</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2763</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soil climate and permafrost temperature monitoring in the McMurdo Sound region, Antarctica</field><field name="creator">Adlam, Leah Seree</field><field name="description">A soil climate monitoring network, consisting of seven automated weather stations, was established between 1999 and 2003 in the McMurdo Sound region of Antarctica. Soil temperature, soil water content, air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed and direction are recorded hourly and downloaded annually. Two 30 m deep permafrost temperature monitoring boreholes were established adjacent to the soil climate stations in the Wright Valley and at Marble Point in January 2007. Sixteen thermistors (accurate to &#177;0.1&#176;C) were installed in each borehole measuring temperature once every hour and recording the mean every six hours. One year of permafrost temperatures were available (January 2007 to January 2008). The overall aim of this thesis was to make use of the soil climate monitoring database from 1999 to 2007 to investigate Antarctic soil climate.  Active layer depth (depth of thawing) varied inter-annually, with no significant trend between 1999 and 2007. The active layer increased with decreasing latitude (R2 = 0.94), and decreased with increasing altitude (R2 = 0.95). A multiple regression model was produced whereby active layer depth was predicted as a function of mean summer air temperature, mean winter air temperature, total summer solar radiation and mean summer wind speed (R2 = 0.73). Annual temperature cycles were observed at all depths in the boreholes. At Marble Point, an annual temperature range of lt;1&#176;C occurred at 15.2 m, lt;0.5&#176;C at 18.4 m and lt;0.1&#176;C at 26.4 m and at Wright Valley, an annual temperature range of lt;1&#176;C occurred at 14.0 m, lt;0.5&#176;C at 17.2 m and lt;0.1&#176;C at 25.2 m. Given that the depth of  Zero Annual Amplitude  determined depends on the sensitivity of the measurement method, it is suggested that instead of referring to a depth of  Zero Annual Amplitude , the depth at which the annual temperature range is less than a given value is a more useful concept. Mean annual and mean seasonal air and soil temperatures varied inter-annually and there was no significant trend of warming or cooling over the 1999 - 2007 period. Mean annual air temperatures were primarily influenced by winter air temperatures. Mean annual and mean summer soil temperatures were warmer than air temperatures due to heating by solar radiation. Mean summer air temperatures correlated well with the Southern Annular Mode Index (SAMI) at all sites (0.61 lt; R2 lt; 0.73) except Victoria Valley; however there was no correlation between mean annual or mean winter temperatures and the SAMI. Air temperature was linearly correlated with near-surface soil temperature (1.3 - 7.5 cm) (R2 gt; 0.79). Near-surface soil temperature was strongly correlated with incoming solar radiation at Victoria Valley (0.14 lt; R2 lt; 0.76) and Granite Harbour (0.49 lt; R2 lt; 0.82), but was not significantly correlated at other sites (0 lt; R2 lt; 0.57). There was no significant correlation between air temperature and wind speed, air temperature and solar radiation and near-surface soil temperature and wind speed, despite occasions of strong correlation on the diurnal time scale. Diurnal summer cycles in air and soil temperatures were driven by solar radiation. Multiple regressions combining the effects of air temperature, solar radiation and wind speed approximated near-surface soil temperatures well at every site during both summer and winter (0.88 lt; R2 lt; 0.98).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Permafrost</field><field name="subject">active layer</field><field name="subject">phase lag</field><field name="subject">mean annual temperatures</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of koi carp (Cyprinus carpio) movement in the Waikato region using laser ablation otolith microchemistry</field><field name="creator">Blair, Jennifer Marie</field><field name="description">The koi carp Cyprinus carpio is an invasive fish that has reached high numbers and biomass in the North Island of New Zealand, particularly in the Waikato region. This species has a variety of negative effects on aquatic ecosystems, increasing turbidity, uprooting aquatic macrophytes, and affecting water column nutrient levels. Recent research in Australia and New Zealand has shown that adult carp, though largely restricted to small scale movements, are capable of moving long distances. Movement in adult carp may be underestimated by these studies, and comparatively little is known about the movement of smaller carp. This study examined the feasibility of using laser ablation otolith microchemistry to track koi carp movement and identify spawning areas.  Water samples from six locations (Lake Waahi, Lake Whangape, Lake Waikare, the Whangamarino River, and the Waikato River at Aka Aka and Rangiriri) were analysed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Significant differences between sites were found in the water concentrations of many elements. Koi carp were collected from the above locations, as well as from Opuatia Stream, Pungarehu Stream, the Maramarua River and Lake Hakanoa. The elemental concentrations in the asteriscus otoliths were analysed using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA&#8208;ICP-MS). Elemental concentrations in the edges and nuclei of adult koi carp and the edges of young-of-the-year (YOY) koi carp were significantly different between capture sites. No significant differences were found in elemental concentrations between sites in the nuclei of YOY koi carp.  A discriminant function analysis (DFA) was carried out using the otolith edge elemental signatures of koi carp. The model used Ba, Sr, Mg, Rb and Zn concentrations to differentiate between four capture locations: the Waikato River, Pungarehu Stream, Lake Waahi, and Lake Waikare and Pungarehu Stream. The DFA was able to correctly predict the capture location of 82% of koi carp using their otolith edge elemental signatures. The classification functions created using koi carp otolith edge signatures were then used as a training set to classify otolith nucleus signatures. The otolith nuclei of 80% of YOY koi carp were classified to their site of capture, suggesting they had not moved between locations. The majority of adult koi carp caught at Lake Waikare, Whangamarino River, Pungarehu Stream and Opuatia Stream had nucleus signatures matching their capture sites, indicating that these fish originated from their capture location. Koi carp from other sites likely moved there from another location. The majority of adult koi carp (88%) caught at the Waikato River at Rangiriri had otolith nucleus signatures matching Lake Waikare and Pungarehu Stream. Adult koi carp caught at Lake Waahi and the Waikato River at Aka Aka had otolith signatures corresponding to a range of locations. While some areas (Lake Waikare, Pungarehu Stream) appear to have resident koi carp populations that likely originated there, others (Lake Waahi, the Waikato River) appear to have koi carp populations of mixed origin. These results indicate that Lake Waikare, Pungarehu Stream and the Whangamarino River may be important sources of koi carp recruits in the lower Waikato region.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Carp</field><field name="subject">Cyprinus carpio</field><field name="subject">LA-ICP-MS</field><field name="subject">movement</field><field name="subject">otolith chemistry</field><field name="subject">fish recruitment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2765</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of heavy metal contamination on burial rates of Austrovenus stutchburyi: Implications for sediment transport</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Julia Marie</field><field name="description">Urbanisation in coastal catchments has significantly increased not only the input of terrestrial sediment to the marine environment but also the input of contaminants.  In Tamaki Estuary, Auckland, heavy metals have accumulated in the upper estuarine muddy sediments and metal contamination has been detected on downstream intertidal sandflats.  Sub-lethal levels of heavy metal contamination may affect the growth and behaviour of benthic organisms, which in turn may influence key ecosystem processes and productivity.  The aim of this study was to examine whether the burial rate of an ecologically important bivalve species (Austrovenus stutchburyi) differed between a contaminated and a lesser-contaminated site and whether burial rates were affected by density.  A secondary aim was to determine whether the burial of Austrovenus affected sediment transport and consequently if this was affected by density.  This study demonstrated no consistent difference in burial time between source populations (sites).  This was explained by a lack of measured difference in the condition index and heavy metal tissue loading of Austrovenus used throughout this study.  The present range of contamination measured in Tamaki Estuary, Auckland, did not have negative biological consequences on the key ecosystem engineer, Austrovenus stutchburyi.  Contamination levels in Tamaki Estuary may not be high enough to cause major physiological or behaviour changes to infaunal organisms, such as Austrovenus.  Sediment erodability was not significantly correlated with any measured environmental and biotic factors.  Austrovenus density was the only predictor variable that could be used to explain any variation in sediment erodability.  There was no significant density effects observed between the amounts of sediment eroded for densities gt; 150 ind. m-2.  There was a significant difference between sediment void of Austrovenus (0 ind. m-2; smooth, flat undisturbed sediment surface) and sediment containing Austrovenus (gt;150ind. m-2; physical structure on/in the sediment surface, increase in bed roughness).  These results indicate that there is little or no effect of Austrovenus on the critical erosion threshold, suggesting that in the absence or presence of Austrovenus the current required to erode 10 g m-2 of sediment would remain somewhere between 28.5 and 30.5 cm s-1.  This study found that there was considerable variation in the burial rate of individuals and the greatest variation was recorded in the lowest density treatments (150 ind. m-2), which corresponded to the same density that had the greatest variation in sediment erodability.  Further investigations are needed to gain a better understanding into the important roles (the importance of the various feedbacks and limitations and interrelationships) that Austrovenus play in the soft-sediment ecosystem, as losses of this species are likely to have large-scale impacts on the wider soft-sediment communities and ecosystem functioning.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Austrovenus stutchburyi</field><field name="subject">heavy metals</field><field name="subject">sediment</field><field name="subject">bioturbation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Creation of Sustainable Development: What it means to CFOs in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dimitrov, Dara K.</field><field name="description">Abstract currently unavailable</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">definition of sustainability</field><field name="subject">drivers and barriers of sustainability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2767</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Communicaiton for Poverty Alleviation: How Aid and Development Agencies in New Zealand View the Relationships Between Communication and Development</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Michelle</field><field name="description">A highly debated topic of the last few decades has centred on the idea of communication as a means for poverty reduction. With two-thirds of the world's population living in poverty, there is a dire need to understand why global poverty and inequality continue to increase, and what role communication can, and is playing in the fight against poverty. This study therefore seeks to understand how three aid and development agencies in New Zealand, New Zealand Aid (NZAID), Oxfam New Zealand (NZ), and Christian World Service (CWS), construct poverty in the context of international development. Additionally it seeks to establish how these three organisations view relationships between communication and poverty. Eleven semi-structured, in-depth interviews with key informants were conducted, transcribed, and analysed in order to extract information surrounding the issues of poverty and international development. From this analysis, it is evident that these three organisations recognise official and unofficial definitions of poverty. It is also apparent that these definitions of poverty affect the ways in which these organisations view the causes of poverty, as well as their outlook on international development. Furthermore, three topics emerged when examining relationships between communication and poverty: communication with local people and local organisations, communication about local people and local organisations, and dealing with communication issues through accountability, transparency, and legitimacy. Implications on communication and development theory as well as theory on the discursive constructions of poverty are addressed. Finally, this study addresses practical implications for aid and development agency practice, and offers recommendations for further study in the area development communication.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international development</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">poverty</field><field name="subject">NGOs</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inclusive education for children with disabilities in Fiji: Teacher perspectives and attitudes</field><field name="creator">Daveta, Mereoni Laveti</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to examine teacher perspectives and attitudes on inclusive education for children with disabilities in Fiji. Teachers' perspectives and attitudes are crucial in providing insights that could help improve education and services for children with disabilities in regular schools in Fiji. A qualitative approach using semi structured interviews was selected as the methodology for this research. Nine teachers from nine different schools in Suva, the capital city of Fiji, participated in this research. The nine participants were selected from three different school settings. Three of the participants were from special schools, three were from primary schools and three were from secondary schools. Data collected showed that teachers support inclusive education, however, they had reservations on the inclusion of students with severe disabilities. Several factors were identified to influence teachers' attitudes towards inclusion. The most common factors were severity of disability that the students had, inadequate training of teachers on teaching students with disabilities, inadequate government funding, lack of specialised resource personnel and lack of appropriate equipment and resources to support students and teachers in the teaching learning process. Limited commitment from the Ministry of Education and limited participation and consultation of teachers on policy and curriculum design were also identified as contributing factors for non inclusion of students with disabilities in regular schools. Teachers need to change their perspectives and attitudes and schools need to be welcoming and prepared to accept all students with disabilities into the general education system in Fiji.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">inclusive education</field><field name="subject">Fiji</field><field name="subject">teacher perspectives</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2769</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Student Stress Reaction Styles': The Effects Of Stress Appraisal, Control Perceptions And Personality</field><field name="creator">de France, Mary Anna</field><field name="description">Academic study can present many stressful situations. An adaptive coping style is one of the essential factors for university students to cope effectively with stressors in their lives, allowing for an effective level of performance while protecting from stress related side effects. Previous research has identified the relationship between stressful life events and the onset of illness. This current study extends on previous research and identifies dispositional factors and stressors specific to social interactions and educational settings and their resulting impact on student coping. This study explored the somewhat controversial concept of 'coping styles' by investigating a comprehensive model of coping that included two stressors (workload related demands and a social interaction), stressor appraisal, dispositional resources, the situational resources of perceived control and perceived levels of coping effectiveness. An online questionnaire was completed by 257 participants from seven major universities around New Zealand. Problem-solving coping was positively correlated with perceived levels of coping effectiveness while avoidance coping was negatively correlated with coping effectiveness. The traits of neuroticism and conscientiousness appeared to predispose individuals to cope in predictable ways across situations when confronting adversity, lending support for the notion of coping styles. Results of the moderated regression analyses found that neuroticism and conscientiousness were significant moderators between stressor appraisal and coping behaviours used. The major implications from this research are that educational institutes need to offer on campus services that can support and educate students regarding their tendencies to engage in maladaptive and adaptive coping behaviours and under what circumstances trigger the use of maladaptive coping behaviours. Assistance could be tailored specifically to each individual and their likely coping responses chosen, by including a measure of personality. In the final chapter, conclusions are discussed with regard to implications of this research to educational institutes, students and the need for future research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stress reaction styles</field><field name="subject">personality</field><field name="subject">university students</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2770</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of a Mollicute-like organism inhabiting the human gastrointestinal tract</field><field name="creator">Care, Andrew Shane</field><field name="description">The microflora inhabiting the human gastrointestinal tract can be considered an essential 'metabolic organ', in a symbiotic relationship with its host. Due to the low cultivability and inappropriate sampling methodology the microflora is poorly explored and ill-defined. Preliminary, molecular-based research at the University of Waikato revealed the presence of 16S rRNA gene sequences originating from novel Mollicute-like species inhabiting the human GI tract. A ~830bp 'consensus' sequence representing these novel Mollicute-like sequences was classified within the Mollicute Genus Anaeroplasma the type species of which is Anaeroplasma abactoclasticum. It also displayed near exact matches with 16S rRNA sequences obtained from the human GI tract and matches of high similarity to those from the mouse GI tract in the NCBI database.  This thesis describes an attempt to design and create primers that would amplify and characterize full-length versions of these Mollicute-like sequences from samples obtained from the mucosal surface of the human gastrointestinal tract. Primers sets targeted extended 5' and 3' versions of these novel 'known' sequences and were designed from sequence matches found in the preliminary work and other related sequences from the NCBI database.  The attempt to amplify a full-length version of these novel Mollicute-like sequences was proven to be unsuccessful. No sequences were classified within the Genus Anaeroplasma, although 81% of amplicons from the 5' extending primer sets were classified within the same division as the Mollicutes, the Firmicutes, only 6% of the sequenced amplicons from the 3' extending primer set belonged to this division. Phylograms containing these 'relevant' sequences and the 'consensus' sequence grouped the 'consensus' sequence separately, indicating a lower relatedness than would have been seen if any of the amplicons contained the 'consensus' sequence.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mollicute</field><field name="subject">anaeroplasma</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal tract</field><field name="subject">microflora</field><field name="subject">microbiome</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2771</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluxes of Energy and Water Vapour from Grazed Pasture on a Mineral Soil in the Waikato</field><field name="creator">Kuske, Tehani Janelle</field><field name="description">The eddy covariance (EC) technique was used to measure half hourly fluxes of energy and evaporation from 15 December 2007 to 30 November 2008 at the Scott Research Farm, located 7 km east of Hamilton. Many other supporting measurements of climate and soil variables were also made. The research addressed three objectives: 1. To examine the accuracy of the eddy covariance measurement technique. 2. Understand the surface partitioning of energy and water vapour on a diurnal to annual timescale. 3. Compare measurements of evaporation to methods of estimation. Average energy balance closure at Scott Farm was deficient by 24%, comparable to published studies of up to 30%. Three lysimeter studies were carried out to help verify eddy covariance data. These resulted in the conclusions that; 1) lysimeter pots needed to be deeper to allow for vegetation rooting depths to be encompassed adequately; 2) forcing energy balance closure was not supported by two of the studies (summer and winter); 3) latent heat flux (&#955;E) gap filling of night time EC data during winter over estimated values by about 10 W m-2; and 4) the spring lysimeter study verified eddy covariance measurements including the closure forcing method. Some uncertainty still exists as to the accuracy of both lysimeter and EC methods of evaporation measurement because both methods still have potential biases, however for the purpose of this study, it would appear data are sufficiently accurate to have confidence in results. Energy and water vapour fluxes varied on both a diurnal and seasonal timescale. Diurnally, fluxes were small or negative at night and were highest during the day, usually at solar noon. Seasonally, spring and summer had the highest energy and evaporation fluxes and winter rates were small but tended to exceed available energy supply. Evaporation was constrained by soil moisture availability during summer and by energy availability during winter. Estimated annual evaporation at Scott Farm was 755 mm, 72% of precipitation. Two evaporation models were compared to eddy covariance evaporation (EEC) measurements; the FAO56 Penman-Monteith model (Eo) and the Priestley-Taylor model (EPT). Both models over estimated evaporation during dry conditions and slightly under estimated during winter. The &#945; coefficient that is applied to EPT was not constant and a seasonally adjusted value would be most appropriate. A crop coefficient of 1.13 is needed for Eo measurements during moist conditions. Eo began over estimating evaporation when soil moisture contents dropped below ~44%. A water stress adjustment was applied to both models which improved evaporation estimates, however early onset of drying was not able to be adjusted for. The adjusted Eo model is the most accurate overall, when compared to EEC.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eddy covariance</field><field name="subject">energy</field><field name="subject">evaporation</field><field name="subject">water vapour</field><field name="subject">evaporation models</field><field name="subject">Priestley-Taylor model</field><field name="subject">EEC</field><field name="subject">Eo</field><field name="subject">EPT</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2772</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The functionalisation of wool by tris(hydroxymethyl)phosphine for metal ion recovery</field><field name="creator">Addison, Simon James</field><field name="description">Tris(hydroxymethyl)phosphine (THP) was prepared by the addition of a stoichiometric amount of base to tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride (THPC).  Freshly prepared THP was successfully immobilised onto wool through a Mannich-type condensation reaction between a hydroxymethyl group and an amine on the wool surface, forming stable gt;P-CH2-Nlt; coupling links.  The immobilisation of THP to wool stabilised the THP, which resulted in the decreased oxidation of THP to tris(hydroxymethyl)phosphine oxide (THPO).  The presence of immobilised phosphine groups was determined colorimetrically by reaction with Ni2+ ions, which produced a bright orange nickel-phosphine complex, as well as quantitatively, by measuring nickel uptake using ICP-MS.  Immobilised THP-wool showed proportional binding for varying concentrations of metal solution.  Decreasing or increasing the concentration of the metal solution resulted in a corresponding proportional response of metal binding.  Following immobilisation onto wool, oxidation of the system by 6% H2O2 resulted in a reduced binding of 24% for Cu, 25% for Co, 27% for Ni, and 93% for Cd relative to unoxidised THP immobilised onto wool.  Additional modification of the THP-wool systems via reaction with amino acids and other related compounds overall did not appear to enhance the metal binding capacity relative to the unmodified THP-wool system.  The only modified THP-wool system that showed either retention or an increase in metal binding capacity for all metals analysed was that of 2-aminopyridine, followed by oxidation with H&#8322;O&#8322;.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">THP</field><field name="subject">tris(hydroxymethyl)phosphine</field><field name="subject">tris(hydroxymethyl) phosphine</field><field name="subject">wool</field><field name="subject">metal ion recovery</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2773</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Looking Past the Mess: M&#257;ori Homelessness and Mental Health Care</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Diana</field><field name="description">Homelessness is a pressing social and health concern that affects M&#257;ori disproportionately. This research explores the provision of mental health services to M&#257;ori who are homeless. The thesis has two primary aims. First, to document the experiences of M&#257;ori homeless people who live with mental health concerns and their relationships with mental health professionals. Second, to document the experiences of mental health professionals and how they interact with, provide care for, and build relationships with M&#257;ori Homeless. The skills of, and the difficulties faced by these professionals in provisions of quality of care are also considered. Three male and three female homeless participants were recruited from the Waikato and Auckland regions. All participants had received care from Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and/or District Health Board services (DHB). Participating mental health professionals included one female and five males. Mental health professionals included counsellors, therapists, psychologists, social workers, crisis team coordinator, and a cultural advisor. All participants took part in individual semi-structured interviews conducted in an open and conversational manner.  Key themes for homeless participants included their general life histories of mental illness, mental health service use, relationship with professionals, cultural issues, and concerns that M&#257;ori homeless wanted to discuss. Key themes for mental health professionals included their approaches when working with homeless people, relationship building, barriers to working with this group and possible solutions, linking with other professionals or organisations, and issues mental health professionals wanted to discuss. Findings highlight the importance of strong therapeutic relationships between homeless clients and mental health professionals, the need for more joined up (multi-level agency) approach to service delivery, and the importance of M&#257;ori ideology in restoring wellbeing and dignity. Findings suggest that the effectiveness of mental health service delivery relies in part on information provided by stakeholders. Information provided by homeless people and mental health professionals informs both service delivery and the ways in which practitioners can best support the needs of homeless people.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Homelessness</field><field name="subject">Homeless</field><field name="subject">interagency collaboration</field><field name="subject">narrative and mental illness</field><field name="subject">Maori research</field><field name="subject">therapeutic relationships</field><field name="subject">humanism</field><field name="subject">Maori mental health</field><field name="subject">Mental health services</field><field name="subject">sleeping rough</field><field name="subject">NGO</field><field name="subject">Recovery</field><field name="subject">Wellbeing</field><field name="subject">social determinants</field><field name="subject">homeless in New Zealand</field><field name="subject">maori models of health</field><field name="subject">barriers to health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the Biodiversity of Microbial Communities in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica: An Inter-Valley Comparison Study.</field><field name="creator">Barbier, Beatrice A.</field><field name="description">Extreme environments provide a unique source of often highly adapted and tolerant organisms. Research on organisms in these habitats has led to the discovery of novel and useful compounds and may assist in understanding the impact of global change on biodiversity. The Dry Valleys of Eastern Antarctica are vast, ice-free regions believed to be the coldest, driest desert on Earth. Despite these harsh conditions, there is an increasing amount of evidence demonstrating that the soil ecosystems of the Dry Valleys sustain a wide diversity of microorganisms. The research presented is an inter-valley comparison study which aims to scrutinize microbial communities and environmental factors driving their distribution in the Dry Valleys. Automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) was used to provide a  snapshot  of bacterial and cyanobacterial communities living in the mineral sands in Miers Valley, Beacon Valley, Upper Wright Valley and at Battleship Promontory. Rigorous analysis of physico-chemical differences between the soils of these four valleys was undertaken in hope to understand the environmental parameters driving the distribution and biodiversity of microbial communities present. Multivariate statistical analysis and ordination of ARISA and physico-chemical data revealed that bacterial communities from each valley form distinctive clusters. Conversely, cyanobacterial communities showed less diversity and a more even distribution between valleys.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microbial biodiversity</field><field name="subject">community fingerprinting</field><field name="subject">Dry Valleys</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2775</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of culture on women's leadership in Vanuatu secondary schools</field><field name="creator">Warsal, Daisy</field><field name="description">The government of Vanuatu ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1995. Following the ratification, Gender Equity in Education Policy was developed in 2005 by the Ministry of Education of Vanuatu. One of the objectives was to increase the number of women principals. However, recent statistics on women in educational leadership in Vanuatu show a decline in the number of women principals. The low percentage of women in educational leadership in the secondary schools of Vanuatu indicates that gender equity in educational leadership is still far from being achieved.  This study looks at how Vanuatu culture affects women's leadership in secondary schools and identifies ways in which women's leadership might be developed. Qualitative methods were employed to study the experiences of six women leaders and five aspiring women leaders in several Vanuatu secondary schools. The findings from the study indicate three main areas inherent in Vanuatu culture that significantly impact upon the leadership practices of the participants. The findings reveal the existence of entrenched cultural barriers in the education system, in the social structures of Vanuatu and in the attitudes of individual men, women and some students towards women leaders. These barriers, it seems, are the major impediments to women's advancement in educational leadership in Vanuatu secondary schools.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational leadership</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">Barriers</field><field name="subject">Leadership development</field><field name="subject">mentoring</field><field name="subject">networking</field><field name="subject">wantok system</field><field name="subject">social structures</field><field name="subject">systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2776</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prediction of Oestrus in Dairy Cows: An Application of Machine Learning to Skewed Data</field><field name="creator">Lynam, Adam David</field><field name="description">The Dairy industry requires accurate detection of oestrus(heat) in dairy cows to maximise output of the animals. Traditionally this is a process dependant on human observation and interpretation of the various signs of heat. Many areas of the dairy industry can be automated, however the detection of oestrus is an area that still requires human experts. This thesis investigates the application of Machine Learning classification techniques, on dairy cow milking data provided by the Livestock Improvement Corporation, to predict oestrus. The usefulness of various ensemble learning algorithms such as Bagging and Boosting are explored as well as specific skewed data techniques. An empirical study into the effectiveness of classifiers designed to target skewed data is included as a significant part of the investigation. Roughly Balanced Bagging and the novel Under Bagging classifiers are explored in considerable detail and found to perform quite favourably over the SMOTE technique for the datasets selected. This study uses non-dairy, commonplace, Machine Learning datasets; many of which are found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">skewed data</field><field name="subject">predicting oestrus</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2777</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rediscovering Arsenoacetic Acid</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Peter Stanley</field><field name="description">Arsonoacetic acid, H&#8322;O&#8323;As&#185;CH&#8322;COOH, and arsenoacetic acid, punitively [AsVCH&#8322;COOH]&#8322; have been synthesised according to historical literature methods, and have been characterised using modern techniques.

Experiments use three machine learning techniques; static prediction models, continuous learning, and reinforcement learning. Static models show the highest initial performance but are not able to beat a simple opponent. Continuous learning is able to improve the performance achieved with static models but the rate of improvement drops over time and the computer player is still unable to beat the opponent. Reinforcement learning methods have the highest rate of improvement but the lowest initial performance. This limits the effectiveness of reinforcement learning because a large number of episodes are required before performance becomes sufficient to match the opponent.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Machine Learning</field><field name="subject">Computer Games</field><field name="subject">Adaptive Learning</field><field name="subject">Game Opponent</field><field name="subject">Computer Opponent</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2779</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Composition Portfolio</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Katie Andrea Elizabeth</field><field name="description">I have enjoyed this year, writing pieces that are special to me because they relate to experiences during 2008. I've written for orchestra, choir and an ensemble of xylophones and saxophone. Each piece has extended my skills and creativity in different ways from previous compositions. Prelude to the Unspoken This work is for symphony orchestra. Last year, it was rehearsed and recorded by the NZSO as part of the NZSO/Todd Young Composers Awards 2008. The pieces were recorded in the Michael Fowler Centre and conducted by Hamish McKeich. It was exciting to hear the piece come alive and watch the orchestra rehearse. Now I have heard the recording in a calmer state and know what it actually sounds like, I have been able to evaluate some decisions and whether or not they worked. As long as I have played instruments, I have played in orchestras. I can draw on these experiences when composing because as a clarinettist, you sit in the middle of the orchestra, and can hear the different sections playing and how their parts/notes relate to the rest of the orchestra. As a percussionist, hearing the orchestra from the back (when counting rests!) also reveals a different point of view. This year I chose to compose a slower, more contemplative piece. Last year, my compositions were dense and busy, so writing this piece required me to use space and texture in new ways. The title Prelude to the Unspoken alludes to something being stated but stopping before anything is revealed. A Schulwerk Orffering I was inspired to compose for the forces used in this piece because of an Orff- Schulwerk teacher training course I attended in 2008. As part of the Masters of Music degree, I completed a Level 1 workshop and on-line component - Orff Music Education-Theory and Practice 1, and more recently, completed the Level 2 workshop. Orff-Schulwerk education is a holistic, hands-on approach that explores music physically and through different instruments such as body percussion and approachable instruments (for children) such as recorders, mallet instruments and small percussion. One activity during the course was playing a tune from the Orff-Schulwerk volumes, where everyone was playing a mallet instrument - xylophone, marimba, glockenspiel, from soprano to bass, while the teacher improvised a tune on the recorder, over the top of this moving carpet of sound we were making with our ostinatos and drones. This was just like being in the middle of the orchestra. While playing my ostinato, I was in the centre of all of this sound, hearing how each simple ostinato made an interesting accompaniment. I was also influenced by Philip GIass' Fascades, where the cross rhythms of the accompaniment create a carpet of sound, while the simple saxophone melody floats over top. I wanted to create something similar with tenor saxophone and the educational xylophones. I chose to write for two alto and two bass xylophones (small, educational instruments with no chromatic notes). These instruments were available at the course and I was able to have these with me while I composed. Because I do not usually play a mallet instrument, I composed ostinatos that I was able to play. All the techniques are those explored in Orff-Schulwerk - ostinato, drone, sound carpet, imitation. The saxophone sits quite high in the first movement, holding long notes, while in the second movement, the saxophone is active with a wide range of notes. I recently had an item about this piece in the Orff New Zealand Aotearoa newsletter 'Sounding Orff'. I hope to get a recording/performance of this piece from a response to the newsletter. Missa Brevis I sing in the Hamilton Civic Choir and have sung many Masses so was interested in writing a Missa Brevis. The movements Kyrie, Gloria, Sanctus, Benedictus and Agnus Dei are for SATB with some movements scored for divisi voices. The style of this piece is approachable for many choirs because of traditional harmonic and musical organisation, while including modern arrangements of the text and approach to the music. Some choir members queried the fact that sometimes their part does not say a whole word, for example, just singing 'Dom', not 'Domine'. The words were deliberately set like this because when using block writing, as opposed to polyphony, I felt the extra syllables would change the desired musical and rhythmic texture. I wrote this piece with the Hamilton Civic Choir in mind because I know their capabilities. For example, I know the second basses can reach a low D. For the very low notes, I've added an octave option for the first basses or all basses if another choir cannot reach them. This recording by members of the choir was not up to the choir's usual standard because of time restrictions. The piano is used in my recording but is for rehearsal use only. The Gloria will be performed in the Choir's first 2009 concert in March.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Orchestra</field><field name="subject">Choir Missa Brevis</field><field name="subject">Chamber work for educational xylophones and saxophone</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2780</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Labour Market Segmentation and the Reserve Army of Labour: Theory, History, Future</field><field name="creator">Stubbs, Thomas Henry</field><field name="description">This thesis begins by revisiting and building on themes of labour market segmentation, with particular reference given to Marx's seminal account of segmentation in Capital, Vol.1 (Chapter 25). Marx distinguishes between an active army - the stable full-time employed - and the relative surplus population - the precariously employed reserve army and the residual surplus - and suggests further fragmentation of these main groups into sub-strata. Marx's perspective of segmentation is grounded in fragments of a general theory of employment that, as a long-term tendency, identifies continual advances in constant capital that abolish work and proliferate the reserve army. This thesis builds on these themes by formulating a concept, the 'transference dynamic', which underpins a general theory of employment segmentation. A short history of segmentation under capitalism traces recent phases of development in both developed and lesser-developed nations. Stress is placed on the role of political configurations that regulate capitalism in ways that can either counter the general tendency, such is the case under the Fordist model of capitalism, or strengthen its logic. The theory of employment segmentation and the lessons drawn from the historical account are spliced together with an analysis of the contemporary phase of capitalism, labelled here as the neoliberal model of development. It is demonstrated that the coercive international regulatory dynamic of the neoliberal model reasserts and extends the competitive principle of the capitalist mode of production. Through this extension, nations are transformed into competition-states vying for scarce and globally mobile capital to operate on their shores - the primary source of national prosperity and employment - by implementing capital-friendly neoliberalized policy. This analysis of neoliberal global capitalism reveals an expanding surplus population within a context of deepening international segmentation. This employment crisis is expressed as a hierarchy of nations that is determined in part by their uneven development. Those at the bottom of the hierarchy, comprising a majority portion of the world's population, contain a massive reserve army and residual surplus population unincorporated into wage-based capitalism, without any obvious support of means of life and with little hope for the future. Finally, mainstream solutions are criticized for failing to address either long-run or contemporary drivers of the employment crisis. In response, this thesis pitches a project of multi-faceted radical reform that counter-regulates capitalism by adopting a combination of local, national, regional and global forms of democratic socialist governance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">labour market segmentation</field><field name="subject">segmentation theory</field><field name="subject">precarious employment</field><field name="subject">reserve army</field><field name="subject">surplus population</field><field name="subject">socialism</field><field name="subject">Marxism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2782</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Erosion and Sedimentation Processes at Northern Waihi Beach</field><field name="creator">Bear, Alison Louise</field><field name="description">The northern sector of Waihi Beach is an example of chronic erosive tendency. The sediment deficit along the area of beach fronting the seawall means that there is often no beach at high tide. This existing situation, and the various remedial options suggested, has created an emotive issue for beach residents. Accordingly, the current study was undertaken to identify and evaluate the fundamental coastal processes impacting upon the erosion at northern Waihi Beach.  Methods used to investigate this problem included: beach profiling and shallow water hydrographic surveying; mapping of sediments and the distribution of bedforms on the inner shelf using side-scan sonar, identification of nearshore sediment transport pathways from sediment textural analyses; collection and analysis of nearshore wave and current data; and numerical modelling of wave refraction and sediment transport processes.  A side-scan sonar survey, ground-truthed by surficial sediment analyses and underwater video and diver observations, indicated that the shallow inshore zone is characterised by a relatively featureless seabed dominated by fine sands. Large shore-normal sand ridges (&#951;=0.4-2.5 m, &#955;=300-1400), with crests oriented northeast to southwest were identified between 15-30 m water depth offshore northern Waihi Beach. These very pronounced features consist of coarse megarippled (&#951;&#8776;0.12 m, &#955;&#8776;1 m) sediment.  Sediment textural analyses revealed that offshore sediments vary from fine to coarse sand, showing a seaward-coarsening progression. Beach sediments consist of predominantly fine sands, with a slight inferred fining in grain size that occurs towards the northern end of the beach. This is possibly a result of lower wave energy when subject to swell and sea waves from the north, due to sheltering in the lee of Rapitiotio Point.  80 days of wave and current data were collected offshore northern Waihi Beach, during two separate deployments in Nov/Dec 2007 and May/June 2008. The summer deployment was characterised by waves from a northeast-east origin (Hs=1.09m; Ts=7.13s). Similar conditions were exhibited during the winter deployment (Hs=0.95m; Ts=6.79s). Observed relationships between wind direction and near-bed current direction, combined with calculated sediment entrainment rates, enabled predictions of the frequency of shoreward sediment transport by bottom currents to be made. Onshore currents, associated with winds from the southwest, prevailed during the deployment period. However, observed current velocities alone were generally incapable of inducing sediment motion. Analysis suggests that wave properties are likely to govern the frequency of sediment transport in the nearshore, as their presence is required to lift sediment into suspension for dispersal by ambient background currents. Onshore movement of sediment was estimated to be ~11,800 m3/year or 2.6 m3/m. Monochromatic wave statistics measured during the field study were used to calibrate a numerical wave refraction model. The wave refraction influence of Mayor Island was found to be the major feature influencing the distribution of wave energy along the shoreline, which is likely to contribute to localised accelerated beach erosion and dune setback. Wave energy focusing at northern Waihi Beach is maximised by swell waves, resulting in greater wave heights along eroding sectors of the beach. Potential sediment transport rates were investigated. Results suggest the littoral drift direction was bi-directional at northern Waihi Beach, although net littoral drift was southeasterly during the study period. An estimated net loss of 46,200 m3/year or 10.3 m3/m was predicted for northern Waihi Beach during the present study. Longer-term drift patterns were examined using a five year record of wave data collected offshore Pukehina by Environment Bay or Plenty from 2003-2008. Similar patterns but with lower magnitudes of sediment transport were obtained, with net annual drift rates estimated to range from 1,300-58,000 m3/year. A conceptual model of nearshore sediment dynamics is proposed for Waihi Beach to identify the major factors contributing to long-term erosion in the northern sector. Approximately 115,000 m3 of sediment was estimated to be moving within the defined northern Waihi Beach littoral cell during the study period. The derived sediment budget produced a net deficit of sediment of approximately 36,000 m3/year or -8 m3/year during the year commencing November 2007. The net southeasterly littoral drift was determined the major contributor to the net erosion rate during the study period, with alongshore transport rates exceeding available supply to the beach from diabathic movement of sediment onshore.  Several aspects of the erosion problem at northern Waihi Beach are recommended to be researched further to identify what coastal management options are required.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Erosion</field><field name="subject">Sedimentation</field><field name="subject">Waihi Beach</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2783</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of inhaled bergamot and geranium essential oils on rat behaviour</field><field name="creator">Salvesen, Gregory John</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to evaluate the behavioural effects of inhaled bergamot, geranium and a combination of these oils in three novelty evoked tests of anxiety. Sixty adult Hooded Rats (Rattus norvegicus), with 10 rats randomly assigned to one of the 6 test groups; three essential oil treated groups, and three control groups. The essential oil groups consisted of bergamot, geranium and a combined group, i.e. the combination of bergamot and geranium oil. The control groups consisted of the odour and vehicle control, with the anxiolytic drug diazepam as a positive control. The behaviour of rats was assessed on the elevate-plus maze, open-field and social interaction test. Diazepam increased open arm entries and the time spent in the open arms, decreased time spent in closed arms and increased the number of head-dips and unprotected stretch-attends in the EPM. In the open-field diazepam increased immobility time, decreased ambulation, increased grooming activity and reduced the amount of time spent exploring the arena. Similarly, diazepam decreased the frequency of separations, sniffs, follows, crawls, passive and active interactions with test partners in the social interaction test. Bergamot, geranium and the combination of the two oils increased total arm entries in the elevated-plus maze. Bergamot increased locomotion and exploratory behaviour in open-field and decreased contact latency and increased passive and active interaction between the rat pairs in the social interaction test. Geranium decrease immobility and increase the time spent rearing in the open-field and also increased active interaction, i.e. partner sniffing and decreased the amount of time the rat pairs spent apart in the social interaction test. The combination of bergamot and geranium oil increased locomotion and the time spent in Zone2, and also increased exploratory behaviour, i.e. the frequency and duration of rears in the open-field. In the social interaction test, contact latency was shortened and active and passive interactions between rat pairs were increased by the combination of essential oils. The present study established that bergamot, geranium, and the combination of the two oils had a stimulating effect in the elevated-plus maze and an anxiolytic effect in the open-field and social interaction tests when inhaled. Furthermore the study also demonstrated that the combining of the oils had a potentiating effect on the anxiolytic properties of the single oils.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Essential Oils</field><field name="subject">Anxiety</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Exploration of Static Typography for Expressing The Emotive Qualities of Music</field><field name="creator">Lu, Amanda (Meng-Hsuan)</field><field name="description">This thesis explores how the pure form of static typography can express the emotive qualities of music. More specifically, how typefaces/letterforms and typographic compositions can produce emotive associations; and whether combining both aspects can enhance the emotive value.  Emotion, typography and music are the three core subject areas of this research. Using music as the medium to elicit emotions, the findings from this thesis indicate that typeface/letterform is the most effective aspect of static typography to express emotive qualities, followed by the combination of both typographic aspects, and typographic composition which has the least impact for emotive connections. Five influential factors affecting the process of emotive association between music and static typography has been found: 1) Association of typographic attributes and design principles to emotive qualities, 2) Direct association using emotive terms and adjectives, 3) Connotation through personal memory and imagination, 4) Association to human voice and human touch, and 5) Association to phonetic properties of music. Chapter 2 of this thesis presents a review of the literature from the three main subject areas. It begins from the psychology of emotions and the importance of emotional attachment in design. Next, the chapter discusses the visual logic and creation of emotions through the pure anatomy of letterforms and typographic experimentation. The third section continues with how music can evoke emotions and the analogy between the properties of music and typographic characteristics. Chapter 3  4 presents original research of this thesis, initiating with a formative pilot study where three music sequences were selected and three corresponding typographic compositions designed by the researcher. The method of matching one sequence to one design piece was employed. Chapter 4 continues with original research, where modification was made to the methodology to obtain more specific results. Each aspect of static typography was investigated individually. The combination of both aspects was also tested to examine whether it can enhance the emotive impact.  Findings from this research intend to present fresh realization to graphic designers, typographers and type designers, highlighting the tangible and enduring essence of static typography, with its power to engage the audience on an emotive level.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">typography</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">emotions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Communicating identities: new zealand fashion designers and creative exports</field><field name="creator">Beattie, Olivia Lucy Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates how New Zealand fashion designers construct and communicate a unique and fluid identity. There are two main focuses of the research. The first is how New Zealand fashion designers build and maintain a unique brand identity in the New Zealand market. This includes an in-depth analysis of the public relations and communication strategies both emerging and established fashion designers use. The second focus is how New Zealand designers communicate their brand identity to export markets. This includes an examination of how the New Zealand national identity has an effect on the communication of their identity in international markets.  This research is important as there is little scholarly research on the creative industries in New Zealand, and none on the New Zealand designer fashion industry. Therefore, this research study has been developed to advance literature in this area and provide a basis for further research. While this research study will focus on the New Zealand designer fashion industry, it is hoped that the research will be applicable to other creative industries in New Zealand.  A key element of this research is to use the in-depth analysis of the designer fashion industry to provide recommendations on identity management for the New Zealand designer fashion industry and creative industries. Ultimately, this research provides these industries with a practical guide to create and communicate a unique identity in both domestic and export markets.  A collective case study method is used to collate the data and is analysed through an interpretive framework. The New Zealand fashion designers that comprise the case studies are Annah Stretton, Robyn Brooks, Jo Robertson, and Cyb le Wiren.  Key conclusions are that organisations in the creative industries need to put together an in-depth communications plan as early as possible in their business. This should focus on the creation and communication of a unique and fluid identity in order to differentiate themselves from their competitors and allow them to actively respond to their environment. Industry bodies and New Zealand Trade  Enterprise play a key role in the development and export of creative organisations. These organisations need to develop better resources and support systems for the creative industries in order for them to reach their maximum potential.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative industries</field><field name="subject">designer fashion</field><field name="subject">public relations</field><field name="subject">organisational identity</field><field name="subject">organizational identity</field><field name="subject">branding</field><field name="subject">fluid identity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Global Environmental Change and the Politics of Sustainable Consumption in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lewin, Joanna Alice</field><field name="description">Consumption has emerged as a pivotal concept in environmental sustainability debates. Since the 1992 Earth Summit, there has been an increasing focus on the role that consumption and consumer lifestyles play in global environmental change. Agenda 21 called on countries to promote more 'sustainable consumption' patterns and lifestyles. Despite these recommendations, there are significant political and ideological challenges to implementing effective sustainable consumption policies at a global and national level.  This thesis explores the politics of sustainable consumption in New Zealand. Using critical discourse analysis and in-depth semi-structured interviews with nine consumers, I employ post-structural and cultural geography theories to unpack the problematic nature of sustainable consumption. In particular, I examine dominant environmental and consumption discourses to explore why barriers to sustainable consumption exist. It is important to examine these issues from a socio-cultural perspective, as the dominant hegemonic discourses relating to the environment and sustainability shape both policy responses and public understandings of environmental change and sustainability issues.  Prevailing policy responses to environmental change in New Zealand construct the 'environmental problem' in narrowly scientific and economic terms. Concern has centred on 'managing' carbon emissions, rather than addressing the underlying drivers of environmental degradation which lie in current political-economic structures and consumption levels. As such, environmental policy has been embedded within an ecological modernisation discourse which links sustainability with notions of 'progress' and efficiency. Under this discourse, the consumer has been repositioned as an important 'political' agent responsible for fostering sustainable consumption and environmental care. Through largely non-political and non-regulatory measures, consumers have been encouraged to reduce their 'carbon footprints' by considering the environmental impacts of their daily personal consumption habits. This approach has individualised and depoliticised environmental issues, obscured the complexities of personal consumption and sustainability, and left limited options for participation in processes of change.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Global environmental change</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">sustainable consumption</field><field name="subject">consumption</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">ecological modernisation</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2787</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diagenetic evolution of some modern and ancient cold seep-carbonates from East Coast Basin, New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Ewen, Sarah Maree</field><field name="description">Cold seep-carbonates are the microbially mediated by-products of the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) at seafloor cold seeps, and are widespread about modern continental margins and in the geologic record.  Some modern and Miocene examples of cold seep-carbonates from the East Coast Basin, North Island, New Zealand have been analysed in this study, to characterise and determine their carbonate fabrics, elemental and mineralogical composition, and stable &#948;18O and &#948;13C isotope signatures, so as to provide insights into the diagenetic changes associated with the lithification and burial of seep-carbonates.  The ancient samples were collected from the onshore middle Miocene Tauwhareparae (TWP) seep deposit, while the modern samples were obtained from the National Institute of Water and Atmosphere (NIWA) Cruise TAN0616 (November 2006) from Ritchie Ridge, offshore Hikurangi Margin.  A paragenetic sequence of diagenetic events involving early aragonitic phases, followed by late calcitic phases is defined for the seep-carbonates.  This sequence likely has relevance for understanding the fluid-cement histories of seep-carbonates more widely.  Two main carbonate mineralogies occur in each of the sample groups - modern samples are aragonitic or dolomitic, while the ancient ones consist dominantly of either aragonite or calcite.  Thus, aragonite common to both sample groups, and is interpreted to represent the initial primary carbonate precipitate in hydrocarbon seep provinces under specific fluid flux and local pore-water chemistry conditions.  Aragonite morphologies range from microcrystalline carbonate ('micarb'), to acicular aragonites that may form botryoids or spherulites.  Dolomite occurs in those modern samples which appear to constitute exhumed remnants of a former subsurface 'seep plumbing system', and so are strictly not true seabed 'seep-carbonates', but instead are part of the larger hydrocarbon seep province.  Calcite in the ancient samples is either a product of alteration and neomorphic transformation of aragonite, or derives from late stage cementation from burial fluids.  As a result of their formation processes, the calcites are generally recrystallised and have equant or 'cellular' textures.  Stable &#948;13C and &#948;18O isotope cross-plots reveal a large spread of values for the sample groups.  Ancient samples range from &#948;13C -8 to -50  PDB and &#948;18O -5.5 to +2  PDB.  Modern samples have &#948;13C values from -6 to -41  PDB and &#948;18O values ranging from +2.6 to +6.7  PDB.  The &#948;13C values suggest the majority of the methane that formed these seep-carbonates is of thermogenic origin, although some mixing from other carbon sources may have occurred.  The positive &#948;18O signatures are suggestive of carbonate formation during dissociation of gas hydrates, while the negative values possibly indicate that some of the formation fluids were warmer than normal in the 17 - 30 C range.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cold seeps</field><field name="subject">seep-carbonates</field><field name="subject">East Coast Basin</field><field name="subject">Hikurangi Margin</field><field name="subject">Rock Garden</field><field name="subject">acicular aragonite</field><field name="subject">neomorphism</field><field name="subject">methane-derived authigenic carbonates</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2788</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between work and non-work support and work-life balance in Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Chang, Ruby Yi-Ju</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between employees' supportive resource (workplace support and non-work support) and their work-life balance in Taiwan. The roles of work-life balance's four components (work-to-life conflict, life-to-work conflict, work-to-life facilitation, and life-to-work facilitation) in the relationship between support and employee outcomes (psychological wellbeing, turnover intention, affective- and continuance organizational commitment) were examined.  Eight-hundred surveys were distributed to for-profit and non-profit sectors. After eliminating the invalid questionnaires, 658 valid questionnaires were used for further analysis. The findings of this study suggested that three kinds of support (organizational support, supervisor support, and non-work support) were positively related to employees' work-life balance. However, no significant relationship was found between the availability and usage of the work-life balance policies and employees' work-life balance. More importantly, it was found that work-life balance and four components mediate the relationship between supervisor support and all employee outcomes. The relationship between employees' awareness of the policies that organization offered and favourable employee outcomes is also mediated by work-life balance. Interestingly, the availability and usage of the policies were not found to be related to either employees' better work-life balance or favourable employee outcomes. It is thus recommended that emphasizing supervisor support might be a better option than introducing various work-life balance policies for employees to achieve a better work-life balance. Otherwise, the work-life balance policies offered have to meet employees' needs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">work life balance</field><field name="subject">work-to-life conflict</field><field name="subject">life-to-work conflict</field><field name="subject">work-to-life facilitation</field><field name="subject">life-to-work facilitation</field><field name="subject">support</field><field name="subject">organizational commitment</field><field name="subject">psychological wellbeing</field><field name="subject">turnover intention</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2789</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pest or pastime? Coarse fish in Aotearoa/New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Carter, Kathryn Sarah</field><field name="description">Freshwater ecosystems are extremely important, both socially and ecologically, in Aotearoa/New Zealand. However, through detrimental practices of land-use change and the introduction of non-indigenous aquatic species, the health of freshwater areas is increasingly under threat. Coarse fish are one group of non indigenous fish that are largely perceived to have a negative effect on freshwater biodiversity and water quality. Despite this, there are people in New Zealand that value coarse fish highly, and consider their lives to be enriched through the practice of coarse angling. This thesis examines the diversity of perceptions and values ascribed to coarse fish by a variety of different environmental managers and resource users to understand how these multiple meanings influence approaches to freshwater biodiversity management in Aotearoa/New Zealand. As coarse anglers are often considered responsible for deliberate translocation of coarse fish, a space for communication and compromise between these stakeholder groups is also identified. Additionally, appropriate and effective educational methods to raise awareness of freshwater ecosystem restoration and non-indigenous invasive fish are discussed.  Social factors are often the primary determinants of whether conservation efforts succeed or fail. Grounded in the theoretical perspectives of social construction, environmental perception, political ecology, and critical environmental adult education, this thesis provides an important contribution to the practice of interdisciplinary research by demonstrating the ways in which social science complements scientific approaches to environmental management. Utilising semi structured interviews with multiple stakeholder groups and an internet survey targeted at coarse anglers this research found that, while a multitude of perceptions of coarse fish exist, there is also willingness on both sides to engage in communication and develop effective practices to aid in managing the freshwater environment. A number of suggestions for improving legislation that addresses invasive freshwater fish, and several ideas regarding education and compliance, also emerged.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">freshwater</field><field name="subject">non-indigenous fish</field><field name="subject">pest fish</field><field name="subject">biodiversity conservation</field><field name="subject">ecological restoration</field><field name="subject">social construction</field><field name="subject">environmental perception</field><field name="subject">environmental management</field><field name="subject">environmental education</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">values</field><field name="subject">social justice</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into classroom teachers' perceptions of the value of assessment for formative purposes in secondary schools in Solomon Islands</field><field name="creator">Walani, Nathan Douglas</field><field name="description">A key purpose of this qualitative study was to gain an understanding of classroom teachers' perceptions of the value and impact of formative assessment in secondary schools in Solomon Islands. The process of data collection included initial interviews with five classroom teachers selected from four secondary schools in Honiara, Solomon Islands. The interviews were conducted using semistructured interviews with each of the teachers and ended with a focus group conversation. The findings of this study indicated that formative assessment, as a classroom strategy, does have a place in secondary schools in Solomon Islands. Assessment for learning (AfL) is currently employed by these teachers, but the form of formative assessment as reported being used in Solomon Islands secondary school classrooms is limited by policies, systems and methods employed by schools. This study suggests that if classroom teachers are to become effective 'mediators of learning' they must have a better theoretical understanding of social constructivism and metacognition. Otherwise, assessment will always sit outside the process of learning, and classroom teachers and learners will always play traditional rather than contemporary roles in the learning and teaching (and assessment) process. For improvements to be made in areas highlighted in this study, focus must be on teacher knowledge and ability and the policies and practices of schools. Unless teachers, students, parents and policymakers see and value the potential of formative assessment, it will continue to be underemphasized, under-valued and under-used.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Formative</field><field name="subject">Assessment</field><field name="subject">Classroom</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">Perception</field><field name="subject">Value</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2791</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Talking About Teaching: A professional development group for preservice secondary teachers</field><field name="creator">Gesner, Emily K</field><field name="description">As teaching is a highly complex activity, so too is learning to teach. One pedagogy which has been shown to promote teacher learning is the use of small group discussion. This thesis examines the experiences of seven preservice secondary teachers at a New Zealand university who met weekly during their second practicum to discuss their experiences at their placement schools. Individual interviews conducted with five of the participants revealed that students felt positively about the weekly meetings. The preservice teachers appreciated 1) being able to hear about the experiences of other preservice teachers 2) tell others about their teaching 3) being able to seek advice and potential solutions to problems 4) the sense of personal connection and emotional support they gained during the weekly sessions. The students reported that the weekly meetings allowed them to think about their teaching from the perspective of others, and gave them time to reflect about their experiences while on practicum. This study situates these findings within the literature on initial teacher education and offers suggestions for future research using this pedagogy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">initial teacher education</field><field name="subject">preservice teachers</field><field name="subject">sociocultural learning</field><field name="subject">discussion groups</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2792</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lithology and provenance of late Eocene - Oligocene sediments in eastern Taranaki Basin margin and implications for paleogeography</field><field name="creator">Hopcroft, Bradley Scott</field><field name="description">The latest Eocene and Oligocene was a time of marked paleoenvironmental change in Taranaki Basin, involving a transition from the accumulation of coal measures and inner shelf deposits to the development of upper bathyal environments. Up until the end of the Early Oligocene (Lower Whaingaroan Stage) Taranaki Basin had an extensional tectonic setting. Marine transgression culminated in the accumulation of condensed facies of the Matapo Sandstone Member of the lower part of the Ngatoro Group. During the Late Oligocene (Upper Whaingaroan Stage) Taranaki Basin's tectonic setting changed to one of crustal shortening with basement overthrusting westward into the basin on Taranaki Fault. The major part of the Ngatoro Group in thickness, including the Tariki Sandstone Member, Otaraoa Formation, Tikorangi Formation and Taimana Formation, accumulated in response to this change in tectonic setting. Various methods of stratigraphic and sedimentological characterisation have been undertaken to evaluate the stratigraphy of the Ngatoro Group. Wireline log records have been calibrated through particle sizing and carbonate digestion of well cuttings. A suite of wireline motifs have been defined for formations and members of the Ngatoro Group. The integration with other lithological and paleoenvironmental data sources has helped to better define the Late Eocene - Oligocene stratigraphy and sedimentary facies for eastern Taranaki Basin margin. U-Pb geochronology by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) has been used to determine detrital ages for over 350 zircons from 13 samples of Late Eocene - Oligocene sandstone samples in eastern Taranaki Basin and correlative onshore North Island units. The spread of ages (1554 - 102 Ma) and the proportion of ages in particular age bands integrated with modal petrography data have aided provenance evaluation. A range of source rocks contributed to the Late Eocene - Oligocene sedimentary units analysed, mainly the Waipapa Terrane (Early Permian to Late Jurassic) as shown by 206Pb/238U zircon ages and the abundance of fine-grained sedimentary rock fragments observed in samples. The Median Batholith (i.e. Darran/Median Suite and Separation Point Suite) is also identified as a significant source, indicated by Early Triassic to Early Jurassic and Early Cretaceous 206Pb/238U zircon ages and an abundance of quartz in samples. Other minor sources identified include Murihiku and Caples Terranes, Rakaia Sub-terrane and possibly the Karamea Batholith. The Tariki Sandstone and the Hauturu Sandstone have the same source, with the main 206Pb/238U zircon ages of aggregated samples (124 - 116 Ma and 121 Ma, respectively) consistent with a Separation Point Suite/Median Batholith (124 - 116 Ma) source. Derivation of sediments from a landmass that existed to the east and southeast of the Wellington area has been inferred for the Late Eocene - Oligocene units, with subsequent migration of sediments northward into Taranaki Basin and the Waikato Region (i.e. Te Kuiti Group depocentre) via longshore drift. New provenance data have been used to revise understanding about the development of eastern Taranaki Basin margin through the Late Eocene to earliest Miocene. Three new paleogeography maps are presented for the Runangan (Late Eocene), Lower Whaingaroan (Early Oligocene) and Upper Whaingaroan (early-mid-Oligocene). New paleogeography interpretations illustrate a dramatic change in the basin development between Matapo Sandstone (Lower Whaingaroan) and Tariki Sandstone (Upper Whaingaroan) deposition, consistent with an Upper Whaingaroan age for the start of reverse movement on Taranaki Fault.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Taranaki Basin</field><field name="subject">Oligocene</field><field name="subject">Provenance</field><field name="subject">Paleogeography</field><field name="subject">U-Pb geochronology</field><field name="subject">La-ICP-MS</field><field name="subject">wireline logs</field><field name="subject">Ngatoro Group</field><field name="subject">McKee Formation</field><field name="subject">Turi Formation</field><field name="subject">Matapo Sandstone</field><field name="subject">Otaraoa Formation</field><field name="subject">Tariki Sandstone</field><field name="subject">Tikorangi Formation</field><field name="subject">Taimana Formation</field><field name="subject">Te Kuiti Group</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2793</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Summerhill school is it possible in Aotearoa ??????? New Zealand ???????: Challenging the neo-liberal ideologies in our hegemonic schooling system</field><field name="creator">Peck, Mikaere Michelle S.</field><field name="description">The original purpose of this thesis is to explore the possibility of setting up a school in Aotearoa (New Zealand) that operates according to the principles and philosophies of Summerhill School in Suffolk, England. An examination of Summerhill School is therefore the purpose of this study, particularly because of its commitment to self-regulation and direct democracy for children. My argument within this study is that Summerhill presents precisely the type of model M&#257;ori as Tangata Whenua (Indigenous people of Aotearoa) need in our design of an alternative schooling programme, given that self-regulation and direct democracy are traits conducive to achieving Tino Rangitiratanga (Self-government, autonomy and control). In claiming this however, not only would Tangata Whenua benefit from this model of schooling; indeed it has the potential to serve the purpose of all people regardless of age race or gender. At present, no school in Aotearoa has replicated Summerhill's principles and philosophies in their entirety. Given the constraints of a Master's thesis, this piece of work is therefore only intended as a theoretical background study for a much larger kaupapa (purpose). It is my intention to produce a further and more comprehensive study in the future using Summerhill as a vehicle to initiate a model school in Aotearoa that is completely antithetical to the dominant neo-liberal philosophy of our age. To this end, my study intends to demonstrate how neo-liberal schooling is universally dictated by global money market trends, and how it is an ideology fueled by the indifferent acceptance of the general population. In other words, neo-liberal theory is a theory of capitalist colonisation. In order to address the long term vision, this project will be comprised of two major components. The first will be a study of the principal philosophies that govern Summerhill School. As I will argue, Summerhill creates an environment that is uniquely successful and fulfilling for the children who attend. At the same time, it will also be shown how it is a philosophy that is entirely contrary to a neo-liberal 3 mindset; an antidote, to a certain extent, to the ills of contemporary schooling. The second component will address the historical movement of schooling in Aotearoa since the Labour Party's landslide victory in 1984, and how the New Zealand Curriculum has been affected by these changes. I intend to trace the importation of neo-liberal methodologies into Aotearoa such as the 'Picot Taskforce,' 'Tomorrows Schools' and 'Bulk Funding,' to name but a few. The neo-liberal ideologies that have swept through this country in the last two decades have relentlessly metamorphosised departments into businesses and forced ministries into the marketplace, hence causing the 'ideological reduction of education' and confining it to the parameters of schooling. The purpose of this research project is to act as a catalyst for the ultimate materialization of an original vision; the implementation of a school like Summerhill in Aotearoa. A study of the neo-liberal ideologies that currently dominate this country is imperative in order to understand the current schooling situation in Aotearoa and create an informed comparison between the 'learning for freedom' style of Summerhill and the 'learning to earn' style of our status quo schools. It is my hope to strengthen the argument in favour of Summerhill philosophy by offering an understanding of the difference between the two completely opposing methods of learning.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Matriarchal society</field><field name="subject">patriarchal society</field><field name="subject">freedom without license</field><field name="subject">sexual huminsation</field><field name="subject">sexual humanization</field><field name="subject">decolonisation</field><field name="subject">decolonization</field><field name="subject">imperialism</field><field name="subject">colonisation</field><field name="subject">colonization</field><field name="subject">globalization</field><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="subject">right wing</field><field name="subject">new right</field><field name="subject">privatization</field><field name="subject">privatisation of state owned assets</field><field name="subject">state owned</field><field name="subject">commodification</field><field name="subject">rogernomics</field><field name="subject">multinational corporations</field><field name="subject">transnational corporations</field><field name="subject">TNC</field><field name="subject">world trade organisation</field><field name="subject">world trade organization</field><field name="subject">WTO</field><field name="subject">International monetary fund</field><field name="subject">IMF</field><field name="subject">world bank</field><field name="subject">self-governance</field><field name="subject">self-government</field><field name="subject">self-regulation</field><field name="subject">autonomous thinking</field><field name="subject">autonomy</field><field name="subject">critical pedagogy</field><field name="subject">New Zealand curriculum</field><field name="subject">vision</field><field name="subject">principles</field><field name="subject">values</field><field name="subject">key competencies</field><field name="subject">learning areas</field><field name="subject">neo-liberalism</field><field name="subject">neo-liberal</field><field name="subject">NZ educational reforms</field><field name="subject">hegemony</field><field name="subject">bulk funding</field><field name="subject">NZEI</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Education Institute</field><field name="subject">Post Primary Teachers Association</field><field name="subject">PPTA</field><field name="subject">native</field><field name="subject">schooling</field><field name="subject">A.

In order to examine if the results were due to the procedure and the parameters, or the species used, Experiment 4 attempted to obtain shifts in preference using simultaneous onset of stimuli with the same species. The results demonstrated no changes in preference but an increase in proportion of self-control choices was shown.

Challenging behaviour is any form of behaviour that interferes with children's learning or normal development; is harmful to the child, other children or adults; or puts a child in a high risk category for later social problems or school failure. The purpose of this study was to gain an understanding of the link between undesirable behaviours of students and their effect on classroom learning culture, as one of the key factors in behaviour management is in understanding why challenging behaviour occurs. The qualitative nature of this research allowed for the exploration of both teacher and student narratives by learning from their experiences regarding challenging behaviour and its effect on a classroom learning culture. The literature review revealed that it is important, that teachers have a personal definition of challenging behaviour and reflect on their own personal beliefs and the beliefs of others regarding the understanding of challenging behaviours. Research, reviewed in Chapter 2 has indicated that challenging behaviour is strongly context dependent as seen particularly in the impact of different cultural contexts on that behaviour, that learning and behaviour are socially and culturally acquired and that academic learning and social learning are interconnected. It is the teachers' responsibility to initiate a classroom culture that recognises the connections between learning and behaviour, especially when there are a number of cultures represented. This type of classroom culture must be acceptable to, and shared by both students and teachers, must recognise and respond to cultural difference, and must avoid deficit thinking about minoritized cultures. To achieve this, teachers need to be the ones that change the most as they are the ones who hold the power to do so. Successful teachers need to place a high value on forming mutually respectful, trusting and positive relationships with their students which will create classrooms and schools that are safe and caring and allow a stronger focus on realising potential and encourage learning. The most effective way of forming such relationships is to learn to listen to and respect student voice.  The outcomes of this study confirm findings in literature by demonstrating, that a close, positive and supportive relationship between teacher and students are essential for developing learning potential and for responding appropriately to challenging behaviour. Recognition of student voice is central to achieving these aims.  Teachers also need to be aware of cultural difference and be prepared to make shifts in their thinking so that their own culture does not totally dominate in the classroom. In this study, the student and teacher participants were representative of both M&#257;ori and European ethnicity and the findings suggest that their assertions regarding how challenging behaviours affects learning were noticeably similar. This suggests perhaps that the participants in this study felt they were in a culturally safe environment where the teachers' culture did not always dominate.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">classroom culture</field><field name="subject">student behavior</field><field name="subject">student behaviour</field><field name="subject">primary level</field><field name="subject">teacher student relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2796</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fragmentation and Restoration: Generational Legacies of 21st Century M&#257;ori</field><field name="creator">Malcolm-Buchanan, Vincent Alan</field><field name="description">The content of this thesis is premised on a reflexive examination of some historical juxtapositions culminating in critical aspects of being M&#257;ori in the twenty first century and how such aspects have informed contemporary indigenous identity. That is, the continuing acknowledgement and exponential public recognition of critical concepts which inextricably link indigenous and civic identity. The theoretical sources for this research are, in the main, derived from anthropological and religious studies, particularly on the significance of mythologies and oral histories, as well as from the oral theorising of elders in Aotearoa New Zealand. A very significant contribution from one such elder, a senior M&#257;ori woman academic, has been included in the form of the transcript of an interview. She herself had collected the views of a number of elders on myth, creating a rare and valuable resource.  In the interview she married her reflections on these with her own experiences and her cogent analyses. From the outset, it was necessary to be discerning so as to ensure the thesis workload was manageable and realistic.  For this reason the selected critical aspects that have been used to frame this research are (1) a developing Western validation (that is, acknowledgement and respect) of M&#257;ori, M&#257;ori culture and their mythology; (2) oral history (genealogy) and traditions that have remained constant despite the influences of modernity; and (3) notions of fluidity, negotiation and pragmatism regarding kinship legacies and cultural heritage. The thesis is comprised of six chapters starting from a subjective narrative leading through increasingly objective discourses that culminate in a conclusion which supports a belief that modern M&#257;ori require a balancing of critical aspects of cultural heritage, with a broad understanding of the world of the 'other', in order to realise and develop their contemporary indigenous identity.  Ultimately, indigenous ideologies, practices and knowledge recorded and examined in the world of academia today, become potential resources for tomorrow. The intention of this research is to aggregate and discuss intrinsic aspects of the M&#257;ori past as well as developing aspects of the present, in order to better understand the significance of the future, and to add to the growing corpus of indigenous worldviews.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Pakeha</field><field name="subject">Aotearoa</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Te Ao Maori</field><field name="subject">intergenerational</field><field name="subject">nation building</field><field name="subject">diffused</field><field name="subject">Christian</field><field name="subject">Ratana</field><field name="subject">Te Arawa</field><field name="subject">Tuhoe</field><field name="subject">Ngati Pikiao</field><field name="subject">Ngati Whare</field><field name="subject">spatial</field><field name="subject">temporal</field><field name="subject">historical juxtapositions</field><field name="subject">myth</field><field name="subject">oral histories</field><field name="subject">indigenous knowledge</field><field name="subject">ideologies</field><field name="subject">pre-literate society</field><field name="subject">pre-contact</field><field name="subject">Maori worldview</field><field name="subject">autochthonous</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Waitangi Tribunal</field><field name="subject">whaikorero</field><field name="subject">whakapapa</field><field name="subject">marae</field><field name="subject">whanau</field><field name="subject">hapu</field><field name="subject">iwi</field><field name="subject">ethnocentrism</field><field name="subject">institutional  marginalisation</field><field name="subject">discrimination</field><field name="subject">post-colonial</field><field name="subject">kinship</field><field name="subject">generational</field><field name="subject">continuity</field><field name="subject">dis-continuity</field><field name="subject">fragmentation</field><field name="subject">restoration</field><field name="subject">universals</field><field name="subject">historical redress</field><field name="subject">oral transmission</field><field name="subject">knowledge transfer</field><field name="subject">social control</field><field name="subject">icocnoclasm</field><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">anthropology</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">cultural memory</field><field name="subject">eponymous</field><field name="subject">unified</field><field name="subject">transitional</field><field name="subject">stratified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2797</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mana Wahine Geographies: Spiritual, Spatial and Embodied Understandings of Papat&#363;&#257;nuku</field><field name="creator">Simmonds, Naomi Beth</field><field name="description">This thesis is a theoretical and empirical exploration of M&#257;ori women's knowledges and understandings of Papat&#363;&#257;nuku in contemporary Aotearoa. The primary focus of this research is on the complexities, connections, and contradictions of M&#257;ori women's embodied relationships with the spaces of Papat&#363;&#257;nuku - spaces that are simultaneously material, discursive, symbolic, and spiritual. In doing so, I displace the boundaries between coloniser/colonised, self/other, rational/irrational and scientific/spiritual. I demonstrate that M&#257;ori women's colonised realities produce multiple, complex and hybrid understandings of Papat&#363;&#257;nuku. This thesis has three main strands. The first is theoretical. I offer mana wahine (M&#257;ori feminist discourses) as another perspective for geography that engages with the complex intersections of colonisation, race and gender. A mana wahine geography framework is a useful lens through which to explore the complexities of M&#257;ori women's relationships to space and place. This framework contributes to, and draws together, feminist geographies and M&#257;ori and indigenous academic scholarship.  Autobiographical material is woven with joint and individual semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted with nine M&#257;ori women in the Waikato region. The second strand, woven into this thesis, is a critical examination of the colonisation of M&#257;ori women's spiritual and embodied relationships to Papat&#363;&#257;nuku. The invisibility of M&#257;ori women's knowledges in dominant conceptualisations of mythology, tikanga and wairua discourses is not a harmless omission rather it contains a political imperative that maintains the hegemony of colonialism and patriarchy. I argue that to understand further M&#257;ori women's relationships to space and place an examination of wairua discourses is necessary.  The third strand reconfigures embodied and spatial conceptualisations of Papat&#363;&#257;nuku. M&#257;ori women's maternal bodies are intimately tied to Papat&#363;&#257;nuku in a way that challenges the oppositional distinctions between mind/body and biology/social inscription.

Geomorphic change was investigated through plotting difference in bathymetry graphs and conducting cross sections taken from digisitied bathymetries obtained from historical hydrographic charts from 1852, 1879, 1901, 1927, 1954 and a modern bathymetry from 2006. Two-dimensional hydrodynamic numerical modelling was conducted to investigate the changes in peak tidal current flow and potential net sediment transport between 1852 and 2006. Changes in surficial sediment patterns were determined through completing a side scan sonar survey with associated sediment samples for ground truthing of grain size and underwater videography to gather surficial shell coverage information. This was used to produce a surficial sediment coverage map which was compared to historical studies Major geomorphological findings include that the shipping channel appears to have induced minor change in the geomorphology of the FTD but such changes are similar to those identified in the historical bathymetries of 1852, 1879, 1901, 1927, 1954 prior to dredging. Significant changes have occurred on the ETD, with the majority of the ETD showing scour of 1 m while the terminal lobe has extended seawards. This is associated with historical (since 1852) narrowing of the inlet from Panepane Point to Mt Maunganui by ~ 900 m. Hydrodynamic numerical modelling has shown a significant increase in potential net tidal sediment transport in the Cutter Channel due to dredging, while the Maunganui Roads Channel shows a reduction of net potential tidal sediment transport that is associated with the dredging of this channel. The area surrounding Panepane Point undergoes significant increases and decreases in net potential tidal sediment transport both before and after dredging Investigation of the surficial sediment patterns over the FTD and ETD from sidescan sonar and bottom samples show that between 1983 and 2007 there has been a northwards extension of the area of major shell (greater than 50 %) converge in the main ebb channel as well as reduction in major shell converge in flood tidal delta ebb shield region. The Maunganui Roads Channel changes from sitly sands to medium and fine sands.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Residual Distance Plot</field><field name="subject">Van Veen Grab Sampler</field><field name="subject">Bedforms</field><field name="subject">Accretion</field><field name="subject">Depostion</field><field name="subject">Sediment Transport Pathways</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Listening to the voices of Year 13 M&#257;ori students: A case study in a New Zealand secondary school</field><field name="creator">Kay, Joan-Marie</field><field name="description">This research focuses on listening to the voices of Year 13 academically successful M&#257;ori students in a large, urban, mainstream, co-educational, decile 4, New Zealand secondary school. Traditionally, researchers have tended to emphasise the poor academic performance of M&#257;ori students in New Zealand. In contrast, this qualitative case study, however, seeks to understand what influences and motivates the academically successful Year 13 M&#257;ori students who have gained the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) Level 2 and who returned to school to study for NCEA Level 3.  Semi structured interviews as conversations with all thirteen M&#257;ori students who had achieved NCEA Level 2 formed the basis of this research. Five of their parents, seven of their teachers and the principal were also interviewed.  The findings show that these students all stress the importance of their family, in particular, one family member or significant adult in their lives who valued education and supported the student, influencing and encouraging their motivation and self-efficacy. Building positive relationships with their teachers was the next strongest influence on their academic success followed closely by the positive influence of their friends. Self-motivation was mainly extrinsic. The students perceived that the principal had little effect on their individual achievement.  The teachers also acknowledge the importance of building positive relationships with their students and acknowledge the benefits of the reflective practice provided by the Te Kotahitanga project in highlighting this factor.  The findings suggest the excellent initiatives currently taking place in the school need to be continued or strengthened and that further interventions which target particular M&#257;ori students, rather than are global across the school, should be introduced.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori Achievement</field><field name="subject">Secondary students</field><field name="subject">Year 13 students</field><field name="subject">Student voices</field><field name="subject">Student motivation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Communication satisfaction, job satisfaction, organisational commitment and intention to leave</field><field name="creator">Hopper, Melissa Loraine</field><field name="description">The retention of highly motivated, skilled and committed employees is a major concern by organisations to achieve a competitive advantage. The turnover intentions of human capital are of interest to managers, employees, and organisations today. This study explores a theoretical model of turnover intentions that included three proximal variables, job satisfaction, affective and continuance commitment, the distal variables of subordinate communication, horizontal communication, personal feedback, media quality, communication climate, supervisor communication, job-related communication, and management communication, with turnover intentions. A questionnaire was completed by 101 participants of a rental firm in New Zealand. Job satisfaction, affective commitment, continuance commitment, subordinate communication, horizontal communication, personal feedback, media quality, communication climate, supervisor communication, job-related communication, and management communication correlated with turnover intentions. The results of the mediated regression analysis indicated that job satisfaction, affective commitment, and continuance commitment are significant mediators between the eight distal (organisational communication) variables, with turnover intentions. This study highlights the necessity for managers to develop good quality relationships with their employees to improve the quality of their communication, to foster job satisfaction, affective commitment, and continuance commitment to reduce turnover intentions. The conclusion of this study discusses the practical implications for managers, and organisations and the direction for future research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organisational communication</field><field name="subject">organizational communication</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">affective commitment</field><field name="subject">continuance commitment</field><field name="subject">intention to leave employment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Community Arts Service: History and Social Context.</field><field name="creator">Ulenberg, Phillippa</field><field name="description">The Community Arts Service (CAS, 1946-1966), founded after World War Two, took tours of music, drama, opera, dance and art exhibitions to smaller centres and isolated rural areas throughout New Zealand, fostering the cultural activities undertaken by local groups. From the Auckland University College, where it originated as a branch of Adult Education, it spread to the other University College provinces and, beyond New Zealand, to Australia. As Adult Education, CAS programmes emphasised educational value and aimed to develop the tastes and level of culture in the participating communities. The Service operated through local CAS committees, encouraging rural centres to take increasing responsibility for the cultural life of their own communities. Following World War Two, themes of nationalism, decentralisation of culture and correcting the imbalances that existed between rural and urban life so as to create a more egalitarian society, were key issues in New Zealand. The CAS played a significant role in redressing these concerns but to date, have received little critical attention. This thesis, which examines the important role of the Service in the musical and artistic life of twentieth century New Zealand, is an original contribution to the cultural history of this country. Main documentary research sources consulted were regional histories, publications on New Zealand music, theatre, ballet, opera and journals on the arts from the period. Diaries, correspondence, local cultural societies' documentation and programmes of past concerts held in private collections have been valuable. The archival material for Arthur Owen Jensen and Ronald Graeme Dellow (Alexander Turnbull Library) and, the records of Auckland Adult Education (University of Auckland, Special Collections) have been a significant help. People who were involved with the CAS have generously contributed through interviews and correspondence. Newspaper cuttings in private collections and past issues of the Waikato Times held in the Hamilton Public Library have also been important sources.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">community arts service</field><field name="subject">history of music</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Off-line signature verification</field><field name="creator">Larkins, Robert L.</field><field name="description">In today&#8217;s society signatures are the most accepted form of identity verification. However, they have the unfortunate side-effect of being easily abused by those who would feign the identification or intent of an individual. This thesis implements and tests current approaches to off-line signature verification with the goal of determining the most beneficial techniques that are available. This investigation will also introduce novel techniques that are shown to significantly boost the achieved classification accuracy for both person-dependent (one-class training) and person-independent (two-class training) signature verification learning strategies. The findings presented in this thesis show that many common techniques do not always give any significant advantage and in some cases they actually detract from the classification accuracy. Using the techniques that are proven to be most beneficial, an effective approach to signature verification is constructed, which achieves approximately 90% and 91% on the standard CEDAR and GPDS signature datasets respectively. These results are significantly better than the majority of results that have been previously published. Additionally, this approach is shown to remain relatively stable when a minimal number of training signatures are used, representing feasibility for real-world situations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">off-line signature verification</field><field name="subject">signature verification</field><field name="subject">adaptive feature thresholding</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2803</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Sensitivity of Adenovirus and Herpes simplex virus to Honey</field><field name="creator">Littlejohn, Emma Sophie Vout</field><field name="description">Honey has been used for centuries as a medicine to treat various ailments and infections. A large amount of research has established that honey has potent antibacterial activity. However, the sensitivity to honey of viral species that cause infections has been studied in only a small number of cases. The aim of this study was to obtain data to clarify and extend knowledge obtained from these previous studies of honey's antiviral activity, and especially study those viruses that cause localised infections which have limited or no therapy available, which are suitable to treatment with topically applied honey. The susceptible A549 cell line and viral isolates of Adenovirus serotypes 1, 3, and 8, and Herpes simplex virus serotypes 1 and 2, were provided by the Waikato Hospital Virology Laboratory. A number of types of honey were investigated from a range of sources: Manuka honey with high concentrations of methylglyoxal,  unique manuka factor  activity, and phenolics, Honeydew and Rewarewa honeys which have high antioxidant activity, and Ling Heather honey which is high in phenolic compounds. These honeys were selected due to their range of characteristic activities in order to make comparisons with antiviral activity. A variety of tests using cell culture were developed to evaluate the sensitivity of the viruses to whole honey. Each test scored and monitored the development of morphological changes to the cells, to observe whether the honey treatment can prevent the development of these changes known as viral cytopathic effect. These included tests for: protection, in which the cells were pre-treated with, and iii incubated either with or without honey; prevention, where honey was used to treat infected cells, and in plaque reduction assays, to examine whether it can reduce the resultant number of plaques; and neutralisation, in which the virus was directly exposed to the honey for a defined period. It was found with each type of test using cell culture that many of the honeys studied can lower the severity of viral cytopathic effect or delay its onset compared with the development observed with virus that was not treated with honey. This can suggest that the antiviral activity may be a feature of more than one type of honey. In general the antiviral effect increased with the concentration of honey and time the virus was exposed to it. Manuka honey M116 at a concentration of 10% was effective in preventing the development of viral cytopathic effect of each of virus, after the viruses at concentrations in excess of the tissue culture infectious dose had been exposed to the honey for 8 hours. Enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays were used to measure the effect the successful treatments found in the extended neutralisation experiments had on viral surface proteins necessary for viral entry into the cells. The results using this technique suggested that there was very little virus present in the samples that had been treated with honey and with the untreated virus. Therefore it could not be shown whether the honey was acting via this mechanism. It is concluded from the findings in this study that honey is likely to be an effective antiviral treatment for the therapy of localised viral infections, this needs to be verified by clinical trials.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Honey</field><field name="subject">Antiviral</field><field name="subject">Virus</field><field name="subject">Treatment for viral infection</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Annual carbon balance of an intensively grazed pasture: magnitude and controls</field><field name="creator">Mudge, Paul Lawrence</field><field name="description">Soil carbon (C) is important because even small changes in soil C can affect atmospheric concentrations of CO&#8322;, which in turn can influence global climate. Adequate soil carbon is also required to maintain soil quality, which is important to if agricultural production is to be sustained. The soil carbon balance of New Zealand's pastoral soils is poorly understood, with recent research showing that soils under dairy pasture have lost large amounts of C during the past few decades. The main objective of this research was to determine an annual farm scale C budget for an intensively grazed dairy farm, with a second objective being to determine the amount of CO&#8322;-C lost following cultivation for pasture renewal, and soil pugging by dairy cattle. A third objective was to investigate the environmental controls of CO&#8322; exchange in a dairy farm pasture system. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO&#8322; was measured using an eddy covariance (EC) system from 15 December 2007 to 14 December 2008. Closed chamber techniques were used to measure CO&#8322; emissions from three cultivated paddocks and three adjacent pasture paddocks between 26 January 2008 and 5 March 2008. CO&#8322; emissions were also measured using chambers from pugged and control plots between 25 June and 5 August. Coincidentally this research was carried out in a year with a severe summer/autumn drought and a wetter than usual winter. Annual NEE measured with the eddy covariance system was -1,843 kg C ha&#8315;&#185; (a C gain by the land surface). Accounting for C in supplement import, milk export, pasture export and losses in methane, the dairy pasture system was a net sink of -880&#177;500 kg C ha&#8315;&#185;. This C sequestration occurred despite severe drought during the study, which was in contrast to other studies of grasslands during drought. Cultivation under dry conditions did not increase cumulative CO&#8322;-C emissions compared to adjacent pasture paddocks. However, when C inputs to pasture paddocks via photosynthesis were included in calculations, net C loss from the cultivated paddocks (during the 39 day study) was estimated to be 622 kg C ha&#8315;&#185; more than the pasture paddocks. CO&#8322; emissions were lower from pugged plots compared to control plots, probably caused by decreased microbial and root respiration due to wetter soil conditions, and lowered root respiration as a result of lower pasture production. Volumetric soil moisture content (soil moisture) had a dominant effect on CO&#8322; exchange at a range of temporal scales. Respiration and photosynthesis were both reduced when soil moisture was below 43% (~the lower limit of readily available water) and photosynthesis virtually ceased when soil moisture declined below 24% (~wilting point). Soil moisture also influenced the relationship between temperature and respiration and photosynthetic flux density (PPFD) and NEE. These results suggest that management related soil disturbances of occasional cultivation for pasture renewal and soil pugging, are unlikely to cause large losses of soil C. Further, a severe drought also did not cause CO&#8322;-C losses from the land surface to the atmosphere on an annual scale, in contrast to previous studies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eddy covariance</field><field name="subject">chamber</field><field name="subject">cultivation</field><field name="subject">pugging</field><field name="subject">carbon dioxide</field><field name="subject">soil carbon</field><field name="subject">treading</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gaming and Gender: Home as a Place of (Non)conformity for Women Gamers</field><field name="creator">Todd, Cherie J</field><field name="description">This research examines interactive multimedia video games that are played on technological devices such as: computers, gameboys, PlayStation, Portable PlayStation (PSP) and Xbox.

This is a particularly useful group of women to investigate because it opposes stereotypical and gender-normative notions of what it means to be a 'woman at home'. Also, to the best of my knowledge, there have not been any previous studies conducted that explore this particular group in relation to geographies of home. There is an ever expanding body of literature that focuses on 'home' and the meanings that are associated with it. This research represents an attempt to seek a new way of understanding the mutually constitutive relationship between women, home, and gaming by drawing on feminist and poststructuralist theories of identities, place and space.

It is when these achievements are compared with measures of potential and the expectations of teachers and parents that a gifted child can sometimes be declared an underachiever. The 37 gifted students taking part in this study ranged in academic achievement from high achievers to underachievers. In part one of the study a questionnaire approach was used to measure their locus of control (LOC) and learned helplessness (LH) orientations and their tendency towards resilience or vulnerability. These students were also assessed as to their choice of performance or learning goals; effort or ability attributions for success; and the fixed or flexible nature of intelligence. The results of these investigations were then compared with the expectations of their teachers and their academic performance in recent examinations. None of the factors were found to yield consistent correlation with either expectations or academic achievements. Both high achievers and underachievers were found at all measures of all variables. In part two, a phenomenographic enquiry was undertaken by interview, to investigate the students' reactions to the twin phenomena of success and failure. LOC, LH and resilience/vulnerability were controlled for in this part of the study and the sample group chosen for interview (10 students) included both high achievers and underachievers. Analysis of the interview transcripts revealed one characteristic which consistently differentiated between the underachievers and the high achievers. This was the reaction to failure. Consistently across the sample, irrespective of their LOC, LH and resilience orientations, the students achieving at the highest level were found to display an efficacious, learn-from-mistakes attitude to failure and the underachieving students displayed unhelpful reactions to failure ranging from denial to avoidance to helplessness. The terms failing well and failing badly were used to describe these two clusters of reactions. Learning to fail well, is proposed as one mechanism to help gifted underachievers improve their academic performance. This study adds to existing understandings in that its findings are contrary to much published literature and its conclusions appears to provide a new perspective on the characteristics of the gifted underachiever.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">resilience</field><field name="subject">vulnerability</field><field name="subject">gifted</field><field name="subject">locus of control</field><field name="subject">learned helplessness</field><field name="subject">academic achievement</field><field name="subject">failure</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parent Expectations of Catholic Secondary Education: A study over time in one particular school</field><field name="creator">Griffiths, William Robert</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the expectations that parents had of a particular Catholic secondary school for boys during the first half of the 1990s. By exploring in some detail the expectations of one group of parents whose children attended one particular Catholic secondary school in suburban Adelaide (South Australia), the research illuminates the larger issue of the changing nature of parent expectations of Catholic secondary schooling, and how these expectations were being shaped in the last decade of the twentieth century. The social, educational and ecclesial context within which Catholic secondary education operates has altered in the three decades following the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). The literature reviewed in this thesis indicates that parent expectations of Catholic secondary education in the 1990s were increasingly shaped by a complex variety of factors beyond traditional religious or denominational loyalty. The post-1973 organisational and administrative structures established for the delivery and development of Catholic schooling in Australia reset the centralisation/decentralisation balance. These changes in administrative centre of gravity have of themselves created a climate in which a greater range of parent expectations is evident. This research used an established questionnaire to gather data from parents about their expectations of the school as their sons entered the first year of secondary schooling. The same parents were then surveyed four years later to gauge the extent to which they believed the school had met their expectations. Exploratory analyses were conducted to investigate if there were significant statistical differences in parent expectations, or in parent perceptions of the school's meeting their expectations, that were due to different parent characteristics. In particular, the research investigated whether parent gender, religion, religious practice, level of education, or length of parent association with the school played a significant role in parent expectations. A further important research aim was to investigate the statistical properties of the research questionnaire, first used to explore parent expectations of Catholic secondary education in the early 1980s, and to suggest appropriate changes to the way in which the items and scales of the questionnaire were constructed. Eight of the nine scales of the research instrument, whether used in the first round of the survey (as the student entered Year 8, and parents were asked what their expectations were in anticipation of their child's Catholic secondary education) or the second round (as the student entered Year 12, and parents were asked to indicate the degree to which the school had met their expectations) were found to be reliable. The results from the research reported in this thesis indicate that the parents believed that the school in large measure met their expectations. The results also demonstrate that, for these parents, there was no significant relationship between their expectations of the school and the sample characteristics of parent religion, gender, or level of education. Only two parent characteristics were found to demonstrate a significant relationship with parent expectations as measured by the questionnaire scales: the frequency of parent religious practice (as measured by reported church attendance) and whether the parents had earlier enrolled their sons in the primary section of the school. A more finely-nuanced examination of the data indicated that parent religion and parent gender may indeed have an influence on parent expectations of the school, but that the influence of these parent characteristics on parent expectations of the school are mediated by the degree to which the parents practice their religion. This research appears to confirm that parent expectations of Catholic secondary schooling are not a simple function of parent religion. The research indicates that parents, whether Catholic or not, whether practising church goers or not, tend to share a reasonably coherent view of what a Catholic secondary education should include, and of what constitutes a</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic secondary education</field><field name="subject">Catholic boys schools</field><field name="subject">Parent expectations</field><field name="subject">Adelaide</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp206.10082009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Holocaust Remembrance in Australia: Gender, Memory and Identity between the Local and the Transnational</field><field name="creator">Andrews, Susan</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the cultural politics of contemporary Holocaust remembrance in Australia and how meanings about gender, memory and identity and the Holocaust are produced through different representational sites and practices. This study is an intervention in and a contribution to the interdisciplinary field of Holocaust studies. I develop analyses using approaches that draw on feminist cultural theory, gender studies and memory studies. These analyses take account of the local particularities of Holocaust memory in Australia, while showing that at the same time it reproduces and recirculates a dominant transnational Holocaust memory discourse. Silences and the politics of unspeakability are central themes of this thesis. It was my late mother&#146;s silence about her history in Nazi Germany and exile to Australia, and a theoretical silence about gender in Holocaust studies more broadly, that initially engaged me in this study.
&#182;
I am interested in the relationships between personal and public memory and their interconnections as they contribute to cultural memory of the Holocaust. In my initial case study, the Sydney Jewish Museum, I discuss the museum as a multi-textual discursive space, one which incorporates personal memory of survivors as integral to its memorial project. My second case study involves a close reading of the role of survivor guides as embodied witnesses in the museum space where their gendered performances are framed by, and provide dissonances to, its universalised Holocaust narrative. I present three further cases studies as counterpoints to the Holocaust narrative produced in the Sydney Jewish Museum, where I argue that the universalised Holocaust narrative does not allow for dialogic or discursive spaces where such unsettling stories can be told or heard.  First I analyse an Australian documentary film, The Mascot, which represents the story of an Australian man who was a child survivor from Belarus and whose memories were contested when he attempted to reclaim an authentic Jewish identity connected to his Holocaust experiences. 
&#182;
In the final two cases studies I demonstrate the value of subjective, embodied personal approaches to analysing Holocaust memory and its effects. Here I draw on my mother&#146;s story. First in the local context I narrate a necessarily fragmented account of her exile to Australia and I undertake memory work to map out some of her history as a Jewish Australian woman and the social landscapes of her political activism. In the final chapter I reconnect my mother&#146;s story from Australia to her childhood city, Berlin where I undertake a personal reading of one particular Holocaust counter-memorial in Berlin-Sch&#246;neberg.
&#182;
Despite the power of the universalised Holocaust memory discourse, these case studies illustrate the diverse particularities of experiences of the Holocaust in local and transnational contexts. An analysis of the nuances and complexities of Holocaust remembrance that takes account of such particularities, and that is also gendered, can offer valuable insights into the machinations of the genocide and how it is variously remembered in the present through mourning as well as political and historical inquiry.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Holocaust remembrance</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">local and transnational</field><field name="subject">personal silences and unspeakability.</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090810.142945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fuzzy ontology and intelligent systems for discovery of useful medical information</field><field name="creator">Parry, David Tudor</field><field name="description">Currently, reliable and appropriate medical information is difficult to find on the Internet. The potential for improvement in human health by the use of internet-based sources of information is potentially huge, as knowledge becomes more widely available, at much lower cost. Medical information has traditionally formed a large part of academic publishing. However, the increasing volume of available information, along with the demand for evidence based medicine makes Internet sources of information appear to be the only practical source of comprehensive and up-to date information. The aim of this work is to develop a system allowing groups of users to identify information that they find useful, and using those particular sources as examples develop an intelligent system that can classify new information sources in terms of their likely usefulness to such groups. Medical information sources are particularly interesting because they cover a very wide range of specialties, they require very strict quality control, and the consequence of error may be extremely serious, in addition, medical information sources are of increasing interest to the general public. This work covers the design, construction and testing of such a system and introduces two new concepts - document structure identification via information entropy and fuzzy ontology for knowledge representation. A mapping between query terms and members of ontology is usually a key part of any ontology enhanced searching tool. However many terms used in queries may be overloaded in terms of the ontology, which limits the potential use of automatic query expansion and refinement. In particular this problem affects information systems where different users are likely to expect different meanings for the same term. This thesis describes the derivation and use of a "Fuzzy Ontology" which uses fuzzy relations between components of the ontology in order to preserve a common structure. The concept is presented in the medical domain. Kolmogorov distance calculations are used to identify similarity between documents in terms of authorship, origin and topic. In addition structural measures such as paragraph tags were examined but found not to be effective in clustering documents. The thesis describes some theoretical and practical evaluation of these approaches in the context of a medical information retrieval system, designed to support ontology-based search refinement, relevance feedback and preference sharing between professional groups.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medicine</field><field name="subject">Computer network resources</field><field name="subject">Medical telematics</field><field name="subject">Medical informatics</field><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ICT in community-based lifelong learning center: model for northeast Thailand</field><field name="creator">Wech-O-sotsakda, Chanthana</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates how rural and remote communities in northeast Thailand harness information and communication technologies (ICTs) for community development and develops a new model of ICT-based lifelong learning centre for local communities.

The fieldwork covered two communities in Krainun Village, Katharawichai District and Khok Yai Community Forest, Wapi Pathum District, Mahasarakham Province. The data collection procedures included using surveys and questionnaires to develop the research agenda with the target groups while focus group techniques were used as the main data-gathering instrument to further investigate their needs and develop the CLC model. Interviews, observations, workshops and study trips were needed for additional data. A triangulation approach was used to analyse the data from surveys, interviews, observations and discussions. The basic data from the surveys were categorised into four aspects: geographical data, public utilities, social data, and economic data. Using the issues-based analysis methodology, the qualitative data from the focus groups were analysed and interpreted and triangulation was applied to difference data sources. The recorded materials were transcribed and issues related to the research questions were identified. The next step focused on developing the CLC model which applied Knowles&#8217; program development model for adult education and training. This focus on process is a distinguishing feature of this research and comprises the &#8216;new&#8217; characteristic in the model presented. The study showed that the rural communities grasped the benefits of ICTs and through concrete situations, realised that ICTs could meet their needs. ICT learning activities using a hands-on practical approach motivated them to adapt and integrate ICT in their daily life. They applied their experiences to acquire new knowledge and technology. Their CLCs were developed based on a similar model of their understanding of, and motivation to use, ICT. The model of CLC in both communities is based on their needs, including the concept of establishing a CLC, CLC objectives, CLC management, implementation and evaluation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community learning centre</field><field name="subject">Thai public policy</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Computer training</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrative approaches to modelling and knowledge discovery of molecular interactions in bioinformatics</field><field name="creator">Jain, Vishal</field><field name="description">The core focus of this research lies in developing and using intelligent methods to solve biological problems and integrating the knowledge for understanding the complex gene regulatory phenomenon. We have developed an integrative framework and used it to: model molecular interactions from separate case studies on time-series gene expression microarray datasets, molecular sequences and structure data including the functional role of microRNAs; to extract knowledge; and to build reusable models for the central dogma theme. Knowledge was integrated with the use of ontology and it can be reused to facilitate new discoveries as demonstrated on one of our systems &#8211; the Brain Gene Ontology (BGO). The central dogma theme states that proteins are produced from the DNA (gene) via an intermediate transcript called RNA. Later these proteins play the role of enzymes to perform the checkpoints as a gene expression control. Also, according to the recently emerged paradigm, sometimes genes do not code for proteins but results in small molecules of microRNAs which in turn controls the gene regulation. The idea is that such a very complicated molecular biology process (central dogma) results in production of a wide variety of data that can be used by computer scientists for modelling and to enable discoveries. We have suggested that this range of data should actually be taken into account for analysis to understand the concept of gene regulation instead of just taking one source of data and applying some standard methods to reveal facts in the system biology. The problem is very complex and, currently, computational algorithms have not been really successful because either existing methods have certain problems or the proven results were obtained for only one domain of the central dogma of molecular biology, so there has always been a lack of knowledge integration. Proper maintenance of diverse sources of data, structures and, in particular, their adaptation to new knowledge is one of the most challenging problems and one of the crucial tasks towards the knowledge integration vision is the efficient encoding of human knowledge in ontologies. More specifically this work has contributed towards the development of novel computational and information science methods and we have promoted the vision of knowledge integration by developing brain gene ontology (BGO) system. With the integrative use of several bioinformatics methods, this research has indeed resulted in modelling of such knowledge that has not been revealed in system biology so far. There are many discoveries made during my study and some of the findings are briefly mentioned as follows: (1) in relation to leukaemia disease we have discovered a new gene &#8220;TCF-1&#8221; that interacts with the &#8220;telomerase&#8221; gene. (2) With respect to yeast cell cycle analysis, we hypothesize that exoglucanase gene &#8220;exg1&#8221; is now implicated to be tied with &#8220;MCB cluster regulation&#8221; and a &#8220;mannosidase&#8221; with &#8220;histone linked mannoses&#8221;. A new quantitative prediction is that the time delay of the interaction between two genes seems to be approximately 30 minutes, or 0.17 cell cycles. Next, Cdc22, Suc22 and Mrc1 genes were discovered that interacts with each other as the potential candidates in controlling the Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) activity. (3) Upon studying the phenomenon of Long Term Potentiation (LTP) it was found that the transcription factors, responsible for regulation of gene expression, begin to be elevated as soon as 30 min after induction of LTP, and remain elevated up to 2 hours. (4) Human microRNA data investigation resulted in the successful identification of two miRNA families i.e. let-7 and mir-30. (5) When we analysed the CNS cancer data, a set of 10 genes (HMG-I(Y), NBL1, UBPY, Dynein, APC, TARBP2, hPGT, LTC4S, NTRK3, and Gps2) was found to give 85% correct prediction on drug response. (6) Upon studying the AMPA, GABRA and NMDA receptors we hypothesize that phenylalanine (F at position 269) and leucine (L at position 353) in these receptors play the role of a binding centre for their interaction with several other genes/proteins such as c-jun, mGluR3, Jerky, BDNF, FGF-2, IGF-1, GALR1, NOS and S100beta. All the developed methods that we have used to discover above mentioned findings are very generic and can be easily applied on any dataset with some constraints. We believe that this research has established the significant fact that integrative use of various computational intelligence methods is critical to reveal new aspects of the problem and finally knowledge integration is also a must. During this coursework, I have significantly published this research in reputed international journals, presented results in several conferences and also produced book chapters.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">Gene regulatory networks (GRNs)</field><field name="subject">Interaction</field><field name="subject">Computational</field><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Integration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inter-organisational cooperation and network influences in destination marketing: the case of www.purenz.com</field><field name="creator">Bhat, Sushma Seth</field><field name="description">Individual businesses from a variety of sectors network and work together to create a successful tourist experience. The interdependencies of organisations producing this experience make cooperation a necessity in destination marketing. Despite the centrality of cooperation and networking in tourism marketing relatively little empirical research has been conducted in this area. This thesis uses the case of the development of the official NZ website www.purenz.com (purenz) to examine the role, form and process of inter-organisational cooperation in destination marketing.  Drawing on in-depth interviews with thirty- five industry members involved in establishing and managing www.purenz.com between 1999 and 2006 this thesis makes a number of contributions to both the marketing and tourism literature. The thesis confirms that there are considerable difficulties in broadening the marketing role of the national tourism organisation (NTO) beyond destination promotion.  The study also finds that destination marketing and destination management are still perceived as separate processes in the NZ tourism industry. In addition, the results of this study provide support for the view that the social networks in which firms are embedded have a considerable influence on inter-organisational alliance formation. This thesis contributes to the development of theoretical approaches to the study of cooperation in destination marketing by identifying five levels of cooperation in destination marketing: passive acceptance, support, alignment, contribution and pooling.  The levels are based on the different types of input that may be required from stakeholders by the NTO.  The level of cooperation desired in a particular context is a strategic choice to be made by the destination marketing management.  This choice is affected by the existing characteristics of the tourism network; the NTO leaders&#8217; perception of the need for and value of cooperation in destination marketing and also by the extent of shared understanding of the scope of destination marketing management among tourism stakeholders. The research points to the need to develop further the network characteristics affecting cooperation in destination marketing.  Further work is also needed to develop a more complete profile of the five levels of cooperation identified by this study and the investment required to achieve each level of cooperation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Destination marketing</field><field name="subject">Strategic alliances</field><field name="subject">Network</field><field name="subject">Tourism marketing</field><field name="subject">Inter-organisational cooperation</field><field name="subject">Case study methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gendered embodiment and critical tourism - exploring Italian women's sensuality</field><field name="creator">Abramovici, Martine</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of Italian women&#8217;s sensual embodiment in leisure and tourism experiences (involving beautifying in the city and tanning at the beach) in, and around, the city of Rome. The central link in this thesis connects the field of tourism studies with social cultural theories of the &#8216;body&#8217;, placing this research within the most recent theoretical debates on the body. It is argued that in everyday life people take their bodies for granted, yet the body is absolutely crucial to the way we engage with the world and the people around us. Through analysing Italian women&#8217;s embodiment, this thesis seeks to gain in-depth understanding of Italian society and more particularly women&#8217;s position in society, thereby positioning the field of tourism studies as a means for analysing people&#8217;s quotidian cultural habits. Embracing the critical paradigm, this thesis takes a reflexive and embodied approach to research, challenging the all-pervasive hegemonic dominance of positivist, masculinist Western academic approaches. Through post feminist lenses, auto ethnography, in-depth interviewing and document analysis were used to carry out the field work, with the central aim of capturing and contextualising Italian women&#8217;s voices and embodiment. This research shows Italian society to be strongly patriarchal, reflecting gender inequity and inequality. Women are dominated in discourse (politics, senior management and television shows being predominantly male), pressured into family roles, and objectified in society through the media and the male gaze. Paradoxically, women are empowered through choosing to reproduce patriarchal values of beauty and objectification (the power of the agency), and to embody these in a sensual and sensuous way, thereby reversing power relations in their favour. Aiming to understand Italian society through exploring women&#8217;s sensual embodiment, this thesis contributes to a broader understanding of the gendered construction of social identity, and of patriarchy and power relations, from a woman&#8217;s perspective. It contributes to gender and body studies in the tourism field through bringing these separate fields together, through exploring the power of agency in embodiment, and through the critical research approach to the body.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Critical tourism</field><field name="subject">Reflexivity</field><field name="subject">Embodiment</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Patriarchy</field><field name="subject">Tanning</field><field name="subject">Italy</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/465</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information technology audit: systems alignment and effectiveness measures</field><field name="creator">Nicho, Mathew</field><field name="description">Information technology audit has proven to be a relatively new, less researched and rapidly expanding field among large, medium and even small businesses (commercial and non-commercial organisations). The implementation rate has grown rapidly and presents a huge growth market for audit consultants due to the need for transparency and compliance with regulation (for example: Sarbanes Oxley Act) and the need to be competitive in the marketplace. The audit process is being conducted mainly by consultants following a traditional process but using different proprietary approaches and mostly done manually. The purpose of this study is to present a scientific method to attach a purely measurement focus to the auditing process so as to provide an auditing as well as a quantitative outcome of the performance to the various IS entities that are audited using a novel automated method that can save organisations considerable resources in terms of time, cost and effort. The nature of the topic directed the researcher to three domains of information system (IS) namely studies on IS measurement, IT governance and software engineering. These areas provided information on the nature of IS measurement and the models used; the process of auditing/measurement and the corresponding frameworks used; the principles and methodology of measurement of IS entities; and measurement models used both in the software engineering and information systems domain. The review of the literature gave rise to the research question and the COBIT-GQM (Control Objectives for Information Technology Audit) &#8211; Goal Question Metrics) model. The research question that had emerged out of the four propositions &#8220;How can an IT audit or governance framework be used to measure the effectiveness of IS entities in a scientific manner using customised and goal oriented metrics&#8221; along with the nature of data sought (positivist), guided the researcher to qualitative research using multiple case studies to test the theoretical model (grounded theory) that had emerged out of the literature review. The theoretical model was automated (with a front end interface and a back-end database) and initially tested for usability issues. Then the common COBIT control objective that was obtained through an initial survey was entered into the database along with a set of questions and metrics (developed by the researcher by following the given GQM guidelines). This application that was demonstrated, and given for evaluation in four organisations gave rise to expected and surprising results. While the respondents expressed their desire to incorporate a customised and goal oriented measurement perspective to their IT audit/performance  functions, that would save them time, effort and cost, numerous suggestions were provided that need to be incorporated into the model to make it fully functional. Notable among them are the need to embed a multiple contextual qualifying layer, incorporating benchmarking feature to the model, and the need to link this with the maturity model. These were incorporated into the model and a comprehensive model incorporating all the suggestions was created. The qualitative case study method being used here more to evaluate a theory, provided a sound base for future studies to generate hypothesis that can be evaluated using quantitative survey methods for the model to be generalised. IT auditing being a relatively new, less researched, conventional and high growth oriented field, the use of an innovative, comprehensive, automated and scientific method of audit and measurement method will satisfy the implied need for organisations to incorporate the diverse audit/measurement/ control/standards into one comprehensive method and this research is a major step in this direction. Since the new model is comprehensive and can be automated organisations can economise in terms of time, cost and effort. Irrespective of the nature of economic cycle the need for economising in terms of cost, time and effort is universal for all organisations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information technology governance</field><field name="subject">Information technology audit and control</field><field name="subject">Goal Question Metrics method</field><field name="subject">Information technology alignment</field><field name="subject">Information systems measurement</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research in information systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the development of a Creativity Support Tool for advertising</field><field name="creator">Opas, Tommi</field><field name="description">In recent years, there has been a strong interest in developing Creativity Support Tools for many exciting areas of research such as art and music. Yet few such tools have been developed to support creativity in advertising. This is unusual since advertising, like art and music, is a highly creative endeavour of the human mind. The goal of advertising is to transform a communicational objective of a product or a service into a creative idea. A tool that would enhance the development of creative ideas in advertising would be highly beneficial for the advertising industry and possibly shed light on the mystery behind creativity. In this thesis, I developed Creative Pad, a new Creativity Support Tool to assist advertising creative in generating creative ideas for advertising. In developing Creative Pad, I studied advertising creativity and human creative thinking. I developed a framework for analysing the advertising process, in which the process is viewed as having three distinct phases: a message, an idea, and an execution. A significant implication of this view is that the process for developing ideas for new advertisements and the process of executing those ideas and turning them into creative products are independent. Each step is the result of a significant creative process. Creative Pad is developed to assist in the development of creative ideas for new advertisements. To assist this creativity, relevant triggers are needed. Research has shown that individuals with high associative skills produce more creative advertising. Creative Pad supports the associative skills of the advertising creative and exploits the use of the Internet as a dynamic database. It finds words and sentences related to the original communicational objective, providing relevant triggers for the associative creative process in the minds of the advertising creative. Several experiments using Creative Pad were conducted with advertising creative and students with no advertising background. The results show that Creative Pad supports the generation of new ideas in two ways. First, and most important, all the subjects were able to develop interesting new ideas. In particular, the advertising creative were able to design a sketch of the advertisement from ideas generated using Creative Pad. Second, I was able to find a connection between the triggers, the words and sentences selected by the user during the creative process, and the ideas generated. Although the connection might be considered a weak one, it nonetheless demonstrates that a connection exists between the ideas developed by the advertising creative and those suggested by Creative Pad.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creativity support tool</field><field name="subject">Advertising</field><field name="subject">Artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Creativity</field><field name="subject">Idea generation</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Web 2.0</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The H-bug epidemic: the impact of antibiotic-resistant staphylococcal infection on New Zealand society and health 1955-1963</field><field name="creator">Jowitt, Deborah Mary</field><field name="description">An epidemic of staphylococcal infections occurred in New Zealand hospitals and communities from 1955-1963. The 'H', or 'Hospital Bug', a strain of Staphylococcus aureus characteristic of the epidemic, was resistant to the most commonly used antibiotics. Post-operative patients, the frail elderly and mothers and babies were particularly vulnerable to staphylococcal colonization and infection. This thesis places the H-Bug epidemic in its historical context, discussing the ways in which the government and health professionals responded to the rising incidence of staphylococcal infection, and the major effects of the epidemic on medical and hospital practice. It also examines the impact of persistent staphylococcal infection on women and families in the community. Primary sources provided the basis for this thesis. The H-Bug epidemic has gone largely unrecorded except in contemporary documents. Health Department files and Auckland Hospital Board records as well as newspaper clippings were important sources. The New Zealand epidemic was clearly linked to the global pandemic of antibiotic resistant staphylococcal infection, 1946-1966, through medical literature and archival documents. International medical journals, including the New Zealand Medical Journal, published numerous articles on the epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant staphylococcal infection, providing an excellent record of research, case studies, current opinion, and recommended practice. The most valuable contribution to an understanding of the impact and experience of the H-Bug epidemic was, however, provided by the nineteen people who agreed to be interviewed for the study. Interviewees included a wide variety of health professionals and women and their children, all of whom had personal experience or association with the epidemic. In this thesis it is argued that the main focus of the medical response was the prevention and control of hospital cross-infection, both to protect patients and to preserve the public perception of the hospital as a safe venue for care. Although the emergence of resistant strains of staphylococci was widely attributed to the misuse of antibiotics, this thesis contends that the Health Department was reluctant to impose restrictions on medical prescribing and that Health Department official and senior clinicians chose instead to modify hospital environments and clinical practice. Rooming-in was widely introduced to counter the epidemic despite the fact that a trial in 1959, at National Women's Hospital, did not demonstrate a reduction in infection rates among neonates. The concept endured, however, as it held strong appeal for hospital administrators hard pressed to keep wards adequately staffed with trained personnel. It was also supported by women and health professionals who were convinced of the benefits of a close mother-baby relationship from birth. The H-Bug epidemic was eventually resolved by the introduction of the methicillin antibiotics in the early 1960s. As a consequence, confidence in a pharmaceutical solution to infectious disease remained intact until the emergence of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms in the 1980s. The lessons of the H-Bug epidemic had been largely forgotten in the intervening years, ignored until New Zealand clinicians were reminded once again that antimicrobial resistance would inevitably accompany the indiscriminate use of antibiotics and inadequate attention to infection prevention and control.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug resistance in microorganisms</field><field name="subject">Antibiotics</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Hospitals</field><field name="subject">Safety measures</field><field name="subject">Maternal health services</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/21</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GIS model for assessment of land use and urban development effects on stormwater runoff: Puhinui Catchment case study</field><field name="creator">Krpo, Ana</field><field name="description">As local authorities are becoming more interested in the assessment of pollutant loads, this study offers a Geographic Information System (GIS) model for assessing nonpoint source of pollution for two scenarios: the current and ultimate stage of urbanization. The Puhinui Catchment, Manukau City, has been used as a case study in developing and testing this model. This catchment has all the attributes of a "typical" urban area and gives a good representation of the effects of land use on the receiving waters of Puhinui Stream and its estuary. Annual mass contaminant loadings were calculated by firstly assessing the physical characteristics of the Puhinui catchment (case study catchment) and secondly describing the nature of storm water quality and calculating the annual mass contaminant loadings.GIS is used to multiply the annual runoff volume by a mean pollutant concentration to acquire an average annual pollutant load. The annual runoff volume is calculated from the drainage area, runoff coefficient and annual rainfall. To calculate the total mean pollutant load, the pollutant loads for all land use types within the catchment are summed and the process is applied for each pollutant. This GIS model determines the connection of typical pollutant concentrations with land uses in the catchment and offers a characterisation of nonpoint source pollution in that catchment. This model can be used for, identifying catchment areas that contribute considerably to the pollution of waterways, determining the appropriate treatment of the storm water runoff for particular sub catchment, storm water quality improvement prioritization and cost-benefit analysis, selecting locations for water-quality monitoring stations, improvement in maintenance practices, assessment of proposed development environmental effects.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geographic information systems</field><field name="subject">Urban runoff</field><field name="subject">Storm sewers</field><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="subject">Pollution</field><field name="subject">Enviornmental studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/180</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Graphic film: a new genre of moving image</field><field name="creator">Sheffield, Adam T</field><field name="description">Over the past three years I have engaged in a search for a form of moving image that would serve as a medium to contain, express and communicate my concerns and ideas. My initial investigations led me to motion graphics but as my understanding of moving image broadened I came to the conclusion that the models I was examining did not fit this genre, they are something new and do not have a definition.  There are conflicting ideas about what the term motion graphics means. For the purpose of clarity, I adopted Matt Frantz's definition as a start point: "designed, non-narrative, non-figurative based visuals that change over time." Motion graphics is often considered a component of a larger moving image work or a filler element between two larger works. For example, the opening moments of a film or television programme, or a swirling abstract that forms a background for an interstitial between programmes. I require a description of a moving image type of that can be used as a guide to making work. Research into the field of moving image work made by designers was conducted with grounded theory employed as the principle methodology. This research has revealed a moving image type that I refer to as "graphic film". During the past year I have identified its key characteristics. I have explored and tested the boundaries of this new genre by constructing graphic film and comparing it to previously defined forms of moving image. The outcome of this project is a comprehensive description of what graphic film is and its ten primary characteristics. This project can serve as a guide for other graphic designers who wish to make work of this type.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motion graphics</field><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">Film</field><field name="subject">Construction deconstruction</field><field name="subject">Planar space</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hyphenated living: between longing and belonging, an exposition of displacement as liminality in the transnational condition</field><field name="creator">van Dyk, Yoka A J</field><field name="description">This thesis explores a complex concept of home with respect to issues of belonging and displacement from both a personal and transnational1 perspective, which deals with the here in New Zealand and there in the Netherlands. Through the visual and the poetic, in printmaking, book art, digital photography and installation--drawing on auto-biographical experiences of migration, as well as contextual research--I have been investigating the concept of "home" as a hyphen. This hyphen motif aptly performs the migrant condition of between here and there, a liminal space of betweenness and transition, where internal and external worlds, here and there, past and present, intersect. This intersection point, marked by hyphenation, always performs across multiple borders and thereby emphasises a spatial-temporal liminal register experienced by many transnational. In textual practice a hyphen is a punctuation sign that connects and separates two different entities. As such, here the hyphen begins to evoke an interesting spatial-temporal paradigm for transnational, who are placed between two or more divided geographies, sociographies and cultural identities. As well as being a link between multiple series of dual entities and conditions, the hyphen can simultaneously signify an ambiguous area of liminality--a psychological space of neither here nor there, an undecidability of identity and belonging, which, on various levels, is symptomatic for many transnational. This project explores how this hyphenated position influences a sense of identity and belonging and its relation to our postmodern world.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Modern art</field><field name="subject">Netherlands</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Immigration</field><field name="subject">Emigration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Http://www.100types.com: developing a computer-mediated model for the teaching of type design history</field><field name="creator">Archer, Ben</field><field name="description">This project's purpose is to relocate traditional paper-based library content about typographic history to a website, curated as a digital museum. The project process is defined as three distinct parts: 1. Scholarship and research. 2. Model-building and website creation. 3. Deployment, testing and evaluation. To support this, the project included the following sub stages: An informal needs analysis generated by reflection on practice. A survey of contemporary typeface classification systems, type education literature and online resources for typographic study. The building of animated and three-dimensional prototype models. The creation of a database of 100 historically significant typeface designs. The sourcing of samples, references, images and the gathering of reproduction permissions from designers, institutions and foundries whose work features in the database. The writing, editing, design and launch of the website at http://www.100types.com Peer feedback and review. An evaluation study of the website with students at AUT University in Auckland, New Zealand. A series of revisions to the website structure and presentation. The writing up of the research process and findings. I chose this topic as the direct result of my experiences teaching typography at AUT University and other tertiary institutions. The need for graphic design students to demonstrate competencies in typography (as a sub-discipline of graphic design) has always been present, but has been fore grounded over the last two decades; however, a recent PhD thesis on the subject has argued that traditional delivery of print-based typographic knowledge no longer serves undergraduate requirements for today's divergent screen-based media (Yee, 2006, p.11). This has been accompanied by a significant rise in the number of available typefaces (Cahalan, 2004, p.62). Unfortunately the means with which to study them has not kept pace with these developments (Dixon, 2002, p.4).Changes occurring within the type manufacturing industry and the wider field of creative industries during the last two decades have made the historical, background context of typography harder to comprehend from an undergraduate point of view. Students complain that they are under-resourced for information (in their preferred research medium) about the typefaces they must demonstrate care and deliberation in choosing. From experience gained in observing an online-learning pilot scheme in 2005, I elected to develop an online reference resource designed for self-directed research of typographic history as a complement to the existing tuition of typographic applications face-to-face in the classroom. While the project offers a useful example of how practice-led research can augment a teaching situation, and is concerned with the promotion of student-centred and self-directed learning at AUT University, this is not its only objective as a public-access location on the internet. In keeping with the rising philosophy of open content for web-based education resources, a conscious decision was made at the project's inception to host and present the website independently of AUT University and its online learning environment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Typeface design history</field><field name="subject">History of printing</field><field name="subject">Typographic history research project</field><field name="subject">Curriculum action research</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The forgotten feminine</field><field name="creator">Sleeman, Lauren</field><field name="description">The topic of my research is the lived experiences of eight psychotherapists and counsellors who consciously work with unusual phenomena as it arises in the therapeutic encounter. Unusual phenomena in this thesis refers to felt experiences which are considered to be beyond the everyday in the Cartesian paradigm and are often referred to as spiritual and/or mystical phenomena. Exploring these phenomena brings to light the potentialities in the vastness of consciousness which is considered to be an integral aspect of human existence in the thesis. I chose Heidegger&#8217;s hermeneutic phenomenological methodology for the research because it gives credence to the many and varied possibilities and potentialities both in particular lived experiences and in human existence as a whole. Van Manen&#8217;s lived existential provides the framework in which the participants&#8217; experiences are explored. What emerged from the research is that unusual phenomena are not unusual for the participants. Although such phenomena are less visible and therefore less familiar in the everyday world, they are recognizable through their consistent presentation. This includes the participants having a powerful sense of &#8216;knowing&#8217; which is all-encompassing and is beyond familiar landmarks such as the linear models of time and space. The participants bring their &#8216;knowing&#8217; into the everyday world through embodiment and through their acknowledgment of the interconnectedness of existence. The expression of interconnectedness is experienced by the participants as lovingness, from which the ability for immediate healing in their therapeutic work becomes apparent.

By exploring the performativity of an object (and questioning how an object performs in relation to the body), the documented performances activate an inter-relational act between artist and object (I perform the object, the object performs me simultaneously). The work that unfolds from this investigation considers the placement of the viewer&#8217;s body in relation to the artist&#8217;s. A dialogue is formed between the three bodies: object, artist and viewer, creating a sense of embodiment within the work through this relationship. in|form explores this embodiment through the role of video documentation. The performances are constructed to be viewed solely through the documentation, which creates a discussion between the &#8216;live&#8217; moment and the documented event, and how the viewer then relates to this. The performances take place as solo acts, but are constructed with the viewer in mind. As the viewer watches the documented performance of the action between artist and object in space, the relational nature of the work creates a second performance which embodies the viewer. This sole action, recorded and then viewed, considers the relational value of the body, specifically engaging with the abstraction of bodily formlessness within the object to reveal a bodily nature. Using the object to trace the movement of the body creates a language that communicates to, and about, both viewer and artist: through the awareness of passing time, through the large scale projection of the documentation, through the bodily nature of the object, and through the performativity of the object&#8217;s responsive nature to the artist&#8217;s body as the pair navigate through space. in|form explores how the absence of the body (in a literal sense) considers the body as an object bound by time, at once physical yet transient. By tracing the motion of the body through object, the viewer experiences the body through sensibility. Ultimately, the function of the body negotiating as a time-bound object is imitated through the performativity of the object with artist, and the elusiveness of this action emphasized by its documentation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Body as object</field><field name="subject">Measuring movement</field><field name="subject">Video performative document</field><field name="subject">Sculptural performance</field><field name="subject">Absence of body</field><field name="subject">Duration of time</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immobilisation of metal in quartz sands by ball milling</field><field name="creator">Zhang, ZhengXi</field><field name="description">Previous work has shown that when inorganic compounds are milled with quartz in a high energy ball mill the elements are sequestered into the quartz matrix and cannot be easily recovered by simple extraction methods.  In this study lead (II) oxide, copper (II) oxide, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide and sodium hydroxide were milled with quartz sand and the recoveries of the metals investigated in detail. The standard EPA3050B method (acid digestion of sediments, sludge and soils) for extractable metals was compared to exhaustive HF digestion method based on ASTM C146-94a (test methods for chemical analysis of glass sand) and UDC 666.123:543.06 (chemical analysis of soda-lime and borosilicate glass).  From these two analyses the total recovery of metals was determined. It was found that the elements extracted by the EPA3050B method decreased in an approximately logarithmic way with milling time. The metals are apparently strongly sequestered into the fractured quartz. Total HF digestion of the insoluble matrix gave good recovery of the &#8220;lost&#8221; elements.  A reliable analytical procedure has been developed and the mechanisms leading to this sequestering are discussed. Particle size analysis and electron microscopy of milled samples support a process of brittle alloy formation as the proposed mechanism whereby the elements are sequestered into the milled quartz.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanochemistry</field><field name="subject">Mechanochemical synthesis</field><field name="subject">Ball milling</field><field name="subject">Reaction milling</field><field name="subject">Reactive milling</field><field name="subject">Heavy metal</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/458</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrative methods for gene data analysis and knowledge discovery on the case study of KEDRI&#8217;s brain gene ontology</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yuepeng</field><field name="description">In 2003, Pomeroy et al. published a research study that described a gene expression based prediction of central nervous system embryonal tumour (CNS) outcome. Over a half of decade, many models and approaches have been developed based on experimental data consisting of 99 samples with 7,129 genes. The way, how meaningful knowledge from these models can be extracted, and how this knowledge for further research is still a hot topic. This thesis addresses this and has developed an information method that includes modelling of interactive patterns, important genes discovery and visualisation of the obtained knowledge. The major goal of this thesis is to discover important genes responsible for CNS tumour and import these genes into a well structured knowledge framework system, called Brain-Gene-Ontology. In this thesis, we take the first step towards finding the most accurate model for analysing the CNS tumour by offering a comparative study of global, local and personalised modelling. Five traditional modelling approaches and a new personalised method &#8211; WWKNN (weighted distance, weighted variables K-nearest neighbours) &#8211; are investigated. To increase the classification accuracy and one-vs.-all based signal to- noise ratio is also developed for pre-processing experimental data. For the knowledge discovery, CNS-based ontology system is developed. Through ontology analysis, 21 discriminate genes are found to be relevant for different CNS tumour classes, medulloblastoma tumour subclass and medulloblastoma treatment outcome. All the findings in this thesis contribute for expanding the information space of the BGO framework.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Modeling experiment</field><field name="subject">Microarray</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/467</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of cultural context on corporate web sites: a New Zealand and South Korean comparison</field><field name="creator">Choi, Mun Ga</field><field name="description">This study examines the impact of national culture on the content of corporate Web sites, and Web users&#8217; attitudes and intentions toward culturally congruent or incongruent Web sites. In this work, culturally bipolar clusters based on Hofstede&#8217;s (1991) and Hall&#8217;s (1976) cultural dimensions are conceptualised. New Zealand and Korea are chosen as representatives of the respective bipolar clusters. This research utilises both content analysis and experimental research to provide deep insight into an area which has not yet been explored. Two studies are undertaken, Study One, focusing on the content analysis, examines how the use of visual communication and Web features differs between the two countries and between industry types. Study Two assesses Web users&#8217; predispositions to respond favourably or unfavourably to the Web site. Web users&#8217; perceptions, measured by experimental research with four culturally manipulated Web sites, are assumed to be the most suitable concept for studying the effectiveness of Web sites. Three ethnic groups are involved: Korean university students, New Zealand university students, and English-Korean bilingual university students. The findings reveal differences in the content of corporate Web sites from the two countries. However, these results do not support the findings of extant research. The results show that the corporate Web sites studied can be distinguished not only by the two national cultures, but also by other significant factors such as a company&#8217;s characteristics, its online presence strategy, national broadband infrastructure, and unique Internet culture. Additionally, the segment of young adults shows a convergence of cultural value systems which can be attributed to the fact that young adults in both countries have similar perceptions toward corporate Web sites regardless of their nationalities. Language structure and local terminology on the Web sites, however, are still important. This study contributes to knowledge by providing critical insights into the effectiveness and cultural congruence of Web sites. The results will benefit both academics and practitioners.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cultural adaptation</field><field name="subject">Attitude</field><field name="subject">Future intention</field><field name="subject">Industry effects</field><field name="subject">Web site effectiveness</field><field name="subject">Content analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A generic platform for the evolution of hardware</field><field name="creator">Bedi, Abhishek</field><field name="description">Evolvable Hardware is a technique derived from evolutionary computation applied to a hardware design. The term evolutionary computation involves similar steps as involved in the human evolution. It has been given names in accordance with the electronic technology like, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Evolutionary Strategy (ES) and Genetic Programming (GP). In evolutionary computing, a configured bit is considered as a human chromosome for a genetic algorithm, which has to be downloaded into hardware. Early evolvable hardware experiments were conducted in simulation and the only elite chromosome was downloaded to the hardware, which was labelled as Extrinsic Hardware. With the invent of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Reconfigurable Processing Units (RPUs), it is now possible for the implementation solutions to be fast enough to evaluate a real hardware circuit within an evolutionary computation framework; this is called an Intrinsic Evolvable Hardware. This research has been taken in continuation with project 'Evolvable Hardware' done at Manukau Institute of Technology (MIT). The project was able to manually evolve two simple electronic circuits of NAND and NOR gates in simulation. In relation to the project done at MIT this research focuses on the following: To automate the simulation by using In Circuit Debugging Emulators (IDEs), and to develop a strategy of configuring hardware like an FPGA without the use of their company supplied in circuit debugging emulators, so that the evolution of an intrinsic evolvable hardware could be controlled, and is hardware independent. As mentioned, the research conducted here was able to develop an evolvable hardware friendly Generic Structure which could be used for the development of evolvable hardware. The structure developed was hardware independent and was able to run on various FPGA hardware&#8217;s for the purpose of intrinsic evolution. The structure developed used few configuration bits as compared to current evolvable hardware designs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evolutionary computing</field><field name="subject">Genetic algorithm code</field><field name="subject">Genetic programming</field><field name="subject">EHW</field><field name="subject">Artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The current situation Chinese third-party logistics companies are facing - an exploratory study : 112.889 (120 credits) thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science (MApplSc) in Logistics and Supply Chain Management at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Liu, Yongli</field><field name="description">The fast development of the Chinese economy has brought tremendous impact on the growth of logistics industry in the country. China has become the hottest market for both Chinese and foreign third-party logistics companies (3PL providers), and more and more foreign and domestic 3PL providers are being involved in the Chinese logistics industry. To understand the current situation Chinese third-party logistics companies are facing and the competitive strategies they are pursuing, an exploratory investigation was conducted in the study. A multiple case-study approach was adopted as the main strategy and guidance for the study. Under the principle of multiple case studies, multiple instruments (questionnaire, telephone interviews and archive searching) were used in the data collection among three selected case study companies. Also, within-case analysis and cross-case analysis were chosen as the overall framework of data analysis, and content analysis was selected as the main method for qualitative data analysis. Through investigating a variety of aspects of the three case study 3PL companies, the study has identified that all the case study companies have established country-wide logistics networks, have provided customers a range of logistics services, and have adopted different information technology systems in their operations. All the case study companies have achieved constant increase in their sales in recent years. Generally, the competition in the Chinese 3PL industry is fierce, and sometimes chaotic, unfair, and even illegal. Foreign 3PL providers have been considered as major competitor by Chinese 3PL providers. All the case study companies have developed and pursued a number of competitive strategies to gain competitive advantages in both cost and service. The main competitive strategies addressed include distribution network developing strategy, information technological strategy, and long-term partnership strategy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="subject">logistics networks</field><field name="subject">business competition</field><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/969</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The association of homeotic gene expression with stem cell formation and morphogenesis in cultured medicago truncatula</field><field name="creator">Chen, Shih-kuang</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">somatic embryogenesis</field><field name="subject">Medicago truncatula</field><field name="subject">WUSCHEL</field><field name="subject">2HA</field><field name="subject">WOX5</field><field name="subject">CLV3</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/37580</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetric and imperfect knowledge: a proposal to replace unbounded rationality with bounded rationality</field><field name="creator">Cao, Cung, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to illustrate how the role of knowledge may be the missing link in economics and to argue that the assumption of unbounded rationality, which underpinned neoclassical economics, should be replaced by bounded rationality and that bounded rationality should be redefined as people are rational, but are constrained by asymmetric and imperfect knowledge. This decomposition of bounded rationality makes it possible for us to operationalize bounded rationality, which was founded by Herbert Simon in the 1950s, but has not been widely adopted in economics because the concept was considered too difficult to formalize. The inclusion of asymmetric and imperfect knowledge considerations in microeconomics provides new insights into the existence and boundaries of firms, the role and nature of institutions, financial market inefficiency and political choices. The inclusion of asymmetric knowledge considerations in macroeconomics can help explain the unequal distribution of wealth between individuals, firms and nations. A lack of knowledge, and the difficulties in overcoming a lack of knowledge, can help to explain aspects of economic fluctuations, prices rigidities, monetary non-neutrality and unemployment. Most importantly, when the role of knowledge is considered, it provides better explanations to various anomalies in economics, helps reconciles differences between various theories and may opens up the possibility of unifying various schools of economic thought.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making.</field><field name="subject">Rational choice theory.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The educational leader as counsellor implications for selection, appraisal and professional development for school leaders</field><field name="creator">Yeung, Nancy Tsui Yee, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study examined the literature on leadership and counselling to determine their similarities, and investigated how principals perceived their leadership role in terms of the theories of counselling and contemporary leadership. It further explored the implications of the findings for the selection, performance appraisal and professional development of principals. The research was divided into four stages. Firstly, the literature of effective counsellors and educational leaders was reviewed to find their significant similarities. Secondly, 116 principals from Government and Catholic primary, secondary and special schools in Sydney, NSW, Australia were involved in a Q-sort survey to prioritise what they deemed to be the essential emphases of effective educational leaders in schools. Analysis was by descriptive quantitative methods to provide a basis for subsequent interviews and qualitative analysis. Thirdly, structured interviews were carried out with thirteen of these principals to cast further light on the Q-sort survey results. Qualitative analysis was largely based on Bohm???s interpretation of Strauss???s axial coding paradigm. Fourthly, content analysis was carried out on formal documents of the NSW Department of School Education and the Catholic School System of the Sydney Diocese to determine the degree of congruence between selection criteria, criteria for performance appraisal and components of professional development programs for principals and the emphases in the literature and the responses of principals in this study. Contemporary literature on both leadership and counselling emphasised the importance of the leader???s/counsellor???s authenticity, empathy, respect, and effective communication skills. Principals prioritised these counselling-related attributes after a focus on students and strategic leadership but ahead of organisation, resource management, evaluating and controlling. Some ranking differences by gender, years of experience, type of school and school system were noted and discussed. Document analysis revealed that the criteria by which principals are selected, appraised and professionally developed do not include an emphasis on the counselling-related attributes which is commensurate with the importance afforded these attributes both in contemporary leadership theory and from the principals??? own view of their role. Implications of these findings for theory, practice and further research were explored and recorded.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational leadership</field><field name="subject">Educational counseling</field><field name="subject">School principals</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical simulation of fracture in plain and fibre-reinforced concrete</field><field name="creator">Bui, Thanh Tien, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Localised failure in quasibrittle materials is due mainly to the effects of combined shear and compression. Once the cohesion strength is reached, shear tractions generate slip and aggregate interlocking that cause dilatancy inducing crack opening. Further damage reduces the cohesion and dilatancy so that eventually only a residual friction state remains. The energy dissipated due to friction and interlocking needs to be considered in the constitutive law. Initially, a Mohr-Coulomb yield surface with a tension cut-off will be investigated. A compression cap will be included when the modelled interfaces are not appropriately aligned and compressive failure must be controlled. The evolution of the yield surface and the appropriate flow rules to be used in the interface/particle model, are questions which will be examined. The particle/interface model with plasticity concentrated at the interface nodes, which can produce the correct volumetric expansion, will also be studied. A composite model has been developed to represent the heterogeneity of concrete consisting of coarse aggregates, mortar matrix and the mortar-aggregate interface. The constituents of concrete are modelled using triangular elements with six interface nodes along their sides. Fracture is captured through a constitutive softening-fracture law at the interface nodes, which bound the elastic domain inside each element. The inelastic displacement at an interface node represents the crack opening, which is associated to the conjugate internodal force by a single branch softening law. The path-dependent softening behaviour is derived in irreversible rate formulation within a quasi-prescribed displacement control. At each event in the loading history, all equilibrium solutions for the prescribed mesh can be obtained and the critical equilibrium path with the minimum increment of external work adopted. The crack profile develops restrictively to the interface boundaries of the defined mesh. No re-meshing is carried out. Solutions to the irreversible rate formulation are obtained using a mathematical programming procedure in the form of a linear complementary problem. Other work is aimed at incorporating fibre reinforcement in the model. Fibre particles are modelled by introducing additional linear elements interconnecting distant interface nodes in the matrix media after the generation of matrix-aggregate structure.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Concrete.</field><field name="subject">Fracture mechanics -- Computer simulation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of fluid film forces in circumferential groove fed journal bearings</field><field name="creator">Pham, Anh Duc, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis evaluates the application of Reynolds equation in calculating fluid film forces (FFFs) in circumferential groove journal bearings (CGJBs) with both balanced and unbalanced rotors. The existing rig was fabricated at UNSW for that purpose. Unfortunately the rig was unsuitable because it was unstable at speeds as low as 500 rpm. This occurred because, when designing the rig, the traditional ??-film cavitation boundary model (CBM) was used. Consequently a modified cavitation boundary model (MCBM) was proposed which correctly predicted the instability threshold of the rig. Using the MCBM, new bearings were installed and the modified rig was stable in the required speed range up to 2400 rpm. Two existing computer programs to calculate bearing stiffness and damping coefficients and FFFs were modified for the purposes of this study. In addition, only dynamic components (AC components) of experimental FFFs could be measured accurately. The vertical mean value (DC component) of experimental FFF was approximated to the vertical reaction force and the horizontal DC component of experimental FFF was approximated to zero at each bearing. This thesis concludes that the numerical solution of Reynolds equation to calculate DC components of FFFs in a CGJB is valid with a proper selection of CBM. The agreement of AC components of the FFFs were good with a balanced rotor, but were poor with an unbalanced rotor. The modified CBM is more accurate than the existing ??-film CBMs. The cavity region is important to obtain accurate numerical results and depends on test conditions, bearing dimensions, etc. To design for critical speeds, cavitation pressure could be either oil vapour pressure or atmospheric pressure; however, to design for stability, cavitation pressure should be oil vapour pressure, or even much lower. Two halves of a CGJB carried different loads because of misalignment and different clearances. In addition, reducing length and increasing clearance significantly increased the stability of the rig. Finally, to obtain perfect agreement between numerical and experimental FFFs, short bearings and a smaller clearance ratio are strongly recommended. A special design to measure cavitation pressure is suggested.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fluid-film bearings -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Cavitation.</field><field name="subject">Rotors -- Bearings.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural and functional effects on large artery stiffness: an in-vivo experimental investigation.</field><field name="creator">Butlin, Mark, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Large artery stiffness is predictive of adverse cardiovascular events and all cause mortality. Artery structure and function are determinants of artery stiffness. This thesis presents a series of in-vivo experimental studies of effect of structural and functional changes on large artery stiffness. Improved analysis methods were developed for measurement of arterial stiffness indexes, Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) and pressure wave re ection. These were applied in studies of acute in ammation, active and passive changes in systemic pressures, aortic elastic laminae defects, and aortic calcification in rats using a novel, high fidelity, dual pressure sensing technique of measuring aortic rat PWV. Findings indicated that acute in ammation does not increase large artery stiffness, and that localised effects altering arterial structure do not manifest in in-vivo changes in large artery stiffness. The functional component of stiffness was investigated using graded systemic infusion of vasoconstrictor agents (angiotensin-II, noradrenaline, and Endothelin-1 (ET-1)) in the in-vivo ovine iliac artery. There was a markedly greater dose dependency of pressure independent change in PWV (angiotensin-II) compared to direct endothelial effects (ET-1), although blocking of ET-1 receptors produced marked changes in iliac blood ow. A similar experiment in the human iliac artery found that the B-antagonist and nitric oxide (NO) donor, x Structural and functional effects on large artery stiffness nebivolol, potentially causes a decrease in regional functional stiffness. An additional study in human subjects directly measured the decrease in forearm arterial stiffness during reactive hyperaemia following different periods of ischaemia. The findings precluded the use of this method in measuring brachial artery structural stiffness with maximal smooth muscle relaxation. Increasing periods of ischaemia had a bi-phasic relationship with changes in arterial stiffness, the first phase linked to endogenous nitric oxide release. This finding is of importance in the clinical quantification of endothelial dysfunction. These findings in basic research of arterial haemodynamics provide new quantitative contributions to the in-vivo experimental investigation of the aetiology of large artery stiffness related to structure and function of endothelial and medial wall properties. This can lead to potential clinical applications and techniques for assessment of cardiovascular risk.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system.</field><field name="subject">Arteries -- Diseases.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Security market design &amp; execution cost.</field><field name="creator">Cook, Rowan M, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">We employ the Reuters database to compare execution costs for 2,330 matched-pair securities across the top 7 equity markets in the Dow Jones STOXX Global 1800 Index. This sample encompasses a wide variety of thirteen market design features. In addition, we investigate execution costs well beyond the most heavily traded stocks to include equities in the sixth through tenth deciles of traded value. Our findings indicate that full transparency of the limit order book to investors and a composite of unique NYSE features (but not the presence of the crowd) unequivocally reduce effective spreads. In contrast, a fully transparent limit order book revealed to brokers, the presence of a market maker, or the mixture of execution systems present on the LSE sharply increase effective spreads in both thickly and thinly-traded stocks. The effect of a physical trading floor is statistically significant but relatively small; it increases effective spreads slightly for thickly-traded firms, and reduces them for thinly-traded stocks. The findings for price impact are the same with three exceptions. First, the presence of a trading floor increases costs, dramatically so for thinlytraded stocks. Second, a fully transparent limit order book for brokers raises price impact for thickly traded stocks, but lowers price impacts for thinly traded firms. Third, in thinly-traded stocks, London???s hybrid market decreases price impact, and in thickly-traded stocks, crowd trading on the NYSE and full transparency to investors decrease price impact. Finally, the results for realised spread are essentially the same as those for effective spread, with the exception that the effect of the presence of a trading floor is to reduce realised spreads. Overall, the London Stock Exchange is the highest execution cost market, and the NYSE is the lowest. This research includes a market-specific study of the effect on execution cost of the Liquidity Provider of Euronext Paris. Euronext Paris affords a natural experimental research design because a third of firms have Liquidity Providers and two thirds do not. Results indicate quoted spreads, effective spreads and realized spreads are significantly affected by the presence of a Liquidity Provider, but price impacts are not. On the one hand, this suggests that the thickly-traded stocks where the Liquidity Providers are prohibited have sufficient liquidity in their absence. On the other hand however, liquidity providers on Euronext Paris reduce effective and realised spreads in essentially all stocks. This finding suggests that the limit order book refreshes much more quickly after developing an imbalance of large size orders when Liquidity Providers can facilitate other liquidity suppliers in assessing picking off risk. The Liquidity Provider increases quoted spreads for thickly-traded firms from the first three traded value deciles while reducing quoted spreads for the lower deciles.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cost.</field><field name="subject">Stock exchange.</field><field name="subject">Markets.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31457</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reliable key-based routing topologies.</field><field name="creator">Risson, John, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Key-based routing enables massive, networked systems to direct messages to a node responsible for a resource and its key. Our thesis is that key-based routing (KBR) is a reliable primitive for large Internet services. Four issues are addressed. Firstly, most KBR schemes do not support strong routing consistency: routing is consistent when one and only one node delivers messages for a given key to the application layer. Inconsistent routing can cause application-layer performance problems and faults. The faulttolerant active rings (ftar) algorithm of this dissertation is unique in that it is fault-tolerant and it guarantees strong routing consistency: other algorithms either support probabilistic routing consistency or are not fault-tolerant. Routing tables are updated only after a joining or leaving node and its two immediate neighbors agree to the topology change. We formally specify, refine and prove the algorithm using the B Method. Secondly, algorithms are required to maintain one-hop KBR topologies reliably. One-hop topologies can give lower message latency and loss than topologies with small routing tables. Existing one-hop topologies with full routing tables have expensive repair mechanisms or critical points of failure. To avoid these problems, we contribute anti-entropy multicast (aecast), a reliable multicasting algorithm for one-hop topology maintenance. Aecast is compared with another epidemic multicasting algorithm, pbcast, by analysis and simulation; aecast gives at least fivefold fewer out-of-date nodes on average within one round of a topology update; faster updates improve routing performance. Thirdly, accurate analysis of lazy replica repair algorithms is required. Whereas the above algorithms maintain the topology, replication algorithms maintain data stored on the topology. One algorithm lazily repairs replicas when there is a membership timeout for failed nodes; the analysis ignored replica repair times and therefore overestimates availability. The Markov analysis here is more accurate. Fourthly, hierarchic topologies are reliable in that they protect the local topology from remote failures and network partitions; in existing designs, topology changes burden the top of the hierarchy. We devise a hierarchic architecture that avoids this problem.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Topology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31890</field></doc><doc><field name="title">State housing at Orakei and the model suburb experiment in New Zealand 1900-1940.</field><field name="creator">van Raat, Anthony Christian, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">The colonization of New Zealand led to the development of particular patterns of settlement. In some cases models were derived from contemporary British practice; in other cases they came from new world settlements elsewhere. But almost invariably any theoretical propositions which might have either consciously or unconsciously underpinned the form of the settlements and their ideological or other purposes were displaced by the pragmatic beliefs and constraints of those who developed them. These settlements arose at the same time as the belief that New Zealand was a natural paradise and that it offered the opportunity for the establishment of some kind of new and perhaps even utopian model for settlement. The Auckland suburb of Orakei as it developed in the first decades of the twentieth century provides fertile ground for the exploration of a number of themes which illuminate the New Zealand suburban experience: the role of the state in regulating and providing housing; the development of the discipline of planning; the evolution of the garden suburb in New Zealand; the choice of an architectural style for state housing; the integration of planning and housing; the contest for physical and ideological control of development; and the decisive role of individuals in creating the suburb. This thesis describes the political, social and ideological environments which led to the construction of the suburb of Orakei and the form which it took.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Housing.</field><field name="subject">Social settlements.</field><field name="subject">New Zealand -- History.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cell cycle control by ID1 and WT1 in breast cancer cells.</field><field name="creator">Caldon, Catherine Elizabeth, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Loss of proliferative control is a cornerstone of cancer development, induced by deregulation of mitogenic signalling, insensitivity to anti-proliferative signals and direct changes in cell cycle proteins. In breast cancer these alterations are frequently targeted through cyclins D1 and E, leading to defects in G1/S transition. I have investigated the role of two potential pro-proliferative oncogenes in breast cancer, id1 andwt1. Each protein promotes proliferation in distinct contexts, with unique consquences for breast cancer cells. Using a 3D culture model of non-transformed mammary epithelial cells, I identified that id1 undergoes downregulation via rapid proteosomal degradation and cytoplasmic relocalisation during mammary epithelial morphogenesis. Overexpression of Id1 led to an increase in acinar size via an increase in S phase, and wa dependent on the presence of an intact HLH domain in Id1. Co-expression with the proto-oncogene Bcl2 led to a more disorganised acinar structure, indicating that Id1 overexpression primed the cells for further oncogenic insult. Further, Id1 overexpression was unable to increase acinar size in cyclin D1-/- acini, indicating that Id1 is dependent on cyclin D1 for its proliferative effects. Overall these data identified Id1 as capable of altering the proliferation of normal mammary epithelial cells, a crucial step in early breast carcinogenesis. Wt1 was originally identified as a tumour suppressor, but our data lends support to Wt1 acting as an oncogene in breast cancer. Wt1 is expressed highly in a range of breast cancer cell lines, and is strongly regulated by progestins. Using siRNA, we identified that Wt1 is likely to be a molecular intermediary of progestin as the downregulation of Wt1 mimics a subset of progestin effects on cell proliferation and lipid synthesis. Conversely, the overexpression of the major Wt1 isoform, Wt1 (+/+), led to attenuation of progestin-induced differentiation and growth arrest via maintenance of cyclin D1 levels. The effects of Wt1 overexpression were specific to progestins, and did not affect the actions of anti-estrogens or androgens. Consequently the overexpression of Wt1 (+/+) may disrupt the endocrine response in mammary epithelial cells, and contribute to excess proliferation and failure to differentiate during breast oncogenesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cell cycle.</field><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33125</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An integrated framework for managing eBusiness collaborative projects</field><field name="creator">Cameron, Julie, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Project management -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Organization -- Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Energy-aware synthesis for networks on chip architectures</field><field name="creator">Chan, Jeremy, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Network on Chip (NoC) paradigm was introduced as a scalable communication infrastructure for future System-on-Chip applications. Designing application specific customized communication architectures is critical for obtaining low power, high performance solutions. Two significant design automation problems are the creation of an optimized configuration, given application requirement the implementation of this on-chip network. Automating the design of on-chip networks requires models for estimating area and energy, algorithms to effectively explore the design space and network component libraries and tools to generate the hardware description. Chip architects are faced with managing a wide range of customization options for individual components, routers and topology. As energy is of paramount importance, the effectiveness of any custom NoC generation approach lies in the availability of good energy models to effectively explore the design space. This thesis describes a complete NoC synthesis ???ow, called NoCGEN, for creating energy-efficient custom NoC architectures. Three major automation problems are addressed: custom topology generation, energy modeling and generation. An iterative algorithm is proposed to generate application specific point-to-point and packet-switched networks. The algorithm explores the design space for efficient topologies using characterized models and a system-level ???oorplanner for evaluating placement and wire-energy. Prior to our contribution, building an energy model required careful analysis of transistor or gate implementations. To alleviate the burden, an automated linear regression-based methodology is proposed to rapidly extract energy models for many router designs. The resulting models are cycle accurate with low-complexity and found to be within 10% of gate-level energy simulations, and execute several orders of magnitude faster than gate-level simulations. A hardware description of the custom topology is generated using a parameterizable library and custom HDL generator. Fully reusable and scalable network components (switches, crossbars, arbiters, routing algorithms) are described using a template approach and are used to compose arbitrary topologies. A methodology for building and composing routers and topologies using a template engine is described. The entire flow is implemented as several demonstrable extensible tools with powerful visualization functionality. Several experiments are performed to demonstrate the design space exploration capabilities and compare it against a competing min-cut topology generation algorithm.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Networks on a chip.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">???The monsters next door???: representations of whiteness and monstrosity in contemporary culture</field><field name="creator">Tyrrell, Kimberley, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The focus of this thesis is the examination of whiteness as a dominant identity and subject position.  Whiteness has conventionally assumed a normative, monolithic status as the template of humanity.  Recent theorising has attempted to specify and denaturalise whiteness.  In order to participate in this fracturing of whiteness, I analyse examples in which it functions as a site of contested and ambiguous contradiction.  To this end, I use contemporary monstrosity to examine whiteness.  Monstrosity is a malleable and culturally specific category of difference that measures alterity, and by displaying discursive functions in an extreme form offers insight into the ways in which deviance and normativity operate.  I argue that the conjunction of whiteness and monstrosity, through displaying whiteness in a negative register, depicts some of the discursive operations that enable whiteness to attain such hegemonic dominance.  I deploy theories of marginalisation and subjectivation drawn from a variety of feminist, critical race, and philosophical perspectives in order to further an understanding of the discursive operations of hegemonic and normative subject positions. I offer a brief history and overview of both the history and prior conceptualisations of monstrosity and whiteness, and then focus on two particular examples of contemporary white monstrosity.  I closely examine the representation of monstrosity in serial killer films.  The figure of the serial killer is typically a white, heterosexual, middle class male whose monstrosity is implicitly reliant upon these elements.  In my discussion of the recent phenomenon of fatal shootings at high schools in North America, I investigate the way the massacre at Columbine High School functions as the public face of the phenomenon and for the unique interest it generated in the mass media.  I focus on a Time magazine cover that featured a photograph of the adolescent perpetrators under the heading The Monsters Next Door, which condensed and emblematised the tension that they generated.  It is through the perpetrators uneasy occupation of dual subject positions???namely the unassuming all American boy and the contemporary face of evil???that their simultaneous representation as average and alien undermines the notion of whiteness as neutral and invisible.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Monsters in literature.</field><field name="subject">Horror films -- History and criticism.</field><field name="subject">Serial murderers.</field><field name="subject">whites.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Appendicitis protects against colitis: an exploration of underlying immune mechanisms</field><field name="creator">Ng, Wa Sang Watson, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Inflammatory bowel disease-(IBD) is a chronic relapsing and remitting disorder of the gastrointestinal tract characterised by inflammation. The underlying immunopathogenesis is unknown but excessive effector and defective regulatory immune responses play a significant role. The aetiology of IBD is not yet fully resolved, but interactions between genetic and environmental factors, including the gut flora, contribute significantly to the development of IBD. Appendicectomy for intra-abdominal inflammatory conditions before the age of 20 protects against colitis. The mechanism underlying this protective effect is unclear. This thesis examined the hypothesis that appendiceal regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) mediate the protection. Despite human and murine data showing that the appendix is involved in the prevention of colitis, few studies of human or murine appendices have been reported. A novel murine model of appendicitis was created using an operative technique of band-ligation of an induced-tubular-appendix. Histological assessment showed that this model recapitulated all of the histological features of human acute appendicitis, namely mucosal ulceration, transmural neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltration and serositis. This local pathology was associated with a systemic host response, evidenced by raised serum Creactive- protein. The impact of inflammation on the appendiceal lymphocyte constituents was assessed by flow cytometry. The inflammation caused a shift from B-lymphocyte to T-lymphocyte predominance. In particular there was a 75% increment in Treg numbers, which was restricted to juvenile mice only (&amp;lt 10 weeks old). Furthermore, appendiceal Treg expressed the gut-homing chemokine-receptor, CCR9, and the intestine-specific integrin, &#945;4&#946;7. These cells were shown to preferentially migrate to the colonic lamina propria. Lastly, appendicitis and appendicectomy protected against TNBS-colitis which was also restricted to juvenile mice. Evidence for antigen dependence was suggested by the effect being heightened when mice were pre-sensitised against TNBS. Exploration of the colonic lamina propria (cLP) lymphocyte population showed an increase in Treg, especially CD8+Foxp3+- Treg, in ??protected?? mice only, which may have originated in the appendix. Intracytoplasmic cytokine detection showed that these cLP-Treg were potent producers of the regulatory cytokine, IL-10. These findings strongly suggest that appendicitis triggers an expansion of Treg which then emigrate to the colon and mediate long-lasting protection against colitis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Appendicitis</field><field name="subject">Colitis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sex-dependent ageing and reproductive effort in the Australian black field cricket (Teleogryllus commodus)</field><field name="creator">Zajitschek, Felix , Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Evolutionary theories of ageing and senescence provide a framework that allows to understand why apparently maladaptive senescent phenotypes are observed under natural conditions, despite the fact that natural selection should, at first sight, be opposed to mechanisms that lead to the deterioration of bodily functions with advancing age. While ageing has been shown in the wild and has been explored under artificial laboratory conditions, sex-dependent pattern were not considered in detail. The aim of this thesis is to draw from the existing theories of sexual selection, life-history and sexual conflict, to get a more complete understanding of sex-specific effects on ageing patterns. 	The organism I use in all experiments is the Black Field Cricket Teleogryllus commodus. To test for sex-specific demographic ageing patterns in the wild, I use a capture-mark-recapture study and analyse the resulting data with a new method that combines classic capture-recapture models with a recent mathematical technique that allows to estimate survival probabilities from recapture data for which the date of births of animals are unknown (Chapter 2). I test for reproductive and demographic ageing under near-natural conditions in field enclosure (Chapter 3). In laboratory based manipulation studies I estimate the effect of a) different juvenile and adult diets on the ageing patterns (Chapter 4), and b) a reduction of the ability to spend energy on calling and how this relates to lifespan (Chapter 5). In a half-sib breeding design I measure early and late reproductive effort in males  and in females to estimate genetic correlations and thereby test for antagonistic pleiotropy between early and late components and between males and females. The studies in the wild indicate that Teleogryllus commodus senesce under natural conditions and that males have overall higher mortality rates.  Females, not males, show reproductive ageing under both enclosure and laboratory conditions. The genetic architecture revealed no discord between male and female fitness components and there was no evidence for antagonistic pleiotropy between early and late fitness components. These results show that a) it is important to include male measures of reproductive effort in ageing studies and that b) the field of ageing research should benefit a lot from incorporating sexual selection, life-history and sexual conflict theory.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aging.</field><field name="subject">sex.</field><field name="subject">Physical anthropology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Troubling spaces: The politics of ???New??? community-based guerrilla performance in Australia</field><field name="creator">Caines, Rebecca , English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the politics of twenty-first century ???guerrilla??? performance. It historicises site-specific, political performance by examining ???guerrilla??? art forms from the 1960s to the present. It argues that recent community-based, site-specific performance events can be seen as a ???new??? type of guerrilla work, as they utilise techniques which challenge public space, authorship and control without resorting to traditional guerrilla forms of didactic street protest.  The author establishes two main political tactics of the community-based guerrilla artist. The first is the utilisation of a problematised definition of ???community??? and the second is an understanding of physical, conceptual and experiential ???space??? as open to intervention. Community-based performance and site-specific art practices are investigated and space and community are placed into critical theoretical frameworks using post-structural and spatiality theory. The author then argues that post-structured communities which are based on an ethics of difference can trouble and create site, conceptual space and place (site/concept/place) through contemporary guerrilla performance events.  Three examples of community-based guerrilla performance in Australia are examined. The first case study explores Western Sydney based Urban Theatre Projects and their 1997 performance event TrackWork. The second focuses on community-based hip-hop artist Morganics and his facilitation of two hip-hop tracks Down River and The Block in 2001. The third considers US theatre director Peter Sellars??? problematic curation of the 2002 Adelaide Festival of the Arts. In all three case studies, guerrilla artists are shown working with post-structured communities to challenge and trouble site/concept/place in order to improve the lives of their participants and audiences. This thesis proposes new post-structural frameworks for the powerful presence of community and site in performance events, thus contributing to performance and cultural studies and to the emerging field of community-based performance scholarship.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Performance.</field><field name="subject">Artists and community -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/36750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aluminium smelting cell control and optimisation</field><field name="creator">Iffert, Martin , Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The ideal aluminium smelting cell should operate at a fixed temperature and superheat. However, spatial and temporal operating strategies cause changes in temperature, which usually result in variations in superheat as well. Contrasting, in the long term, for mature cells the aluminium fluoride consumption is fairly accurately reflected by the soda and calcium oxide contents of the primary alumina. Therefore the poor control of aluminium fluoride concentration reflects the poor understanding of the causes of variation in aluminium fluoride concentration and molten bath mass within the cell. The aims of this thesis were to i.	Develop a better understanding of how the dynamics of the aluminium smelting process impact process conditions ??? hence bath chemistry ii.	Subsequently develop and evaluate diagnostic models that may be used to minimise the variations in chemistry in individual operating cells The key control feature to minimise adverse effects is Superheat. The ideal aluminium smelting cell should operate at a fixed temperature and superheat. However, spatial and temporal operating strategies cause changes in temperature, which usually result in variations in superheat as well. In this thesis industrial aluminium reduction cells and their material handling and dry scrubbing operation were analysed in respect to their energy and material balance. A number of experiments were carried out to study the influence of process parameters and operations on the state and path function of a cell. Bath inventory measurements lead to a better understanding of the underlying process behaviour, and it was obvious that energy and mass balance cannot be controlled independently. With regard to the response of bath inventory, bath and liquidus temperature to pot operation, the following interesting phenomena were identified: -	some cells are active or inactive with respect to their response to aluminium fluoride additions -	positive and negative voltage steps cause non-proportional changes in liquidus and bath temperatures -	the liquidus temperature, bath volume and composition can respond rapidly to changes due to alumina feeding Successful application of the results and understanding developed in this research resulted in an energy requirement reduction of 1 kWh/kg</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aluminium smelting.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Limiting programs for induction in artificial intelligence</field><field name="creator">Caldon, Patrick , Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines a novel induction-based framework for logic programming. Limiting programs are logic programs distinguished by two features, in general they contain an infinite data stream over which induction will be performed, and in general it is not possible for a system to know when a solution for any program is correct. These facts are characteristic of some problems involving induction in artificial intelligence, and several problems in knowledge representation and logic programming have exactly these properties. This thesis presents a specification language for problems with an inductive nature, limiting programs, and a resolution based system, limiting resolution, for solving these problems. This framework has properties which guarantee that the system will converge upon a particular answer in the limit. Solutions to problems which have such an inductive property by nature can be implemented using the language, and solved with the solver. For instance, many classification problems are inductive by nature. Some generalized planning problems also have the inductive property. For a class of generalized planning problems, we show that identifying a collection of domains where a plan reaches a goal is equivalent to producing a plan. This thesis gives examples of both. Limiting resolution works by a generate-and-test strategy, creating a potential solution and iteratively looking for a contradiction with the growing stream of data provided. Limiting resolution can be implemented by modifying conventional PROLOG technology. The generateand- test strategy has some inherent inefficiencies. Two improvements have arisen from this work; the first is a tabling strategy which records previously failed attempts to produce a solution and thereby avoids redundant test steps. The second is based on the heuristic observation that for some problems the size of the test step is proportional to the closeness of the generated potential-solution to the real solution, in a suitable metric. The observation can be used to improve the performance of limiting resolution. Thus this thesis describes, from theoretical foundations to implementation, a coherent methodology for incorporating induction into existing general A.I. programming techniques, along with examples of how to perform such tasks.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Artificial Intelligence.</field><field name="subject">Logic programming.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modulation of arterial stiffness by angiotensin receptors and nitric oxide in the insulin resistance syndrome</field><field name="creator">Brillante, Divina Graciela, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The insulin resistance syndrome [INSR] is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and affects up to 25% of the Australian population. The mechanism underlying the relationship between the INSR and increased cardiovascular risk is controversial. We postulated that perturbations in the renin-angiotensin system [RAS] and endothelium-derived NO may be implicated in the development of early vascular changes in the INSR.  Repeated measurements of arterial stiffness [using digital photoplethysmography] and haemodynamic parameters in response to vasoactive medications were used to demonstrate the functional expression of angiotensin II [Ang II] receptors and NO synthase [NOS].  Ang II acts via two main receptor sub-types: the Ang II type 1 [AT1] and Ang II type 2 [AT2] receptors. The AT1 receptor is central to the development of arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction. The role of AT2 receptors in humans is controversial but is postulated to counter-act AT1 receptor mediated effects in diseased vascular beds. We demonstrated increased AT1 and AT2 receptor-mediated effects in small to medium-sized arteries of subjects with early INSR [Chapter 6].  In addition, functional expression of AT2 receptors in adult insulin resistant humans [Chapter 5], but not in healthy volunteers [Chapter 4] was demonstrated. AT1 receptor blockade in subjects with early INSR resulted in improvements in vascular function, with a consequent functional down-regulation of AT2 receptors [Chapter 7].  Functional NOS expression was demonstrated to be increased in subjects with early INSR compared with healthy controls [Chapter 6]. This was postulated to be a homeostatic response to counteract early vascular changes in subjects with early INSR. AT1 receptor blockade in these subjects reduced functional NOS expression [Chapter 8].  In conclusion, patients with early INSR represent a model of early disease where early intervention may be able to reverse the process incited by the initial exposure to multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Early vascular changes in these individuals are mediated at least in part, by increased AT1 receptor activity and/or expression, and may be detected by changes in arterial stiffness indices and non-invasive vascular reactivity studies. There is a compensatory increase in AT2 receptor and NOS expression/activity to counter-act these vascular changes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arterial stiffness.</field><field name="subject">Insulin resistance syndrome.</field><field name="subject">Metabolic syndrome.</field><field name="subject">Nitric oxide.</field><field name="subject">Angiotensin receptors.</field><field name="subject">AT1 receptor.</field><field name="subject">AT2 receptor.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nonlinear dynamic analysis of reinforced concrete frames under extreme loadings</field><field name="creator">Vali Pour Goudarzi, Hamid Reza, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research focuses on improvements and application of 1D finite elements for nonlinear dynamic analysis of reinforced concrete frames under extreme loadings. The concept of force interpolation is adopted for the element formulation and a solution scheme developed based on a total secant stiffness approach that provides good convergence characteristics. The geometrical nonlinearities including 2nd order P-Delta effects as well as catenary action are considered in the element formulation. It is shown that geometrical nonlinearities may have a significant effect on member (structure) response within extreme loading scenarios.  In the analysis of structures subjected to extreme loadings, accurately modelling of the post peak response is vital and, in this respect, the objectivity of the solution with softening must be maintained. The softening of concrete under compression is taken into account, and the objectivity preserved, by adopting a nonlocal damage model for the compressive concrete. The capability of nonlocal flexibility-based formulation for capturing the post-peak response of reinforced concrete beam-columns is demonstrated by numerical examples.  The 1D frame element model is extended for the modelling of 3D framed structures using a simplified torque-twist model that is developed to take account of interaction between normal and tangential forces at the section level. This simplified model can capture the variation of element torsional stiffness due to presence of axial force, bending moment and shear and is efficient and is shown to provide a reasonable degree of accuracy for the analysis of 3D reinforced concrete frames.  The formulations and solution algorithms developed are tested for static and dynamic analysis of reinforced concrete framed structures with examples on impact analysis of beams, dynamic analysis of frames and progressive collapse assessment of frames taken from the literature. The verification shows that the formulation is very efficient and is capable of modelling of large scale framed structures, under extreme loads, quickly and with accuracy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Progressive collapse.</field><field name="subject">Nonlinear finite element.</field><field name="subject">Dynamic analysis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic testing in the age of anxiety. From rhetoric to narrative.</field><field name="creator">Leontini, Rose, School of Sociology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The debate on genetic testing for Huntington???s disease has been dominated heavily by the bioethical and biomedical discourses. Yet upon analysis, both discourses are highly inadequate for understanding the complexity of the difficult choices people are faced with, and the inter-personal relations that are central to decisions regarding the uptake of genetic tests. The purpose of this thesis is two-fold. Firstly, to conduct a theoretically-informed critical analysis of the existing bioethical discourse on genetic testing for Huntington???s disease, that draws primarily on the work of contemporary feminist thinkers. Secondly, to explore how people with a genetic risk for Huntington???s disease negotiate the available choices between certainty and uncertainty; how they experience the liminality of ???being at risk??? in everyday life; how they manage their social environments; and how they interpret their own situation. The matter of ???choice??? is heightened because of the ready availability of genetic testing for Huntington???s disease, and the moral rhetoric that accompanies the provision of genetic services. Empirically, the research draws on the narratives by eleven people with a family history of Huntington???s disease, through which they discuss their fears of living in the shadow of the fatal disease, and consider their choices on reproduction and genetic testing. Their narratives will be analysed through the work of Foucault and Goffman, as well as a wide range of contemporary sociologists.The thesis being proposed is that decisions on genetic testing cannot be said to be ???individual???, but are instead dispersed among the social relations between the self and others, reflecting and transforming the values, competing desires, and the discourses that are prevalent in their social worlds. This is achieved through the discursive production of a web of narratives through which both individuals and institutions attempt to govern, with varying degrees of success, the implications of this relatively new field of knowledge.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Huntington's chorea -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Chemistry of Cycloaurated Complexes</field><field name="creator">Kilpin, Kelly Joan</field><field name="description">New cycloaurated complexes have been synthesised and characterised. The biological and catalytic activity (in the addition of 2-methylfuran to methyl vinyl ketone) of selected complexes was evaluated. New complexes reported in this thesis where fully characterised by NMR (&#185;H, &#185;&#179;C and &#179;&#185;P when appropriate) and IR spectroscopy, ESI-mass spectrometry and elemental analysis.  The simple cycloaurated iminophosphoranes (2-AuCl&#8322;C&#8326;H&#8324;)Ph&#8322;P=N-R (R = (R,S)-CHMePh, (S)-CHMePh, p-C&#8326;H&#8324;F or But) were synthesised by the reaction of the appropriate ortho-mercurated compound with [Me&#8324;N][AuCl&#8324;] and [Me&#8324;N]Cl in acetonitrile; the complex (2-AuCl&#8322;C&#8326;H&#8324;)Ph&#8322;P=N-(S)-CHMePh was structurally characterised. The cis chloride ligands on the complexes were replaced by chelating dianionic ligands such as thiosalicylate and catecholate - the resulting bis-metallacyclic complexes have a better anti-tumour activity (against P388 murine leukemia cells) than the parent dichlorides. The nitrogen-gold coordinate bond is relatively robust and is not cleaved by cyanide or dithiocarbamate ligands. The reaction of (2-AuCl&#8322;C&#8326;H&#8324;)Ph&#8322;P=N-Ph with PPh&#8323; results in substitution of the chloride ligand trans to the nitrogen (shown by an X-ray crystal structure). Both the endo ((2-AuCl&#8322;C&#8326;H&#8324;)Ph&#8322;P=NC(O)Ph) and exo ((2-AuCl&#8322;C&#8326;H&#8324;)C(O)N=PPh&#8323;) cycloaurated isomers of the stabilised iminophosphorane Ph&#8323;P=NC(O)Ph were synthesised and structurally characterised.  Cycloaurated Ph&#8323;P=S and Ph&#8323;P=Se were synthesised by a transmetallation reaction from 2-Hg[(C&#8326;H&#8324;)P(E)Ph&#8322;]&#8322; (E = S or Se). The synthesis of cycloaurated Ph&#8323;P=O by an analogous method was unsuccessful. PhP(S)(NEt&#8322;)&#8322; was also cycloaurated via a transmetallation reaction. X-ray crystallography confirmed the sulfur (not the nitrogen) was coordinated to the gold centre. The complexes show a similar stability and reactivity to the C,N cycloaurated species - the cis chloride ligands can be replaced by the chelating thiosalicylate ligand. Again the bis-metallacyclic species showed better biological activity than the parent dichloride. The direct reaction of the 2-pyridyl sulfonamide ligands 2-(C&#8325;H&#8325;N)CH&#8322;NHSO&#8322;R (R = p-tolyl, Ph or Me), 2-(C&#8325;H&#8325;N)CH&#8322;CH&#8322;NHSO&#8322;R (R = p-tolyl or Ph) or 8-(p-tosylamino)quinoline with refluxing aqueous H[AuCl&#8324;] gave N,N' coordinated complexes containing a five- or six-membered cycloaurated ring. The cycloaurated complexes derived from the ligands 2-(C&#8325;H&#8325;N)CH&#8322;NHSO&#8322;Me and 8-(p-tosylamino)quinoline were structurally characterised. The cycloaurated N,N' systems were not as stable as the C,N systems - reaction with reducing agents led to reduction of Au(III) to Au(I) and elemental gold. The 2-pyridine thiocarboxamide ligands 2-(C&#8325;H&#8325;N)C(S)NHR (R= p-tolyl, CH&#8322;Ph, Me, p-C&#8326;H&#8325;OMe) also underwent direct cycloauration upon reaction with H[AuCl&#8324;]. Coordination via the pyridyl nitrogen and sulfur atom was confirmed by an X-ray crystal structure of cycloaurated 2-(C&#8325;H&#8325;N)C(S)NHCH&#8322;Ph. The N,S cycloaurated systems show poor stability in solution and decompose relatively quickly so applications are limited. The ligand with a 2 pyridyl substituent reacted with H[AuCl&#8324;] in a different manner. Instead of cycloauration, the ligand was oxidised and an internal cyclisation occurred to give a 1,2,4-thiadiazolo[2,3-a]pyridinium heterocyclic ring. The reaction of the cycloaurated dichloride complexes (2-benzylpyridine)AuCl&#8322; and (2-AuCl&#8322;C&#8326;H&#8324;)Ph&#8322;P=N-Ph with the tripodal Kl&#228;ui ligands (Na[(C&#8325;H&#8325;)Co{P(O)R&#8322;}&#8323;], R = OMe or OEt) and Tl[BF&#8324;] resulted in the formation of cationic gold(III) salts. In the solid state the Kl&#228;ui ligand is strongly coordinated through two of the three oxygen atoms, and weakly by the third, giving the gold a distorted square pyramidal geometry. In solution there is rapid interchange between the coordinated and non-coordinated oxygen atoms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gold</field><field name="subject">cycloaurated complexes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide in the Glowworm Cave, Waitomo</field><field name="creator">Miedema, Natalie Margaret</field><field name="description">The Waitomo Caves attract approximately 500 000 tourists each year. A requirement of tourist cave management is that the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO&#8322;) is kept below levels that are: hazardous to the health of visitors, hazardous to the glowworms and other natural inhabitants, or potentially corrosive to speleothems. For the Glowworm Cave at Waitomo, the maximum permissible PCO&#8322; level is 2400 ppm. When exceeded, the tourist operators are required to close the cave. Ten years of monitoring data at the Glowworm Cave was analysed. Most of the variation in PCO&#8322; could be attributed to CO&#8322; respired by tourists, and the mixing of cave air with lower PCO&#8322; outside air. Occasionally, there were periods with high PCO&#8322; levels while the cave was closed to tourists. The main objective of this study was to investigate the potential role of the Waitomo Stream in contributing CO&#8322; to the Glowworm Cave atmosphere. Analysis of ten years of Glowworm Cave monitoring data showed that the 2400 ppm PCO&#8322; limit was, on average, exceeded five times each year, with a total of 48 events between 1998 and 2007. Of the PCO&#8322; limit exceedences, approximately 31% of events were largely driven by high tourist numbers; 27% of PCO&#8322; limit exceedences were mainly driven by increased discharge, rainfall, and/or a low temperature gradient between the cave and outside air, whilst 29% of the PCO&#8322; limit exceedences were due to a combination of tourists and increased discharge, rainfall, and/or a low temperature gradient. The remaining 13% of exceedences were unexplained by tourists or the factors investigated. It may be that the unexplained exceedences were due to the night time closure of the cave door, restricting air exchange. The PCO&#8322; of the Waitomo Stream was measured by equilibrating air with the streamwater within a closed loop. The air was passed continuously through an infrared gas analyser (IRGA). The streamwater PCO&#8322; typically ranged between 600 - 1200 ppm. Fluctuations in the PCO&#8322; of the Waitomo Stream coincided with PCO&#8322; fluctuations in the Glowworm Cave air, and under most conditions, the stream probably acted as a sink for cave air CO&#8322;. However, following rainfall events, the stream PCO&#8322; increased, exceeding cave air PCO&#8322;, thus acting as a source of CO&#8322; to the cave air. High stream PCO&#8322; often occurred at times when air flow through the cave was restricted, e.g. when the temperature gradient between the cave air and outside air was low, or stream levels were high, thus limiting air movement. The combination of high stream PCO&#8322; and a low temperature gradient increased the likelihood of high cave air PCO&#8322;. Dripwater was measured to determine whether an increase in dripwater PCO&#8322; occurred in response to rainfall events. When rainfall events resulted in increased discharge, the dripwater PCO&#8322; sometimes increased (occasionally exceeding 5000 ppm), however the pattern was not consistent. The chemistry of the Waitomo and Okohua (Ruakuri) Streams was monitored with daily samples collected and analysed for major ions: HCO&#8323; -, Ca&#178;&#8314;, Na&#8314; and Mg&#178;&#8314;, and &#948;&#185;&#179;C stable isotope. The HCO&#8323; -, Ca&#178;&#8314;, Na&#8314; and Mg&#178;&#8314; concentrations in the streamwater decreased with increased discharge, presumably due to dilution. Increased discharge following rainfall events correlated with increasing PCO&#8322; in the Waitomo Stream, suggesting that soil atmosphere CO&#8322; dissolved in soil waters, and carried to the stream by saturated flow, was responsible for the streamwater PCO&#8322; increase. Ca in the stream showed both an increase and a decrease with respect to rainfall. Increased Ca in the stream occurred at times when the discharged waters were coming from the phreatic zone, and thus sufficient time had lapsed for CO&#8322; in the discharge waters to react with the limestone (carbonate dissolution reaction). Decreased Ca occurred when the infiltration and percolation of rainwater was rapid, and thus the streamwater was characterised by a higher PCO&#8322; and a lower Ca concentration, as insufficient time had lapsed for the discharge waters to equilibrate with the limestone. Increased negativity in the &#948;&#185;&#179;C of the Waitomo and Ruakuri Streams coincided with increased discharge. During summer low flow, the &#948;&#185;&#179;C of Waitomo Stream waters was -11.3&#8240;, whereas during high stream discharge events, the &#948;&#185;&#179;C dropped to -12 - -14&#8240;. The &#948;&#185;&#179;C of limestone is 0&#8240;, the atmosphere is -7&#8240;, and the soil atmosphere is reported to be about -24&#8240;, thus the decrease in &#948;&#185;&#179;C during high flow events supports the contention that soil atmosphere CO&#8322; is a likely source of the increased CO&#8322; in flood waters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">carbon dioxide</field><field name="subject">karst</field><field name="subject">cave</field><field name="subject">Glowworm Cave</field><field name="subject">Waitomo Stream</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2781</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influences of Motivational Orientation on Academic Achievement within the Context of Lower and Upper Primary Year Levels</field><field name="creator">Hamilton, Peta</field><field name="description">Many researchers have completed a range of studies to evaluate the relationship of intrinsic, extrinsic and amotivation, particularly on how it influences on a student's academic achievement. This study expanded on these studies by examining the relationship of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation within the context of lower and upper primary school classrooms. One issue that has received minimal attention is the relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and academic achievement in young students. In order to examine this relationship, students completed a motivation questionnaire (Academic Motivation Scale), as well as a Standardised Academic Test (State-wide Government Year 3 &amp; 7 Tests). Correlational analysis identified the relationship between these constructs and was used to examine the connection between students' gender and motivational orientation. It was hypothesised that students operating from the intrinsic motivation perspective, are more likely to be high achievers within their year level. It was furthermore hypothesised that students in the lower year level would show higher levels of intrinsic motivation and as students progressed through primary school intrinsic motivation levels would decline while extrinsic motivation would increase. The results of this research study concluded that high academic achievers operated with high levels of both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The study also discovered that there is a decline in both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation as students progre&#167;s through their primary education.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motivation</field><field name="subject">Academic achievement</field><field name="subject">Primary education</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp207.11082009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Reflection in Leading the Professional Development of the Advanced Skills Teacher</field><field name="creator">Hanifin, Pamela Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis critiques the role that reflection plays in leading teacher professional development. It critically explores the reflective processes that five Advanced Skills Teachers use to create meaning for their practice and to direct their professional learning. The research inquired into how this activity has contributed to their ongoing professional growth by connecting important learning events of the past, to decisions made and action taken when dealing with current problematic curriculum issues. This is relevant as the research was set within Brisbane Catholic Education during a time of system initiated curriculum reform. The theoretical framework for the research was primarily underpinned by critical social theory. It was also guided by an interpretative philosophy, In order to give some consideration to the personal dimension of experience. A case study approach was adopted as it promoted collaborative inquiry. This offered scope and flexibility to extrapolate and to critically explore the embedded values and thinking that underscored the teachers' decisions and actions. Most data were collected through a number of ongoing semistructured and open-ended interviews. The emergent design for the research allowed for systematic, yet flexible and ongoing data collection, analysis and participant feedback. Other supporting data included folio documentation, artefacts, an inquiry project summary sheet and a research diary. The research concluded that reflection plays an important role in enabling teachers to accept moral and professional responsibility for their own personal and professional development. However, this research has attested that there is no single model of what it means to be a reflective practitioner. Reflective practice and teacher professional development are highly idiosyncratic, complex and multi-dimensional phenomena that are clearly influenced by the interplay of a wide range of personal and contextual factors. The research revealed that teachers utilise a variety of reflective forms and processes, through various modes, to serve context specific interests. It also concluded that it was the teacher's explicit awareness of the critical intent behind thinking and subsequent action that appeared to be important to professional growth. This intent was consistently framed around each teacher's moral commitment of care and responsibility to the students as persons and learners. It became the most salient impetus behind professional deliberations and generative efforts to improve practice. Emotion tended to playa powerful, mediating role in this process. Moreover, reflection on the cognitive, affective and social dimensions of knowledge appeared to enable the teachers to consider the values&#8226; and ideals that underscored decisions and subsequent actions. The research concluded that reflection involves highly interactive cognitive and sensory processes that enable the teacher to connect with the self, with the students and with others in and beyond the school community. Reflective activity also seemed to enable the teachers to consider the consequences of dealing or not dealing with system initiated curriculum reforms, from the perspective of the students' best interests. The research revealed how the current emphasis on curriculum reform has influenced efforts to create a more holistic curriculum that gives attention to the person of the student. The modelling of reflective processes and the negotiation of aspects of the curriculum with the students provided worthwhile opportunities for these teachers, as well as their students, to articulate assumptions that underscored decisions and actions. The engagement in introspective self-dialogue, social reflection and reflective collaboration with peers and students appeared to enhance personal and professional development. This research also concluded that&#8226; administrative recognition and tangible support at the personal, school and system level provided conditions that were conducive to ongoing teacher renewal and development.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reflection</field><field name="subject">Professional development</field><field name="subject">Advanced skills teachers</field><field name="subject">Catholic education</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp208.12082009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-stakeholder organising for sustainability</field><field name="creator">Sharma, Aarti</field><field name="description">Multi-stakeholder dialogue and collaborations have been considered as &#8216;panacea&#8217; for complex local to global problems confronting governments, businesses and society. And for over a decade now, they have also been increasingly promoted as mechanisms to achieve sustainability. There is, however, a dearth of empirical studies that give deeper insights into the practical dimensions and various implications of such processes for sustainability. This dissertation explores how multi-stakeholder organising processes for sustainability occur in local settings. It relies on a theoretical framework that combines institutional and social movements theoretical perspectives. Such a theoretical cross-fertilisation has been helpful in explaining: (a) how the macro institutional context of sustainable development influences micro interactions of individuals during collaborations; and (b) how those micro interactions may influence the sustainability movement organised at macro societal levels. The dissertation is philosophically based on the principles of critical hermeneutics. It draws on the works of Hans-Georg Gadamer and J&#252;rgen Habermas to understand the nature of reality, society and human relationships. The study also uses literature on sustainable development, organising, dialogue, collaboration, stakeholder engagement, emotions and time. Three cases of multi-stakeholder dialogic collaborations organised to address sustainability of two regions in New Zealand were investigated through observations, interviews with participants and documentary research. These processes were developed in response to a regulatory change in New Zealand &#8211; the new Local Government Act (2002) which emphasises sustainable development of communities. The data across the three cases was analysed using principles of grounded theory and critical hermeneutics. Analysis reveals how various kinds of institutional pressures (engulfing cultural-cognitive, regulative and normative institutions connected with sustainable development) confront different stakeholders with varying intensities. Those pressures influence stakeholders to become involved in and commit to such collaborations. And as stakeholders participate in such processes, they are shown to engage with one another rationally and emotionally, and with different conceptions of time. The collaborations thus can be characterised by a complex fusion of rationality, emotionality and temporality. On the one hand, multi-stakeholder dialogic collaborations stimulate learning, facilitate relationship building and build social capital for implementing sustainable development. They thus prove themselves as potent governance mechanisms that can help to institutionalise sustainable development. On the other hand, multi-stakeholder dialogic collaborations for sustainability are highly messy, unpredictable, paradoxical and conflict-ridden processes of stakeholder engagement. They are shown to suffer from three major problematics: problematic of misunderstandings; problematic of stakeholders&#8217; emotions; and problematic of stakeholders&#8217; time. They thus, ironically and paradoxically, are also problematic solutions for sustainability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stakeholder theory</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Collaboration</field><field name="subject">Dialogue</field><field name="subject">Institutional change</field><field name="subject">Critical hermeneutics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinetics and kinematics of strength and power development</field><field name="creator">Harris, Nigel</field><field name="description">The use of the squat exercise (and its derivatives) in gym-based settings is widespread owing to perceived functional performance enhancing effects.  In particular, there has been preponderance amongst practitioners with loads that maximise power outputs (Pmax) based on a perception that mechanical peak power is directly related to explosive functional performance such as sprinting ability.  The optimal muscular quality associated with squats remains elusive though, mostly due to methodological limitations in the research.  The four experimental studies in this thesis sought to quantify the kinetic and kinematic outputs of a machine squat-jump and their relationship to sprinting ability, both descriptively and across a training period.  First, an analysis of the kinetic and kinematic outputs of a machine squat-jump across a spectrum of loads was performed, with an emphasis on power output.  Then, the relationship of these outputs with sprint ability was investigated.  Correlations do not imply cause and effect, thus a training intervention was undertaken to quantify the relationships of the change in performance measures over time, and allow a comparison of different training protocols.  Specifically, one training group was prescribed training loads based on individually determined peak power outputs, and the other based on traditional maximal strength training loads.  Because the intention of this thesis was to enhance our knowledge of best strength training practice for elite sporting performance, highly trained athletes were specifically chosen as subjects, cognizant of the population specific nature of training adaptation. In study one, it was determined that the point on the power-load spectrum where peak and mean power occurred in the machine squat-jump was 21.6 &#177; 7.1 %1RM (mean &#177; SD) and 39.0 &#177; 8.6 %1RM respectively although there was considerable individual variation in these points.  A broad plateau in power outputs was evident for most subjects with at most a 9.9% (90% confidence limits &#177;2.4%) difference in peak or means power at loads up to 20 %1RM either side of the peak.  Studies two and three established that, of the multiple kinetic and kinematic measures investigated, only 1RM strength, work and impulse (all relative to body mass) provided any indication of useful kinetic / kinematic outputs that were potentially worthwhile developing for enhancing sprint performance, albeit with only moderate correlations (r = ~ -0.3).  Additionally, the intercorrelations between maximal strength and explosive kinetic and kinematic measures were only moderate (r = ~0.3), casting doubt on the common practice of pursuing high 1RM strength with the intention of improving explosive muscle performance.  The training study provided evidence that training at the load that maximised individual peak power output was no more effective for improving sprint ability than training at heavy loads and the changes in kinetic and kinematic outputs were not usefully related to changes in sprint ability.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sports training</field><field name="subject">Strength, power, force inter-relationships</field><field name="subject">Athletic training</field><field name="subject">Power loads</field><field name="subject">Heavy loads</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/395</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The meaning of being in dilemma in paediatric practice: a phenomenological study</field><field name="creator">Water, Tineke</field><field name="description">This study explores the phenomenon of dilemma in paediatric practice. Using a hermeneutic phenomenological method informed by the writings of Heidegger [1889-1976] and Gadamer [1900 -2002] this study provides an understanding of the meaning of &#8216;being in dilemma&#8217; from the perspective of predominantly paediatric health care professionals but also families in New Zealand. Study participants include four families who had a child requiring health care and fifteen health care practitioners from the disciplines of medicine, nursing, physiotherapy, play specialist and occupational therapy who work with families and children requiring health care. Participants&#8217; narratives of their experiences of &#8216;being in dilemma&#8217; were captured via audio taped interviewing. These stories uncover the everyday realities facing health professionals and families and provide an ontological understanding for the notion of dilemma. The findings of this study suggest that experience of dilemma for health professionals reveals a world that is uncertain and questionable where they are thrown into having to make uncomfortable choices and must live with the painful consequences of their actions. The consequences of being in such dilemma have to find ways of living with the angst, or risk becoming too sensitive or desensitizing. For families the experience of dilemma reveals a similar phenomenon most evident in circumstances where they feel totalized by the impact of heath care encounters. This study has uncovered that the perspectives that health professionals and families bring to the experience of dilemma reveal different concerns and commitments and may be hidden from each other. This thesis proposes that health professionals and families need support in living with their own personal encounters of enduring experiences of dilemma.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Child health</field><field name="subject">Healthcare practice</field><field name="subject">Heideggerian hermeneutic phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Medical choices</field><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The lived reality of men who have been violent/violated</field><field name="creator">Bryant, John</field><field name="description">This qualitative research study examines the stories of five men's lived experiences of violence and violation. It is derived from conversations with the men that have been taped and transcribed. These in turn have been categorised into key existential themes and interpreted by myself as the researcher. The process of data collection, transcription and analysis has been performed under strict adherence to the tenets of a rigorous, ethical and trustworthy qualitative approach to undertaking research. Participant's revelations of their unique experiences of violence have been carefully and sensitively interpreted and given meaning through the lens of my personal worldview informed by a philosophical perspective. I have fully acknowledged my own influences upon the proceedings. The methodology that has informed this undertaking is based upon Martin Heidegger's (1927/1962) hermeneutic phenomenology. Phenomenology emphasises the search for raw experience buried in the text and takes me to the heart of men's lived reality of violence. Hermeneutics offers me a way of making meaning out of the subtext concealed within men's stories of violence. Heidegger's philosophy offers me a particular approach for understanding human experience. Van Manen's (1990) existential life world structures guide me towards violence as it is lived rather than as it is thought to be. As such this study emphasises ontological understanding over epistemological examination. The intention of this work is produce an understanding of the impact of violence on people's lives from the unique perspective of those who have experienced it. Its ultimate goal is to use this information to better understand the aetiology of male violence, and, more specifically, five men whose lives have been situated in the world of violence, so that it may be more effectively prevented.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Men</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="subject">Violence</field><field name="subject">Violence in men</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/24</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of ESOL teachers' attitudes towards teaching about taboo English in the second language classroom</field><field name="creator">Holster, Dianna</field><field name="description">Taboo English is an area of inquiry that has been overlooked in the research literature. Little appears to be published on the phenomenon of taboo language and its teaching implications for adult ESL/EFL students learning conversational English. This study aimed to investigate the attitudes and opinions of 80 ESOL teachers from 10 language schools in Auckland, New Zealand, towards the use of Taboo English in society and their attitudes towards teaching about taboo language to adult learners of conversational English. The project used a questionnaire designed to elicit a combination of both qualitative and quantitative data. Results showed that Taboo English was a valuable aspect of ESOL teachers' linguistic repertoire and that both males and females used taboo words in complex and diverse ways to communicate ideas quickly and efficiently. One of the key findings of the study contradicted the typical stereotype that females are more conservative in their taboo use than males. Another major theme that emerged was the linguistic prejudice towards teaching about Taboo English in the second language classroom. The vast majority of ESOL teachers in the study displayed little, if any, enthusiasm for teaching about taboo words to adult learners of conversational English despite acknowledging that taboo words are frequently heard in society today. This study concludes that Taboo language is an undeniable reality of English language use and that ESOL teachers, preparing adult learners to understand everyday language they will be exposed to in the 'real' world, need to address Taboo English to some degree. By not addressing this controversial language, teachers are insufficiently preparing learners to become empowered communicators in English.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">Obscene words</field><field name="subject">Swearing</field><field name="subject">English Language</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/35</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of service delivery: the difference between front-line employees' and customer's perception of the service delivery within the New Zealand real estate industry</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Vicki</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to investigate the difference between front-line employees' perception of service versus the customer's perception of the service delivery within the New Zealand Real Estate Industry. This research examines the service perception of the service delivery within the real estate industry using an exploratory study, pre-test and a survey. The lack of knowledge within real estate particularly around the importance of services has been a major motivator for this research. In reviewing the literature, a substantial amount of literature was available on service delivery however there was a gap in the literature on the service delivery in the real estate industry. This research addresses this gap through analysing the real estate industry, focusing on the Auckland market. Four dimensions of service were identified using SERVQUAL. Findings from the factor analysis showed that employees and clients have different perceptions of service. The management implications are wide and will positively impact the industry.

Such courses have traditionally prioritised writing as the most significant literacy requirement (Johns, 1981). This prioritisation of writing reflects the perception that expertise in writing is an indication that students have acquired the cognitive skills demanded for university work (Weigle, 2002). It also reflects the fact that the majority of assessment tasks, which tend to drive student learning (Schwartz &amp; Webb, 2002), require some form of writing. For EAP courses to be effective, curriculum design needs to be informed by knowledge of current academic discourse demands and writing requirements in relevant discipline areas. Analysis of previous studies indicates that written assessment tasks vary between discipline areas. Findings also suggest that the most frequent assessment types vary over time as theoretical approaches to assessment change. This suggests the need to investigate the discipline-specific demands faced by different student cohorts enrolled on EAP courses. Some studies have identified the need for students to develop the skills involved in interpreting task instructions, as well as addressing the relevant topic and meeting the specific assessment requirements (Gravatt et al., 1997 and Carson, 2001). A key impetus for this study relates to this finding and was the fact that students enrolled on EAP courses were having difficulties interpreting instructions and marking criteria provided for some assessments in discipline-specific papers. The aims of this study were three-fold. The first was to investigate and analyse the type and form of written assessment tasks and related requirements, in three undergraduate courses. The second was to investigate lecturers' perceptions and intentions in producing these tasks. Thirdly, the study aimed to investigate and describe students' understandings and experiences of the same tasks. The study therefore involved a triangulated methodology in terms of data collection. The three methods employed were analysis of assessment documents, semi-structured interviews with the lecturers concerned, and questionnaire surveys of students enrolled on the three papers. The results of the study reinforce the findings of earlier studies in that there are considerable differences between discipline areas in assessment types and in the levels of associated cognitive demands. Although the study identifies what appears to be a new assessment type at undergraduate level - the 'literature review' assignment - lecturers' expectations for this assessment appear to vary between discipline areas. The differences identified appear to be influenced by lecturers' perceptions of the role of assessment, which in this case seem to be limited to the concept of assessment as the certification of learning, and as being predominantly summative in function. Furthermore the study shows that a significant proportion of student respondents found the majority of assessment instructions difficult to understand, and that only one of the papers provided assessment criteria. The findings suggest that the absence of explicit marking criteria appears to disadvantage non-English speaking background students in particular. The conclusions of the thesis focus primarily on the dual, 'critical pragmatic', role of EAP practitioners in seeking to inform curriculum design and also to influence assessment practice; the implications of the study for the university's assessment and academic literacy policies and their implementation; the implications of the findings for EAP curriculum design, and suggestions for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Academic writing</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/48</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Midwives' experiences of working with women in labour: interpreting the meaning of pain</field><field name="creator">Vague, Stephanie</field><field name="description">A key midwifery activity is the support of a woman in labour. Pain in labour has been extensively researched from the woman's perspective, but less has been explored in relation to the midwife and her approach to pain. The way in which the midwife works with a woman and her pain in labour is the focus of this qualitative study, using Heideggerian hermeneutic phenomenology. This philosophical approach seeks to uncover or illuminate aspects of the midwife's practice which are frequently taken for granted in their everydayness. Seven midwives, including both independent practitioners and hospital-employed, were interviewed. Their narratives were analysed to uncover the meaning of the way in which midwives work with women and their pain in labour. The findings of this thesis suggest that midwives work by interpreting the woman's pain. Before the pain begins, they 'leap ahead' to help them anticipate the pain and how they will confront it. During labour, midwives give pain meaning by translating its purpose in that context. They 'leap in' when required, sometimes using 'self as an intervention. Midwives interpret women's pain through their understanding of lived time. They know how the perception of time passing changes depending on the setting for labour or the amount of anxiety and pain the woman is experiencing. Midwives use time in their work. They break it down to help a woman focus on a single contraction rather than looking too far ahead toward the unknown. Time can be a midwife's friend when the arrival of the baby replaces the urgent need for pain relief. It can also be her enemy if her interpretation of a woman's pain differs from the woman's perception. The memory of pain may persist for the woman, after labour has finished, with a backlash for the midwife. Some midwives believe in the process of birth and the woman's ability to labour with such conviction that they gain a woman's complete trust. At her most vulnerable time, they encourage the woman to call upon inner reserves and be truly empowered by her experience.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwives</field><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Pain</field><field name="subject">Childbirth</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/72</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling tribal genealogies for information systems design and development</field><field name="creator">Litchfield, Alan</field><field name="description">The study seeks to answer the question: What are the human and cultural factors in the whakapapa process?

These approaches, the Locus and the Demotic, oppose each other on what to store, how it should be stored and how it may be retrieved. The approaches are the result of cultural patterns that have evolved and raise issues about the treatment of data in information systems. Issues are argued against the work of Foucault and are subsequently addressed before the data that is gathered for the study are analysed. The work of Foucault is adopted and key concepts are arrived at: Kotahitanga/Herkunft, the representation of subtle, singular, and sub-individual marks that may connect and link a person to others, forming a dense network that is difficult to unravel; Hei Ahua/Entstehung, the exact essence nature of something; and, T&#175;imatanga/Ursprung, the state held at the moment of arising. These establish a framework for the analysis of data. Foucault identifies two types of person, the Genealogist and the Historian. In the study these types are used to represent the approach taken by the Locus and the Demotic. They are contrasted against each other throughout the study to show how their approaches differ in vital ways. The process of comparing and contrasting the Genealogist and the Historian includes qualitative analysis and symbolic interactionism. The ethnographic analysis method, symbolic interactionism, is used to analyse primary data sources. Qualitative analysis is used to analyse secondary sources. Together, they are used to derive a cohesive set of 38 symbols that are recognisable as factors in the development of the information system. The 38 symbols are aggregated to arrive at 29 human and cultural factors in the whakapapa process. The factors can be used to guide the development of an information system for managing complex data structures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori (New Zealand people) - Genealogy</field><field name="subject">System design</field><field name="subject">Whakapapa - Kupu</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/84</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The modern journeyman: influences and controls of apprentice style learning in culinary education</field><field name="creator">Emms, Simone Maria</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the shift from traditional on-site industry education (apprentice style learning) to tertiary education in academically-centred institutions, with particular emphasis on professional culinary education. With the deceptively seamless transition of numerous crafts and trades from their traditional apprentice/journeyman training and education schemes, into the tertiary education sector - from the late 1960s up until today - a crack had been created in the education process. The government had acknowledged that the possible 'confusion' and 'drop back' in traditional training schemes and apprenticeships had, to some extent, been a case of confusion or misinterpretation on the part of trade and industry and new trainees. Particularly, when the general comprehension of the 'newly' altered Education Act, New Apprenticeship Act and government-promoted shift of autonomous industry bodies to a centralised State controlled system had been largely ineffective, there was an observable decline in the traditionally mentored and educated crafts and trades. The investigation extends beyond the recent 'symptoms' of changing government Acts, extensively developing (global) tertiary education and evolving industry education responsibility to explore the deeper influences and controls of change which have brought us to where we are today. This exploration will cover a diversity of education history, government policy, industry renovation and significant world events which have changed the path of the modern journeyman and professional craft and trade education. Within the New Zealand context, little research has been found or published on this particularly involved theme [the Modern Journeyman and professional culinary education], which, by its absence has contributed to a wide chasm of unanswered enquiries and uncertainties, which now needs to be investigated. This treatise explores three key areas of 'power and control' within the arenas of politics, education and industry education. These are considered through the multi-perspective lenses of critical social science, existentialism and postmodernism. Specific attention is paid to the practical aspects of the evolving (culinary) Journeyman and the seemingly repetitive patterns of 'power and control' that have emerged from the multifarious disciplines and time-frames. Throughout the development of Western European education and the advancement of craft and trade (knowledge and practices), there has been a question of value, ownership and 'privilege' attached to who, how, where and what can be taught and learnt. And in many cases the State has either stepped in to regulate the process - as a matter of civil duty, or has taken over the process - as a form of social and ideological control. In the case of the Culinary Journeyman, the New Zealand tertiary system and the shifting authorities of professional knowledge and practice, the price which may eventually be extracted for the targeted control of education practice (mentored/apprenticed learning) and professional knowledge development, may be more than the cost of an admission to a professional tertiary cookery course in the future.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cookery</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Apprentices</field><field name="subject">Hospitality industry</field><field name="subject">Employees</field><field name="subject">Cooks</field><field name="subject">Training of</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/85</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modern women or tree-hugging hippies? A Foucauldian discourse analysis of the New Zealand media's representation of waterbirth.</field><field name="creator">Ashcroft, Shelley</field><field name="description">This study has identified the discourses surrounding water birth and analyses how these discourses are utilised by the media in New Zealand to represent water birth. The philosophical approach that underpins the study is that of philosopher Michel Foucault and his theory on discourse, power and the subject. His framework is used in a discourse analysis to reveal three main discourses: the scientific medical discourse, the natural birth discourse and the dive reflex discourse. Data used for this study consisted of 30 newspaper articles containing the word 'water birth' collected over a five-year period (2000-2005) from New Zealand's eight main broadsheet newspapers. Analysis was a two-part process: Foucauldian discourse analysis and a media discourse analysis (Fairclough, 1995b).Firstly, the discourse analysis showed the subject and the power positions each discourse offered women for positioning themselves in that discourse. The literature and texts revealed Foucault's theory on power relations and resultant subjectivity within institutions and how waterbirth within institutions is disciplined, surveilled, excluded and circulated. The second part of the analysis revealed how the media chooses to deploy the three identified discourses that represent waterbirth  in New Zealand. This textual analysis followed the framework of Fairclough's (1995b) media discourse analysis, showing media strategies that are used to promote the discourse deemed to be ideologically significant by the media outlet. Textual analysis identified that the scientific medical discourse contests waterbirth as an unsafe, unproven practice that puts babies' lives at risk. This discourse categorises women who choose waterbirth as unsafe, irrational, alternative, tree-hugging hippies who favour perceived benefits of waterbirth for themselves above the safety of their baby. The natural birth discourse contests that waterbirth is a safe practice that has encountered few problems since its emergence as a validated birthing practice in the late 1980s. It promotes waterbirth as having multiple benefits for both mother and baby and as a way of enhancing the physiological process of birth through non-intervention. The dive reflex discourse underpins the issue of babies drowning when born into water. This discourse details a reflex that suppresses the normal breathing mechanisms in neonates at birth. Literature debates its existence and troubles the overall trustworthiness of such a reflex to prevent a baby drowning when born into water. It is this discourse that sways people's views and positioning on the overall discourse of waterbirth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="subject">Discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Water birth</field><field name="subject">New Zealand media</field><field name="subject">Newspapers</field><field name="subject">Ideologies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the reuse of organic waste produced by the New Zealand mussel industry</field><field name="creator">Barnaby, Claire</field><field name="description">Management of organic waste is a major problem for the New Zealand Mussel Industry. Currently most waste is discarded, and this represents a potential loss of both resources and revenue, unless an alternative use for this waste could be developed. Waste types were first identified, then quantified, first seasonally, then annually, to provide an estimate of total industry-wide waste production. Possible uses for this waste were then identified. Little investigative research has been undertaken on identifying alternative uses for mussel industry organic waste. The uses of organic waste as organic fertilizers, and the economic benefit of adding treated waste products to cement mix to improve its compressive strength and thermal insulation, are two primary objectives of this dissertation. The possibility of using mussel shell in agricultural liming as a substitute is also explored. The potential value of pre-grade waste as an organic fertilizer was explored by addition of decomposed tissue to tomato seedlings and by monitoring plant development and condition. Growth of treatment and control seedlings was monitored by counting the number of branches, stem heights, leaf numbers and total biomass. Analyses prove Perna canaliculus pre-grade organic waste has the potential to be exploited as an expensive, effective organic fertilizer, whereas Mytilus galloprovincialis pre-grade organic waste may not. Moreover, there is further potential to develop P. canaliculus pre-grade organic waste into an odourless, chemically stable fertilizer product. The potential value of post-grade waste in cement mixes to improve compressive strength was explored by addition of shell aggregate to cement mix. Analyses indicate that, as an aggregate, mussel shell has little to no structural potential, but does have latent thermal insulating properties. Recommendations are made to: - Separate Perna and Mytilus pre-grade waste products. - Further explore the thermal insulating potential of mussel-shell concrete. - Further explore techniques for treatment of Perna pre-grade waste as a fertilizer. - Further explore the use of crushed mussel shell as a potential limestone or sand substitute for agricultural,                                 construction and engineering purposes. - Explore markets for Mytilus potential export, to reduce pre-grade waste production and problems of resettlement.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mussel fisheries</field><field name="subject">Environmental studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the thesis/dissertation writing experiences of Mandarin-speaking Masters students in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chang, Evelyn Chiungying</field><field name="description">This study explores the perceptions of Mandarin-speaking Masters students involved in the thesis/dissertation writing process. As Mandarin-speaking students form a sizeable part of the EAL [English as Additional Language] postgraduate cohort in New Zealand, it is important to explore their experiences. The aim of the proposed study is to provide an opportunity for these learners to express issues that are pertinent to them in this area. The study recruited 37 Masters Students from five universities to participate in the survey; 6 of these participants volunteered to be interviewed. Two aspects of the participants' perceptions were examined: the acquisition of academic literacy in English and the role of the supervisor in relation to their thesis writing. Findings indicated that students had underestimated how difficult it would be to study at this level in a foreign language and in a new sociocultural environment. They also indicated that the language assistance provided by supervisors was perceived to be very helpful and that mutual understanding and personal interaction between supervisors and students is crucial for successful supervision. However, better structured academic and pastoral support is required from the host universities. In addition, participants placed great emphasis on their personal growth and learning. The significance of the study lies in its cross-cultural accounts of the underlying complexities involved in EAL thesis writing. Findings underline the need for New Zealand universities to recognise the importance of cross-cultural awareness and its role in fostering campuses that are interculturally friendly.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Loss before life begins: the invisible babies and their invisible deaths</field><field name="creator">Rose, Tina</field><field name="description">My experience of baby loss was an isolated learning experience and the main objective of my research was to help better resource other women who may find themselves lost in the system caring for women when their babies die. Particularly, I wanted to highlight and possibly remedy the invisibility of women and their babies that die between 12 and 20 weeks gestation. Loss Before Life Begins was written as four journalistic articles with one of the goals to be that all or some of the articles achieve publication in a mainstream New Zealand magazine. I focussed all the research on the last 20 years, beginning in 1985. Firstly, because it coincides with the establishment of Miscarriage Support Auckland, the first group of its kind in New Zealand. Secondly, because it ensured that the participants' stories would be relevant in the current context of how baby loss is treated by society, the media and the health system. Each article had a specific purpose and aim. Firstly, The Language of Loss investigated the background of our popular understanding of baby loss, including the legal categorisations of baby loss in different gestational periods. It also included research into the language commonly used by health professionals working with women whose babies have died. Quotes from the five women who were participants in the thesis were interwoven in the article. Their stories illustrated the effects of insensitive language on a woman's experience, and the perception of care and treatment received by health professionals. Then I reviewed all mainstream media articles published in New Zealand from 1985. This disclosed the lack of articles about baby loss, and the general dearth of practical information provided when stories did appear. Secondly, And Mother Makes Me was the narrative of the five women's stories interviewed about their babies' deaths between 12 and 20 weeks gestation. I discovered that this timeframe is 'invisible' because women under 20 weeks are not part of the obstetric system, and are cared for by nurses instead of midwives. These mothers are invisible, as are their babies' deaths. Article three, The 'System' and the People Working In It encompasses the sometimes conflicting views of four leading health professionals. Possible explanations for why women whose babies die under 20 weeks are treated differently to women whose babies are considered stillborn were included. Conflicting views about the importance of the media's role emerged. Small changes in the use of medical language by health professionals were outlined. Finally, possible reasons for society's difficulty with the concept of death, and specifically the difficulties when a woman's baby dies before its life has begun were uncovered. The fourth and final article, The Way It Is and The Way It Could Be summarised the background reading; media analysis from the last 20 years; the themes from the five women's stories; and the array of health professionals' views. Included are a number of specific meaningful ways that health professionals, media outlets and society can better support the invisible women when their babies die. These include updating medical language printed in brochures; including fact boxes in editorials; giving women and their families an opportunity to talk about their losses; and reviewing 'the system' that allows women who lose babies between 12 and 20 weeks to be cared for by nurses instead of midwives.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Miscarriage</field><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/154</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanical, hormonal and metabolic responses to two resistance loading schemes</field><field name="creator">Crewther, Blair Tehira</field><field name="description">The effective prescription of resistance exercise for strength and power development has been a source of debate amongst practitioners and sport scientist alike. One of the key issues in this area relates to the training load that would best facilitate strength and power adaptation. Heavy loads (&gt;60-70% 1RM) have been traditionally used for maximal strength development by facilitating changes in neural function (strength) and muscle size (hypertrophy). However, many studies have now found lighter load (&gt;45%1RM) training equally effective in improving both strength and hypertrophy. Similarly, many studies have found heavy load training effective in enhancing various measures of power though lighter loads (e.g. 45% 1RM) are thought to maximise the mechanical power output of muscle. Realising that adaptation depends upon some interaction between the mechanical, hormonal and metabolic stimuli, examining these responses would enhance our understanding of the underlying determinants of strength and power, and thereby improve strength and conditioning practice. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the mechanical, hormonal and metabolic responses to equal volume light and heavy loading schemes. Eleven males (mean 26.6 &#177; 6.7 years; mean 79.0 &#177; 8.1 kg) with a minimum of 12 months weight training experience each performed two exercises (Smith squat and supine squat) at a light (45% 1RM) and heavy (88% 1RM) intensity. The light scheme consisted of eight sets of six repetitions, with six sets of four repetitions performed in the heavy scheme. Rest periods of three and four minutes respectively were used. Saliva sampling was used to determine the hormonal (cortisol and testosterone) and metabolic (lactate) responses. Samples were collected at rest (pre-), immediately after the first exercise (mid-), at the conclusion of the second exercise (P0) and every 15 minutes thereafter for one hour (P15, P30, P45, P60). Mean values for all variables were analysed with a paired sample T-test. Chances that the true effects were substantial (% and qualitative) were also calculated. No significant (P&gt;0.05) difference in total forces was found between schemes; however, the light scheme produced significantly greater total time under tension (36%), total work (37%) and total power output (115%). Total impulse (38%) was the only variable found to be greater in the heavy scheme. A decrease in testosterone (TST) was observed in the heavy scheme (-4 to -29%) with no significant changes found across the light scheme (1 to 12%). Cortisol decreased in the light (-6 to -30%) and heavy (-14 to -44%) schemes until P45. An increase in the TST/cortisol ratio was observed in both the light (17 to 49%) and heavy (2 to 44%) schemes. Both loading schemes resulted in similar increases in lactate (0.3 to 1.0nmol/l). Equating two schemes by volume resulted in differential responses, many of which favoured the lighter scheme in terms of mechanical, hormonal and metabolic outputs. These findings suggest that load or intensity employed may be not as important as initially proposed and that other factors (e.g. volume, technique) may explain the similar strength and hypertrophy adaptation reported in studies comparing light and heavy schemes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Isometric exercise</field><field name="subject">Kinematics</field><field name="subject">Exercise Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/189</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Listening to New Zealand nurses: a survey of intent to leave, job satisfaction, job stress, and burnout</field><field name="creator">Daniels, Anne</field><field name="description">Human and financial costs generated by nurse shortages, within a context of increasing numbers of patients requiring nursing care, demonstrate the potential significance of this study which aims to identify work related factors contributing to New Zealand nurses' intent to leave the job. Two hundred and seventy five usable paper and pencil surveys (Response rate = 68.8%) from a random sample of 400 nurses employed in one New Zealand District Health Board were used to explore intent to leave the job. Three research questions directed the description of levels of job satisfaction, job stress, and burnout found in nurse participants, correlations between the three variables, and the identification of variables predicting intent to leave the job through regression analyses. Levels of job satisfaction were high, job stress was low, and burnout was average. Specifically, lack of opportunity to participate in organisational decision making, control over work conditions, control over what goes on in the work setting (key Magnet Hospital characteristics) were not evident, and with pay rates, were the main sources of job dissatisfaction. Workload was the most frequently experienced source of stress by nurse participants. Twenty-five per cent of nurse participants reported high levels of intent to leave the job. Correlations suggested that reductions in job satisfaction influenced increases in job stress and burnout. Job stress was associated with increases in emotional exhaustion. Emotional exhaustion was influenced by eight job satisfaction, job stress, and burnout subscales. Five subscales (professional opportunities, praise and recognition, interaction opportunities, extrinsic rewards, lack of support) explained 26.2% of the variance in nurse participant's intent to leave. Issues of power and control were associated with job dissatisfaction, job stress and burnout in nursing practice. However, predictors of intent to leave the job suggest a growing realisation by nurse participants that postgraduate education and nursing research may provide the tools to create positive change in the health care environment and make nursing visible, valued and appropriately rewarded.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nurses</field><field name="subject">Job stress</field><field name="subject">Employment</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/199</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The modern nomad in New Zealand: a study of the effects of the working holiday schemes on free independent travellers and their host communities</field><field name="creator">Newlands, Kenneth John</field><field name="description">Tourism is often described as having arisen from the Grand Tour of the young aristocracy of the eighteenth century who travelled around Europe for a period of a few years to further their education. Adler argues that, rather than seeing the development of tourism as an evolution from the young aristocracy to the adoption of the tour by the middle classes, the young travellers of today can also be traced back to tramping "a well institutionalised travel pattern of working class youth" (1985, p.335). The modern day Working Holiday is taken by a wide cross section of many societies travelling for a variety of purposes. The Working Holiday Schemes discussed are reciprocal arrangements between New Zealand and sixteen other countries (as at May 2003) that allow young people to work and holiday in each other's countries, for up to a year. The aims of the research are to discover who these visitors are, what work and holiday experiences they have, their motivations for coming to New Zealand and also to compare the intentions of the schemes, as outlined in policy found in cabinet briefing papers, with the actualities of the scheme, as reported by Working Holidaymakers, employers and community members. The study uncovers the background to policy decisions in the tourism / immigration domain. No research has been carried out on the Working Holidaymakers coming to New Zealand or about the policies that support this movement. It will be argued that Working Holidaymakers contribute both as a source of labour to many industries and as significant consumers of tourism product. Consequently this research is of interest to the academic community, government and industry groups including the horticultural and broader farming industry, tourism sectors such as hospitality, accommodation, transport, attractions and activity providers, and to a lesser extent training and educational institutions. The research focuses on the characteristics of a convenience sample of Working Holidaymakers. The thesis is supported by a small case study that explores the schemes from the perspectives of host communities and employers. During the period that the research was undertaken the number of countries involved and the number of working holiday visas increased significantly. During 2005, 36,000 visas were made available to suitable applicants from twenty-five countries. The growth in the numbers of Working Holidaymakers suggests that it is time to review the policy formation about Working Holiday Schemes and challenge the traditional definition of a tourist as a non-worker. Recommendations are made for improving the schemes, contributing to policy decisions and to for a wider interpretation of the term tourist.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Employment in foreign countries</field><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/214</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the effect of stretching frequency on range of motion at the ankle joint</field><field name="creator">Trent, Vanessa</field><field name="description">Stretching is a widely prescribed technique that has been demonstrated to increase range of motion. Consequently it may enhance performance and aid in the prevention and treatment of injury. Few studies have investigated the frequency of stretching on a daily basis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of stretching frequency on range of motion at the ankle joint. The detraining effect was also investigated after a period without stretching. Thirty-one female subjects participated in this study. They were randomly assigned to a control group who did not stretch a group who stretched two times per week (Stretch-2) or a group who stretched four times per week (Stretch-4). The stretching intervention was undertaken over four weeks and targeted the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Each stretch was held for duration of 30 seconds and repeated five times. Prior to the intervention (PRE), dorsiflexion was measured using a weights and pulley system that passively moved the ankle joint from a neutral position into dorsiflexion. After the four week stretching period (POST), dorsiflexion was measured once again to determine the change following the stretching programme. Following a further four week period where no stretching took place (FINAL), dorsiflexion was measured to determine the detraining effect. Electromyography was used to monitor the activity of the plantarflexors and dorsiflexors during the measuring procedure. The results of the study showed a significant increase in ankle joint range of motion for the Stretch-4 group (p&lt;0.05) when comparing PRE and POST measurements. The Stretch-2 and control groups did not show significant differences (p&gt;0.05) between PRE and POST measurements. When comparing the PRE and FINAL measurements of the Stretch-4 group, no significant differences were recorded (p&gt;0.05). The POST and FINAL measurements were significantly different (p&lt;0.05). After the detraining period the Stretch-4 group lost 99.8% of their range of motion gains. The present data provide some evidence that the viscoelastic properties of the muscle stretched were unchanged by the four week static stretching programme. The mechanism involved in the observed increase in range of motion for the Stretch-4 group is possibly that of enhanced stretch tolerance of the subject. Further research is required to support this conjecture.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ankle</field><field name="subject">Stretch (Physiology)</field><field name="subject">Stretching exercises</field><field name="subject">Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Joints</field><field name="subject">Range of motion</field><field name="subject">Measurement</field><field name="subject">Ankle joint</field><field name="subject">Health studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Keeping birth normal: midwives experiences in a secondary care setting: a qualitative study</field><field name="creator">Earl, Deborah J</field><field name="description">It has been said that within a secondary care setting, surrounded by medical influences, it is difficult for midwives to keep birth normal. This qualitative study has been conducted to answer the question: "What are midwives' experiences of keeping birth normal within a secondary care setting?" van Manen's (1990) hermeneutic thematic analysis was the method used to analyse the data generated from this study. Eight "core" or hospital-based midwives were interviewed. The interviews were tape recorded and transcribed into text and were analysed to come to a deeper understanding of the research question. There are three data chapters that reveal the themes that emerged from the data: "Being a midwife 'is' keeping birth normal", "Stepping back and stepping in" and "Interacting with the doctor". The findings of the study revealed that seeing, knowing, and believing in normal birth leads to an embodied sense of "being" that infuses the way midwives practise. This knowledge needs to be passed on to junior midwives. Midwives judge when to use technology and intervention and the appropriate timing of intervention. The Relationships between medical practitioners and midwives is a key to keeping birth normal. Ultimately, it is through teamwork that normal birth is safeguarded. The midwives in this study demonstrate a quiet yet determined courage to constantly question the decisions that might take away from the "normal" experience. They do not say that intervention is not necessary, but question the appropriate use of intervention. This questioning keeps normal birth a possibility.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwives</field><field name="subject">Childbirth</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/267</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The kinematic, kinetic and blood lactate profiles of continuous and intra-set rest loading schemes</field><field name="creator">Denton, Jamie</field><field name="description">The optimisation of strength and power through resistance training has been the source of debate amongst health professionals and researchers for many years. As resistance training involves the repeated activation and contraction of skeletal muscles, continuous training will ultimately result in a failure to sustain the training intensity especially when performing multiple sets and / or repetitions. Therefore the prescription of rest periods within the training session becomes an important consideration. Relatively short rest periods (60-90 seconds) have been traditionally used for the maximal strength adaptation involving increases in the cross-sectional area of the muscle, whereas longer rest periods (180-300 seconds) have traditionally been used for the maximal strength adaptation involving enhancement of neural function and maximal power adaptation. However, there is very little scientific evidence to support these current practices. In fact, the effect of different rest periods on maximal strength and power development has received very little research attention. Additionally, research that has been conducted in this area has been typified by a number of methodological inconsistencies, within and between studies, which confound scientific understanding. Although traditionally resistance training has employed continuous training schemes with inter-set rest periods, intra-set rest training methods which distribute rest intervals between groups of repetitions have also been investigated. It has been theorised that the short rest periods within the training set allow partial resynthesis of the intramuscular phosphocreatine stores, potentially allowing an athlete to increase their training volume by training at high intensities for longer durations, or performing additional repetitions (Berg, 2003). This is thought to lead to an increased exposure of the muscle to the kinematic and kinetic stimuli thought important for strength and power adaptation whilst minimising performance-inhibiting metabolic accumulation and substrate depletion. However, research into intra-set rest training schemes is still in its infancy, and many of the theories surrounding intra-set rest training are currently unsubstantiated. It is thought that examinations of the acute kinematic, kinetic and blood lactate profiles of continuous and intra-set rest training schemes may enhance scientific understanding regarding the efficacy of intra-set rest training. The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the acute kinematic, kinetic and blood lactate responses to continuous and intra-set rest loading schemes. Nine male subjects performed an isoinertial Smith machine bench press task (6RM load) with a continuous loading scheme (CONT), an intra-set rest loading scheme equated by total rest time, volume and load (ISRV) and an intra-set rest loading scheme equated by total rest time and load (ISRR). The order of the loading schemes was assigned in a block randomised order with a minimum of 48 hours recovery between each testing session. Attached to the bar of the Smith machine was a linear position transducer that measured vertical displacement with an accuracy of 0.01cm. Displacement data was sampled at 1000Hz and collected by a laptop computer running custom built data acquisition software. Finger prick blood lactate samples were taken from the non-dominant hand using sterile techniques at the following time points: pre-exercise (Pre), immediately post-exercise (P0), five (P5), fifteen (P15) and thirty minutes (P30) post exercise. Blood glucose samples were taken pre-exercise only. It was observed that manipulating the rest period, by increasing the frequency but decreasing the length of each rest period, did not significantly influence the kinematics and kinetics associated with resistance training, but did have an effect on the post-exercise blood lactate response when the load, rest duration and training volume was equated (ISRV). This finding may be of practical significance if fatigue is important in strength development or conversely if power training needs to be performed with minimal fatigue. It was also observed that increasing the frequency of the rest period enabled the subjects to perform a greater number of repetitions (ISRR), resulting in significantly greater kinematics, kinetics and blood lactate accumulation. It may be speculated, therefore, that ISRR training may offer a superior training stimulus for the development of maximal strength and hypertrophy than CONT training methods, as ISRR loading increased the exposure of the muscle to the kinematic, kinetic and metabolic stimuli thought important for the development of these qualities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blood lactate</field><field name="subject">Kinematics</field><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Kinetics</field><field name="subject">Exercise Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mind shift: creating change through narrative learning cycles</field><field name="creator">Grainger, Jenny Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the process of an annual appraisal strategy, &#8216;clinical conversation&#8217;, from the perspective of seven nurses who were assessed using this technique.

The research used a qualitative interpretive approach informed by the model of Grounded Theory espoused by Strauss and Corbin.  All eight nurses who were assessed using the clinical conversation strategy were advanced practitioners working within the scope of sexual and reproductive health.  Two of the actual appraisals were observed and seven of the nurses were interviewed within eight weeks of being assessed. The outcome of the clinical conversation was primarily one of learning; the acquisition of new insights into self as practitioner.  The learning was facilitated through the process of narration; telling the story of clinical practice.  Three distinct narrative cycles were identified, each an experiential learning episode.  The experience of undertaking a variety of assessment activities created a narrative with self and triggered an internal reflective thinking process; the experience of working with a peer created an additional narrative, a mutual dialogue reflecting back on practice; the experience of sharing practice with an assessor created a further and final narrative, a learning conversation.   Each narrative can be seen as a catalyst for change.  Primarily, the nurses felt differently about themselves in practice, the way they saw themselves had shifted.  Such a change can be described as an alteration in perspective.  These alterations in perspective led all nurses to identify ways in which they would change their actual clinical practice.  In this way the nurses attempted to align their espoused beliefs about practice with their actual practice. My study shows that each nurse responded differently to each narrative learning cycle: for some the conversation with the assessor was more of a catalyst for change than for others.  In this way clinical conversation may be flexible enough to respond to a variety of differing learning styles.  Learning was person specific which is an imperative for the continued professional development of already highly skilled clinicians. The implication of the research is that whilst clinical conversation was designed as a tool for appraising clinical competence, its intrinsic value lies in supporting the professional development of nurses.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative interpretive</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="subject">Clinical appraisal</field><field name="subject">Learning conversation</field><field name="subject">Reflection</field><field name="subject">Professional development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mobile data services adoption in New Zealand: future predictions</field><field name="creator">Cosgrove, Steve</field><field name="description">The fast pace of development in the Mobile Data Services area means innovators have to remain vigilant to stay in the market.  There is not time to undertake the usual market development cycles.  As a consequence, researchers are looking at various ways to predict the adoption rate of a new product and ways to better forecast adoption in different niche contexts.  Rogers&#8217; (2003) provides a review of historical trends in innovation and diffusion studies, and the foundational (1962) model he developed.  In the context of the most recent literature, it is found that Rogers&#8217; generic model still works well, but variations built on his model need to be considered.  In particular, the &#8216;Chasm&#8217; model, developed by Moore (1999), adapts Rogers&#8217;s model to cope well with the 21st century business environment. Gilbert (2005) has taken the work of both Rogers and Moore and applied the learning to research into adoption rates and characteristics in cross-cultural situations. In New Zealand the past consumer behaviour when new mobile services have been introduced has shown a number of characteristics and specific problems. Vodafone New Zealand provides mobile services only and they now claim 54% market share (Vodafone 2005`).  An early success was to significantly lower the cost of sending text messages (SMS), followed by promotion of that service to the teenage market sector.  In contrast to the popularity of SMS, introduction of the WAP mobile Internet protocol was not successful in New Zealand, as was the case elsewhere. The failure is commonly attributed to a lack of services being offered to use the technology. Near the end of 2004 Telecom New Zealand launched a new product, branded &#8216;T3G&#8217;.  Vodafone New Zealand released &#8216;Vodafone 3G&#8217; during the middle of 2005.  The technologies behind these products is generally called &#8216;3G Mobile&#8217;, or Third Generation Mobile technology.  Operators in Singapore also have 3G networks, commissioned during 2004.   Authors such as Salz et el (2004) find evidence to suggest that US network operators need to speed up the adoption of this technology to meet predicted demand. There are unique factors likely to affect in the New Zealand market.  The OECD has repeatedly found evidence that broadband Internet adoption in New Zealand is lower than other countries.  Introduction of 3G technology provides another way to access broadband Internet.  The OECD indicates that pricing is one of the barriers to broadband adoption.  Telephone companies will have to consider pricing 3G to appeal as an option to having a fixed Internet option. The key question to be addressed in this research is: Do the adoption intensions of New Zealanders match those of Malaysia and Singapore for expected data services use? A related question is: What other factors effect New Zealand's current relatively slow rate of adoption? Product positioning of mobile data products is going to become more critical, given that some telephone operators are &#8216;expecting to get 25% of revenues from mobile data within five years&#8217; (Molony, 2001).  This Thesis will provide information to assist Mobile Service Providers to predict adoption rates of new services.  It will also provide a comparative reference for researchers in other countries to replicate the study, and contribute to an exciting body of international literature.  The New Zealand market is characterised by high cost of broadband Internet in general (OECD, TUANZ, and others), proprietary knowledge capture, and regulation, but these issues do not stop research into the intensions of potential adopters. This thesis will fill part of that research void, by comparing emergent demand for mobile data with existing models, which have previously been used, to predict future demand. New Zealand has a reputation as an earlier adopter of new technologies (Min Economic Dev &amp; others).  This thesis will contribute evidence to indicate how New Zealanders plan to adopt mobile data services, and how intensions of adoption compare with parallel studies in Singapore, and other countries.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless</field><field name="subject">Survey</field><field name="subject">Mobile</field><field name="subject">Data</field><field name="subject">Structured equation modelling</field><field name="subject">Technological adoption rates</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of young M&#257;ori  women in relation to sexual health: a descriptive qualitative study</field><field name="creator">Waetford, Cathrine</field><field name="description">Good sexual and reproductive health is fundamental to the overall health status of M&#257;ori communities. In 2001, the Ministry of Health reported that New Zealand was facing a Chlamydia epidemic. This epidemic has not abated as rates of Chlamydia have increased significantly in the past five years, with disproportionately high rates in young M&#257;ori women compared to non-M&#257;ori women. Despite significant sexual health disparities, young M&#257;ori have had limited opportunities to participate in research focussed on sexual health and voice their opinions and concerns on sexual health issues. This qualitative descriptive study has used a M&#257;ori inquiry paradigm and approached the research from a Kaupapa M&#257;ori perspective. The primary research question asked what the knowledge, attitudes and reported behaviours of young urban M&#257;ori women were in regards to sexual health and in particular, the sexually transmitted infection Chlamydia. Secondary aims were to ascertain the sources of information used and accessibility of sexual health services, as well as identifying resilience factors associated with protection against Chlamydia infection. The data was collected from semi-structured interviews with 16 young M&#257;ori women living in the Auckland region. Data analysis involved the inductive approach of categorical content analysis to identify major categorical themes to answer the specific questions posed. The main conclusion was that there are a number of barriers to accessing quality sexual health information and services for young M&#257;ori women. Participants&#8217; level of knowledge varied reflecting their personal experiences and many were unaware that Chlamydia is asymptomatic and that delayed diagnosis can lead to fertility problems. The main sources of sexual health information accessed were wh&#257;nau, peers, school, and contact with health professionals. Racism was identified as one of the barriers to sexual healthcare services. The young women expressed a clear preference for sexual health services to be delivered by M&#257;ori. Most importantly, for sexual health interventions to be successful it is essential that M&#257;ori communities, including young people and their wh&#257;nau, are an integral part of creating positive solutions. Resilience factors that may help protect young women from contracting chlamydia characteristic of this group were having a strong connection with a caring adult or friend and parents who viewed sexuality as a normal part of adolescent development. In addition, having a positive M&#257;ori cultural identity with an ability to understand bicultural differences was strongly associated with participants accessing sexual healthcare services despite identified barriers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sexual health</field><field name="subject">Sexually transmitted infections</field><field name="subject">Chlamydia</field><field name="subject">Adolescent</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa Maori research</field><field name="subject">Qualitative descriptive research</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ko Marouna te toa: The effects of the Cook Islands public sector reform on the delivery of education</field><field name="creator">Puna, Repeta</field><field name="description">The effects of the public sector reform impacted on all aspects of public services including the performance of the economy.  Central to this argument was the re-organization of the operations of the public service from the traditional administration system to the new public management (NPM). Education, a critical service in any economy was not spared.  Literatures around the application of NPM (a derivative of market principles and practices) to education (which was value based) suggested that NPM was dangerous for education and could deplete the value system of education and replace that with a focus on accounting for money by individuals who were self-interested and who would seek to maximize their benefit with guile. Arguments against NPM suggested that the human factor was neglected and that education had led to chaos among professionals, stakeholders and students.  However, those who argued for the introduction of NPM suggested that it had made the provision of education more efficient, effective and relevant to the needs to the clients.  It held those working in the education sector accountable for the resources used and made the system more responsive to the needs of the clients of education. Education in the Cook Islands experienced many changes since western type education was introduced by the Missionaries in the late 1800s. Cook Islands people have always regarded education as a right and also believed their participation in education would improve their lives as well as positively contribute to economic growth.  As the public sector reform was a global phenomenon, the currents of NPM also converged on the Cook Islands and affected the delivery of education.  Those changes revolutionalized education in ways that was not commonplace in the Cook Islands.  However, professionals and stakeholders within education made the most of the system and diverged some of the practices to suit the need, the environment and the culture of the Cook Islands people.  Change also refocused education from teachers teaching to student learning reinforcing the dedication of many teachers and education administrators to ensure NPM served the best interest of their clients; the students, despite the workload placed on them.  The challenge in this thesis was to understand how the NPM system affected education and how the Cook Islands education professionals worked within the system in their favour. The stories of teachers and Ministry of Education professionals demonstrated that there was no resistance to the application of NPM system in the Cook Islands.  In fact, the system was embraced by the education sector suggesting it was a positive change from their previous system of traditional administration.  Much of their system was inherited from New Zealand where the environment, layers of bureaucracy and economic status of the country was different.  Instead, it appeared the Cook Islands took much of what others deemed as dangerous for education and turned it into a positive opportunity for the Cook Islands education.  This thesis presents the story of the revolution in the Cook Island education system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rarotonga</field><field name="subject">Survey questionnaire</field><field name="subject">Interviews</field><field name="subject">Ministry of Education</field><field name="subject">Educational reform</field><field name="subject">School management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/415</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mobile phone based remote monitoring system</field><field name="creator">Liu, Danyi</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates embedded databases and graphical interfaces for the MicroBaseJ project. The project aim is the development of an integrated database and GUI user interface for a typical 3G, or 2.5G, mobile phone with Java MIDP2 capability. This includes methods for data acquisition, mobile data and information communication, data management, and remote user interface. Support of phone delivered informatics will require integrated server and networking infrastructure research and development to support effective and timely delivery of data for incorporation in mobile device-based informatics applications. A key research and development (R&amp;D) challenge is to support effective and timely delivery of data for incorporation in mobile device-based informatics applications. Another important aspect of the project is determining how to develop efficient graphics for the small mobile screen.   The research investigates and analyses the architecture of a mobile monitoring system. The project developed a generic solution that can be implemented in a number of commercial sectors, such as horticulture, building management and pollution/water management. The developed concept is tested using data relevant to the horticultural area of application. The system also addresses the main issues related to mobile monitoring, including real-time response, data integrity, solution cost, graphical presentation, and persistent storage capabilities of modern mobile devices. Four embedded databases based on J2ME have been investigated. Two of the four have been evaluated and analysed. The Insert function, Sequence Search, and Random Search of Perst List and RMS (Record Management System) databases have been tested. The size of the processed data was limited to 20,000 records when using the wireless toolkit simulator, and 11,000 records when using a mobile phone. Perst Lite reflects good performance and has out-performed RMS in all tests. User interface software such as J2ME Polish for mobile phones has been investigated. Custom J2ME class for graphical interface is developed. This provides the graphical presentation of the data collected from the sensors; including temperature, wind speed, wind direction, moisture, and leaf wetness. The graphical interface, bar charts, and line charts with trace ball for collected data have been designed and implemented.  The embedded database performance and project performance have been investigated and analysed. The performances of Perst Lite and RMS are evaluated in terms of the insert, sequence search, and random search functions based on simulation and real devices. The record numbers vary from 1,000 to 20,000. The project performance contains data receiving and storage, and data presentation and configuration. The performance of data storage and configuration can be negated due to the running mode and the response time. Thus, data presenting performance is the key focus in this project. This performance was divided into the categories of initial, data search, data selection, and charting. The initial performance includes the initialisation of the project parameters, and the reaching of the welcome interface. Data search performance refers to the retrieval of the specified data from the embedded database, measured on 48 data points, which only can be presented on the mobile screen from the retrieved data. These four performance types are measured in thousands of record numbers, varying from 1,000 to 18,000 record numbers, with the retrieved data range varying from 1 day to 30 days.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile application</field><field name="subject">Remote control</field><field name="subject">Mobile phone technology</field><field name="subject">Cell phone technology</field><field name="subject">Mobile database applications</field><field name="subject">Graphic User Interface design</field><field name="subject">Cellular phones</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mission as Good Neighbour: social policy of the Methodist Mission Northern in the 21st century</field><field name="creator">Devanandan, B. Prince</field><field name="description">The Methodist Mission Northern has provided social services to the community since 1851. The underpinning philosophy of Methodist Mission Northern&#8217;s service provision is that of being a Good Neighbour. The concept of Good Neighbour derives from the Old and the New Testaments of the Holy Bible, the Hebrew Scriptures and also public policy. A defining moment in the emergence of Christian universalism comes when the neighbour is asserted to include everyone, &#8230; while the Levite and the Cohen pass by the injured man&#8230; the Good Samaritan comes to his aid and proves himself the true neighbour of his (injured) neighbour [Zizek, Santner, &amp; Reinhard, 2005, p. 6]. What does Good Neighbour entail in the context of so many people suffering owing to poverty, injustice and social exclusion? This study set out to examine how the concept of Good Neighbour has been put into practice and how that is relevant in contemporary public policy setting. This research was undertaken using phenomenological enquiry approach which explored the experiences of the key stakeholders namely the Board of Governors, the staff and the clients or service recipients of the Methodist Mission Northern to understand the impact of service delivery on clients. This was done through a review of the Minutes of the Board Meetings and Annual Reports over a twenty year period from 1986 to 2006. The study found that for the greater part of the history the operation of the concept of Good Neighbour by Methodist Mission Northern tended to focus on the charity model which provides for the day to day needs of the clients such as providing food, clothing and shelter and other immediate needs. For Methodist Mission Northern&#8217;s concept of Good Neighbour to reflect its underpinning philosophy more effectively the practice needs to move beyond the charity model into a community development model focussed on social change and transformation. This means meeting the needs of clients in ways that empower them to move towards independence and interdependent self sustainability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Faith based social service</field><field name="subject">Methodist Mission</field><field name="subject">Good Neighbour</field><field name="subject">Social policy</field><field name="subject">Religion and society</field><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Method and implementation of multi-channel correlation in the hybrid CPU+FPGA system</field><field name="creator">Leonov, Maxim</field><field name="description">Modern high-performance digital signal processing (DSP) applications face constantly increasing performance requirements and are becoming increasingly challenging to develop and work with. In DSP paradigm, many researchers see potential in achieving algorithm speed-up by employing Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) &#8211; reconfigurable hardware with parallelism feature. However, developing applications for FPGAs incur particular challenges on the development flow. This work proposes a scalable hybrid DSP system for performing high-performance signal processing applications. The system employs hybrid CPU + FPGA architecture of commercially available, off-the-shelf (COTS) FPGAs and central processing units (CPU) of personal computers. In this work an example implementation of a multi-channel cross-correlator is investigated and delivered using a new development paradigm. The correlator is implemented on the XD1000 development system using a high-level FPGA programming tool &#8211; Impulse CoDeveloper. Analysis of DSP application development in a hybrid CPU+FPGA system employing the high-level programming tool Impulse C is presented. Potential of the selected tool to deliver algorithm speed-ups is investigated using reference multi-channel correlator software. Particular attention is devoted to input/output (I/O) implementation, which is considered one of the most challenging problems in FPGA design development. This work delivers an I/O framework based on PCI Express interface for the proposed high-performance scalable DSP system. Using Stratix II GX PCI Express Development Board from Altera Corporation, a scalable and flexible communication approach for the multi-channel correlator is delivered. This framework can be adapted to perform other high-performance streaming DSP applications. The outcomes of this work are a multi-channel correlator developed in a reconfigurable environment with new design methodology and I/O framework with software control application. The outcomes are used to demonstrate the potential of implementing DSP applications in hybrid CPU + FPGA architecture and to discuss existing challenges and suggest possible solutions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High performance reconfigurable computing</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="subject">DSP</field><field name="subject">C to HDL</field><field name="subject">Correlation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/678</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comfort in adventure: the role of comfort, constraints and negotiation in recreational SCUBA diving</field><field name="creator">Dimmock, Kay</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the role of comfort in adventure leisure and in recreational SCUBA diving in particular.

The concept of comfort is then introduced, with attention given to what comfort means from a range of disciplines. Following this, the use of the term comfort in adventure, leisure and tourism research is reviewed. Divers&#8217; constraints to comfort are also briefly examined here in this introduction, to build understanding of how comfort can be experienced during adventure, and SCUBA diving. Leisure constraints-negotiation research is discussed briefly and linked to SCUBA diving experiences.

The former Australian Government&#8217;s long-term strategy document for tourism, the Tourism White Paper, has also identified cycling-related tourism as a potential contributor to strengthening competitive advantage for Australia with respect to tourism. However, little theory-driven research exists hitherto to guide decision-making regarding prudent provision of infrastructure and services to facilitate the development of cycling-related tourism, while little research exists that aids in our understanding of the travel behaviours and characteristics of bicycle tourists.The present study examined independent bicycle tourists in Australia using a generic model of whole tourism systems as a framework for analysis. The study employed a mixture of quantitative and qualitative techniques to explore the needs, preferences and behaviours of independent bicycle tourists. In addition, several conditions previously identified in applied literature as possible impediments to the development of independent bicycle tourism in Australia were examined.The results indicated that independent bicycle tourists&#8217; behaviours and thought processes regarding destination selection reflected those put forward in the broader literature addressing special interest tourism, in that the activity to be pursued is more prevalent in driving decision-making than the actual destination(s) to be visited. This was illustrated by the importance attached by the respondents to aspects that directly relate to a destination area&#8217;s capacity to support cycling, particularly the presence and quality of cycling infrastructure (specifically roads, paths, trails and signage), endowed resources (appealing natural scenery), supporting industries, and accessibility.Three conditions were confirmed as impediments to the development of independent bicycle tourism in Australia. These impediments included perceptions of cycling on Australian roads as a dangerous practice; perceptions that infrastructure to support independent bicycle touring in Australia is generally inadequate; and perceived difficulties associated with the carriage of bicycles on air, coach and rail services in Australia. This research also identified several limitations regarding the capacity of Leiper&#8217;s model of whole tourism systems to articulate tourist flows associated with independent bicycle tourism. These limitations specifically related to the way the tourist destination regions and transit routes elements are conceptually defined in the generic model. An adapted descriptive, theoretical model of whole tourism systems involving independent bicycle tourism was proposed. The adapted model incorporated a geographic &#8216;hierarchy of destinations&#8217; sub-system and also acknowledged two distinct forms of transit routes: those traversed between the traveller-generating region and the destination area; and those traversed within the destination area by bicycle.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bicycle tourism</field><field name="subject">cycle tourism</field><field name="subject">whole tourism systems</field><field name="subject">cycling</field><field name="subject">special interest tourism</field><field name="subject">adventure tourism</field><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/95</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Novel hydrogels for protein drug delivery</field><field name="creator">Mawad, Damia, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction: Embolic agents are used to block blood flow of hypervascular tumours, ultimately resulting in target tissue necrosis. However, this therapy is limited by the formation of new blood vessels within the tumour, a process known as angiogenesis. Targeting angiogenesis led to the discovery of anti-angiogenic factors, large molecular weight proteins that can block the angiogenic process. The aim of this research is development of poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) aqueous solutions that cross-link in situ to form a hydrogel that functions as an embolic agent for delivery of macromolecular drugs. Methods: PVA (14 kDa, 83% hydrolysed), functionalised by 7 acrylamide groups per chain, was used to prepare 10, 15, and 20wt% non-degradable hydrogels, cured by UV or redox initiation. Structural properties were characterised and the release of FITCDextran (20kDa) was quantified. Degradable networks were then prepared by attaching to PVA (83% and 98 % hydrolysed) ester linkages with an acrylate end group. The effect on degradation profiles was assessed by varying parameters such as macromer concentration, cross-linking density, polymer backbone and curing method. To further enhance the technology, radiopaque degradable PVA was synthesised, and degradation profiles were determined. Cell growth inhibition of modified PVA and degradable products were also investigated. Results: Redox initiation resulted in non-degradable PVA networks of well-controlled structural properties. Increasing the solid content from 10 to 20wt% prolonged the release time from few hours to ~ 2 days but had no effect on the percent release, with only a maximum release of 65% achieved. Ester attachment to the PVA allowed flexibility in designing networks of variable swelling behaviors and degradation times allowing ease of tailoring for specific clinical requirements. Synthesis of radiopaque degradable PVA hydrogels was successful without affecting the polymer solubility in water or its ability to polymerize by redox. This suggested that this novel hydrogel is a potential liquid embolic with enhanced X-ray visibility. Degradable products had negligible cytotoxicity.  Conclusion: Novel non-degradable and radiopaque degradable PVA hydrogels cured by redox initiation were developed in this research. The developed PVA hydrogels showed characteristics in vitro that are desirable for the in vivo application as release systems for anti-angiogenic factors.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug delivery systems</field><field name="subject">Drug targeting</field><field name="subject">Polymers in medicine</field><field name="subject">Drugs - Controlled release</field><field name="subject">Polymeric drug delivery systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on reading strategies in KSL class</field><field name="creator">Sim, Sang Min, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">In recent years, KSL (Korean as a second language) education has developed together with the rising status of Korea in the international community. In the context of KSL, the number of foreign students has increased dramatically by virtue of Korea??s growing status. Most learn the Korean language for academic purposes and successful reading is an important key to success in their academic setting.  The purpose of this study is to examine the types of reading strategies employed by intermediate KSL learners when reading Korean texts. The study also attempted to examine similarities and differences in the use of reading strategies according to the variables of gender, nationality, text genre, and reading proficiency and to investigate the results of data analysis by multiple research methods, namely, reading strategies questionnaires/follow up interviews, think aloud protocols, and diary studies.  The results of the study indicated that the participants employed all of the defined reading strategies. In particular, participants concentrated on dealing with cognitive strategies and support strategies. Furthermore, most participants employed ??focusing word?? strategy frequently owing to the effect of orthographic similarity. In addition, some participants used multiple reading strategies simultaneously rather than a particular single strategy to cope with a breakdown in comprehension. This study found no meaningful overall differences in strategy use according to the variables of gender, nationality, and text genre. However, skilful readers employed every reading strategy actively compared with less skilful readers with regard to the variable of proficiency. There were some discrepancies of results among multiple research methods. These differences are due to the characteristics of each research method. This finding suggested that in fact the multiple research methods serve to complement each other. Implications are discussed in relation to the significance of multiple research methods as well as the construction of KSL reading strategy training programs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reading.</field><field name="subject">Second language acquisition -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Korean language.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43889</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and numerical modelling of wave-induced current and wave transformation in presence of submerged breakwaters</field><field name="creator">Tajziehchi, Mojtaba, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Two dimensional experimental and numerical modeling of wave transmission and wave-induced current over detached submerged breakwaters has been carried out in this thesis.  Two preliminary 3D and a comprehensive series of 2D laboratory experiments have been conducted in the wave basin and 3 m wide wave flume. The preliminary 3D experimental tests qualitatively investigated the flow behavior behind a submerged breakwater and confirmed the validity of the 2D tests. The 2D laboratory tests examined wave breaking, reflection, transmission as well as wave-induced set-up and currents over submerged breakwater/reef structures.  Different approaches to experimental data processing are examined in producing reliable application of the 2D laboratory measurements. Sensitivity of wave transmission coefficient, wave-induced set-up and wave-induced discharge over submerged breakwaters to other dimensional and non-dimensional parameters are comprehensively investigated. Previously published analytical/experimental studies for predicting/calculating wave breaking, wave transmission, wave-induced set-up and current are discussed and compared with the present experimental results. Improved equations/models are presented.  Numerical modeling of the hydrodynamic effects of wave breaking and flow over a submerged breakwater is investigated using Delft3D. The capability of the Delft3D numerical model to simulate wave height transformation and wave-induced current over submerged breakwaters is provided. Four different approaches using combinations/options within the two main modules of Delft3D (SWAN and FLOW) are tested in the numerical simulations and the results are compared to the laboratory experimental data.

The optimised mix achieved a compressive strength at the age of 28 days of 70 and 58 MPa after initial curing at 70??C for 12 hours and at 23??C for 24 hours, respectively. The resultant Geopolymer has an amorphous aluminosilicate structure. Efflorescence and the potential risk of alkali-silica reaction for the Geopolymer used in this study are both very low.  The research confirmed that the Geopolymer concrete developed in this study is far superior to Portland cement concrete when exposed in a sulphuric acid environment. The standard immersion tests finally selected for this research were in 10% sulphuric acid for 56 days and in 1% sulphuric acid for one year. Geopolymer concrete samples retained their shape without softening though they experienced a mass loss of about 5% and a strength loss of some 30%. Portland cement concrete recorded a mass loss of some 40% in a 10% sulphuric acid for 28 days.  The penetration rate of sulphuric acid into the Geopolymer concrete was found to approximately follow Fick&#146;s first law of diffusion and a linear relationship between the neutralisation depth and the square root of immersion time (in day) was established.  The degradation processes of Geopolymer concrete in sulphuric acid environments were intensively studied. The first stage involved the preferential liberation of alkali ions. The tetrahedral aluminium in the Si-O-Al configuration was removed and converted to octahedral aluminium. Consequently, the original units of Si(1Al) degraded to a silica polymorph structure in the corroded Geopolymer, which continued to serve a cementitious role. In contrast, in the case of Portland cement concrete, the acid solution dissolved the hydration products of the cement paste.  The residual reaction products were found to be soft and have no structural strength. Geopolymers with alkaline activators of mixed sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate did not exhibit any cracking problems. Class F fly ash with low calcium content was found to be suitable for developing a Geopolymer binder able to withstand sulphuric acid attack.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fly ash.</field><field name="subject">Concrete.</field><field name="subject">Sulphuric acid.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Barriers to occupational noise management</field><field name="creator">Williams, Warwick Hamilton, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work undertook the examination of the perceived barriers that exist to the management of occupational noise exposure in the workplace. Exposure to excessive levels of noise results in cumulative damage to the hearing mechanism of the ear and a subsequent hearing loss. This hearing loss is permanent and does not recover over time.  Initially the conventional method of addressing or controlling noise exposure was through Hearing Conservation Programs and more recently through Occupational Noise Management Programs that take more of a risk management approach. However, the numbers of new hearing loss claims submitted through the various ???workcover??? and ???worksafe??? authorities in Australia continue to remain very high. Hearing loss claims rank within the top two in number of new claims each year.  The research conducted shows that there are four main barriers perceived by individuals that work against the institution of effective preventive action. These four main barriers in order of priority are hearing protectors, information, culture and management, and are themselves each composed of several lesser factors. Each of the barriers was examined more closely in an attempt to better understand how they operate and the potential to discover how they may be overcome.  To briefly summarise the main barriers: 1) Hearing protectors are uncomfortable, impede communication and are unpleasant to wear; 2) Individuals would like more information on noise reduction and for this information to be supplied by management;  3) workplace and management culture needs to be supportive of occupational health and safety in general and with the implementation of supportive preventive measures in particular; and 3) management needs to be seen to place importance on occupational health and safety in the workplace in general and the reduction of excessive noise in particular.  By being aware of the barriers and operation the design of future more effective intervention or better noise management programs should be possible.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Noise barriers.</field><field name="subject">Noise control.</field><field name="subject">Occupational health and safety -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular dynamics simulation of ODTMA-Montmorillonite and nylon 6 nanocomposites</field><field name="creator">Wang, Lei, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Polymer materials stand on a very significant position in the materials industry area. The presence of organoclay nanocomposites reinforces polymer materials on many properties like strength, tensile and so on. Most previous studies on the characteristics of organoclays and polymer nanocomposites were based on the experimental approaches such as XRD (X-ray Diffraction) and NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance). These methods have achieved successfully on the basic analysis of chains and layering structures of polymer nanocomposites. However, information on the molecular level cannot be provided by those approaches. MD (Molecular Dynamic) simulation method could be employed to develop further information on the molecular level about organoclays and interlayer structure polymer nanocomposites. In the research of ODTMA-MMT (Octadecyltrimethylammonium-Montmorillonite) organoclay simulation, we find that the strong layering behaviour of interlayer ODTMA molecules is present with the same minimum distance between nitrogen atoms and MMT surface in different T/O (Tetrahedral vs. Octahedral) ratio cases. Nitrogen atoms sit right above the corresponding hexagonal cavities, which is in agreement with the previous research. The interaction energy between surfactants and MMT clay will reach the lowest point when substitution ratio of tetrahedral and octahedral (T/O) is equal to 1:1. Moreover, MSD (Mean Square Displacement) and diffusion coefficient of different models under same CEC (Charge Exchange Capacity) condition are inverse ratio to the T/O proportion. In nylon6 polymer nanocomposites, sodium cations which exist originally in ensemble as charge balancer are absorbed much closer to MMT surface than the organic components in the nylon 6 ODTMA-MMT ensemble. Sodium atoms or nitrogen atoms in surfactants both have higher MSD and coefficients than those atoms  in the organic-modified clays. In the exfoliated nylon 6 ODTMA-MMT nanocomposites, pair correlation has been analysed instead of density profile. Layering packing structure is also shown through this analysis, which is also consistent with previous work.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nylon.</field><field name="subject">Molecular dynamics -- Computer simulation.</field><field name="subject">Nanocomposites (Materials) [proposed]</field><field name="subject">Polymer clay.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28065</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of the bipolar inline radiofrequency ablation device (ILRFA) in liver and kidney transection.</field><field name="creator">Yao, Peng, St. George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Surgical resection is the best option for both liver and kidney cancers, which providing the long term survival. However intraoperative blood loss can be a significant challenge, and is clearly associated with morbidity and mortality. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) precoagulation has been introduced into liver and kidney surgery. Promising results have already achieved in reduction of intraoperative blood loss. In this thesis, a detailed explanation on precoagulation by RFA has been given. Our group developed a novel bipolar multi-array RFA device ??? InLine (ILRFA). In this thesis, we have investigated the performance in a variety of fields. In the study of ILRFA-assisted laparoscopic liver resection, ILRFA was easily employed through a hand port and achieved significant decrease of blood loss compared to control group (p &lt; 0.05). In the liver trauma study, ILRFA produced a 63.88% reduction of blood loss in peripheral injury and 53.57% in central injury respectively. In postoperative evaluation of ILRFA-assisted liver resection, animals underwent an uneventful recovery, no complications occurred. Histological examination revealed a typical post RFA evolution. In ILRFA-assisted partial nephrectomy, the mean intraoperative blood loss 35 ?? 7 ml in the ILRFA and 152 ?? 94 ml in the control, a 77.0% reduction (P = 0.024). The mean blood loss per centimetre resection area was 2.09 ?? 1.41 ml/cm2 in the ILRFA compared with 12.79 ?? 1.68 ml/cm2 in controls, the reduction was 79.0% (P = 0.019). In ILRFAassisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, the mean intraoperative blood loss was 32 ?? 15 ml in the ILRFA and 187 ?? 69 ml in the control group, a 77.0% reduction (P = 0.043).

Compared to hardware-managed cache, SPM can be more efficient in performance, power and area cost, and has the added advantage of better time predictability. In this thesis, SPMs should be seen in a general context. For example, in stream processors, a software-managed stream register file is usually used to stage data to and from off-chip memory. In IBM's Cell architecture, each co-processor has a software-managed local store for keeping data and instructions.  SPM management is critical for SPM-based embedded systems. In this thesis, we propose two novel methodologies, the memory colouring methodology and the perfect colouring methodology, to place the static data aggregates such as arrays and structs of a program in SPM. Our methodologies are dynamic in the sense that some data aggregates can be swapped into and out of SPM during program execution. To this end, a live range splitting heuristic is introduced in order to create potential data transfer statements between SPM and off-chip memory.  The memory colouring methodology is a general-purpose compiler approach. The novelty of this approach lies in partitioning an SPM into a pseudo register file then generalising existing graph colouring algorithms for register allocation to colour data aggregates. In this thesis, a scheme for partitioning an SPM into a pseudo register file is introduced. This methodology is inter-procedural and therefore operates on the interference graph for the data aggregates in the whole program. Different graph colouring algorithms may give rise to different results due to live range splitting and spilling heuristics used. As a result, two representative graph colouring algorithms, George and Appel's iterative-coalescing and Park and Moon's optimistic-coalescing, are generalised and evaluated for SPM allocation.  Like memory colouring, perfect colouring is also inter-procedural. The novelty of this second methodology lies in formulating the SPM allocation problem as an interval colouring problem. The interval colouring problem is an NP problem and no widely-accepted approximation algorithms exist. The key observation is that the interference graphs for data aggregates in many embedded applications form a special class of superperfect graphs. This has led to the development of two additional SPM allocation algorithms. While differing in whether live range splits and spills are done sequentially or together, both algorithms place data aggregates in SPM based on the cliques in an interference graph. In both cases, we guarantee optimally that all data aggregates in an interference graph can be placed in SPM if the given SPM size is no smaller than the chromatic number of the graph.  We have developed two memory colouring algorithms and two perfect colouring algorithms for SPM allocation. We have evaluated them using a set of embedded applications. Our results show that both methodologies are efficient and effective in handling large-scale embedded applications. While neither methodology outperforms the other consistently, perfect colouring has yielded better overall results in the set of benchmarks used in our experiments. All these algorithms are expected to be valuable. For example, they can be made available as part of the same compiler framework to assist the embedded designer with exploring a large number of optimisation opportunities for a particular embedded application.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scratch-pad memory.</field><field name="subject">Compiler.</field><field name="subject">Embedded computer systems.</field><field name="subject">Memory management (Computer science)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of Darwinism and evolutionism in modern Greek literature: the case of Grigorios Xenopoulos</field><field name="creator">Zarimis, Maria, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">PROBLEMS INVESTIGATED:This thesis responds to a significant gap in modern Greek literary scholarship in relation to the Darwinian, post-Darwinian and other evolutionary theories and ideas in the works of Greek writers. My preliminary investigations show that there have been Greek writers who were influenced by Darwinian ideas. However, histories of modern Greek literature do not include Darwinism as a distinct influence in its own right, instead it only appears within the Greek naturalist school of the late 19th century; even when they discuss naturalist works influenced by evolutionary thought. This thesis primarily examines the Darwinian and post- Darwinian influence in select writings of Grigorios Xenopoulos in the period from 1900 to at least 1930. In doing so it attempts to reassess the status of these works and to argue for their importance in the context of other Greek and non-Greek literature.  PROCEDURES FOLLOWED: This thesis takes on a cross-disciplinary approach drawing on the histories of science and of literature, on the biological sciences and other sciences. So as to establish a context for Xenopoulos' work, I discuss the themes and issues associated with evolutionary ideas and draw on Greek and non-Greek writers from the 19th century first wave of Darwinism to the first decades of the twentieth century.  GENERAL RESULTS: I am able to document that while there appears to have been a general delay in the transmission of Darwinian ideas to Greek creative writers, certain themes in their writings arise, responding to Darwinism, which are common to those of non-Greek writers. While there are differences in the treatments of these themes amongst writers, there are a number of main issues which arise from them which include class, gender and race, and are shown to be important in Greek society at the time. In addition, the direct implications of Darwin's theory of evolution are debated in Greece by science and religion, and are discussed in the writings of Xenopoulos and his peers.  MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: My examination of responses to Darwinism by Xenopoulos in the context of other Greek and non-Greek writers aims, firstly, to emphasise the importance of Xenopoulos and his work as a key literary influence in Greek society at the time; and secondly, to play a part in bringing modern Greek literature into the mainstream of European culture. The responses to Darwinism in literature, fiction and non-fiction, past and present, encompass a fascinating and controversial field of investigation which, in view of our scientific knowledge today, continues to address issues such as the nature-nurture debate, creationism versus evolution and man's place in nature. Hence it is important that literary responses to the Darwinism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Greece be documented as a foundation for present literary responses.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Greek literature.</field><field name="subject">Xenopoulos, Gr&#275;gorios, 1867-1951.</field><field name="subject">Evolution (Biology) in literature.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43897</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stability of thin-walled metal tubes with elastic uni-lateral internal restraint.</field><field name="creator">Roufegarinejad, Ali, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a theoretical study into the behaviour of thin-walled metal tubes that are filled with elastic material. The study has considered the behaviour and design of concrete-filled steel columns by analysing the effect of the combined actions of axial compression and bending on closed stainless steel cross-sections with a concrete infill as well as the elastic buckling of square, circular and elliptical thin-walled steel tubes, when filled with elastic material. The elastic local buckling of a rectangular plate having four edges clamped and subjected to in-plane linearly varying uniaxial loading with and without juxtaposition with a rigid infill has also been studied. Concrete-filled composite columns find widespread use globally in engineering structures because of their optimal strength and ease of construction. Enhancing the strength of filled columns by utilising newer materials such as stainless steel or shape memory alloys for the skin of the cross-section of the column will increase the construction cost of the column. In order to circumvent this increased construction cost, or to minimise it, the metal skin should be as thin as possible. Members with thin-walled cross-section are prone to lateral torsional buckling, and in particular they are prone to local buckling, with the latter buckling mode playing an important role in the strength of a composite column with a concrete infill. The local buckling coefficient is enhanced by the provision of a rigid concrete infill, and efficient design must make use of this fact to minimise the cost of the skin. The initial portions of this thesis demonstrate the beneficial effects that the rigid concrete core has on the overall strength, and also on the local buckling behaviour of thin-walled metal tubes. The local buckling of the metal skin has been modelled in this thesis by using a Ritz-based energy method. In bi-lateral and uni-lateral buckling studies of rectangular plates, a more general trigonometric function has been selected by application of boundary conditions to the chosen shape function, with these boundary conditions being implemented to make the chosen shape function satisfy the edge conditions for the problem under consideration. The restraining medium is modelled as a tensionless foundation and this restraint condition is introduced through a penalty method formulation. Extensive comparative, convergence, and parametric studies have been carried out by considering a wide range of uni-laterally constrained plates. Following a concise review of the available literature, techniques for analysing the elastic local buckling of thin-walled square tubes, fully filled with elastic materials and subjected to concentric uni-axial compression, are formulated by means of a simple stiffness approach and a proper Ritz-based technique. This method is then extended to account for the local buckling of thin-walled circular and elliptical cylinders with elastic infill. By representation of a proper trigonometric displacement function in the formulation which is capable of incorporating the effects of the penetration zone in a harmonic form, in addition to satisfying all the necessary boundary conditions, it is shown that the buckling solution reduces to a dimensionless representation for which the relevant geometrical and material properties that govern the local buckling coefficient can be identified. It was found that the provision of lightweight and low density infill is functional and attractive with respect to an increase in the efficacy of the restraint. A comparison was made, and good agreement was found to exist, between the results obtained from this study and results that are available in the literature. Finally, a strength to weight index is introduced that quantifies the enhancement in the local buckling coefficient for a number of materials with a wide range of stiffness and density. This index has potential applications for optimal design in aerospace and other specialized engineering applications.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thin-walled structures.</field><field name="subject">Buckling (Mechanics) -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43904</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Retroviral transfer of BCR-ABL Ribozyme sequences to primary human chronic myeloid leukaemia cells</field><field name="creator">Presgrave, Peter John, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML) is a clonal haemopoietic stem cell (HSC) disorder characterised by the presence of a disease-specific gene, BCR-ABL, which leads to the production of a bcr-abl mRNA transcript. CML is an ideal candidate for gene therapy using ribozymes (Rz), catalytic RNA molecules that cleave and inactivate target RNA in a sequence specific manner. Limited data is available on the activity of ribozymes in human CML cells. In this study, hammerhead ribozyme sequences directed against the b3a2 bcr-abl mRNA sequence (Rz6-Rz10) were cloned into several retroviral vectors. Initial experiments using MSCVHSA based retroviral constructs failed to express the sequences in cell lines. Rz cDNA fragments were then cloned into an LNL6 based retroviral vector (LGL1) encoding a GFP reporter gene and stable LGLRz constructs produced.  Using cell sorting, high-titre PA317 producer cell line clones were isolated. Transcriptional silencing of the LGLRz6 producer cell line occurred with prolonged culture, with partial reversal on treatment with the demethylating agent 5' azacytidine. To assess the activity of these constructs in human cells, CD34+ HSC were isolated from newly diagnosed b3a2 Ph+ CML patients. Cells were transduced with either control LGL vector or the LGLRz6 construct. Transduced human cells were sorted based on GFP expression and placed into long-term HSC culture (LTC-IC assays). Using a common cDNA, RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of both the transgene and bcr-abl in individual colonies derived from the LTCIC assay at various time points, allowing assessment of the effect of transgene expression on bcr-abl expression. LGLRz transgene expression was detectable for up to 6 weeks in culture. Colony RT-PCR results from 3 patients showed that expression of the LGLRz6 construct was associated with decreased bcr-abl expression. It also appeared that the reduced bcr-abl expression decreased the proliferation of Ph+ cells leading to their loss from culture. In summary, these results appear to show an effect of a retroviral vector containing a bcr-abl Rz sequence on human CML HSC. Targeting of bcr-abl remains a valid therapeutic goal in the Imatinib era, particularly if problems related to effective ribozyme delivery and targeting can be overcome.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Myeloid leukemia.</field><field name="subject">Catalytic RNA.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crimes of exclusion: the Australian state???s responses to unauthorised migrants.</field><field name="creator">Grewcock, Michael, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a criminological perspective on the Australian state???s responses to unauthorised migrants. In particular, it attempts to build on recent criminological literature on state crime by contrasting the alleged deviance of unauthorised migrants with the organised and deviant human rights abuses perpetrated by the Australian state. The main argument of the thesis is that through the systematic alienation, criminalisation and abuse of unauthorised migrants, particularly refugees, the Australian state is engaged in state crime. While this can partly be measured by breaches of international humanitarian law, the acts in question are criminal according to the broader sociological understanding of state crime as ???state organisational deviance involving the violation of human rights???. The thesis develops this argument by locating the phenomena of forced and illicit migration within an increasingly globalised world economy in which the needs for international human migration are confronted by the restrictive migration policies of the dominant Western states. In this context, the Australian state has played a pivotal role in the development of three major Western exclusion zones, which are designed to contain unauthorised migrants in the developing world and are enforced by measures that systematically abuse human rights. The fundamental criminological dynamic of the Australian exclusion zone is its systematic assault on the movements and by definition, the rights, of forced migrants. This operates at a number of levels: unauthorised arrivals are alienated by their lack of legal status; they are denied access to a full refugee determination process; their status as refugees is subordinated to that of the resettled refugee; their experiences are denied and delegitimised through their construction as queue jumpers; they are criminalised through their participation in smuggling enterprises; they are punished and abused through the use of detention, dispersal and forced removal; and they are put at greater personal risk by the measures employed to enforce the zone. The thesis traces the development of this zone from the formation of the white Australia policy through to the Pacific Solution and critically analyses the ways in which current policy draws on and reinforces the exclusionist traditions of Australian nationalism.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Refugees -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Forced migration.</field><field name="subject">Human rights.</field><field name="subject">Humanitarian law.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct shear behaviour of steel fibres in a cementitious matrix.</field><field name="creator">Lee, Gregory G, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">An experimental investigation into the direct shear behaviour of steel fibre reinforced composites utilising discrete fibres at pre-defined angles and fibres randomly distributed is described. The direct shear tests encompassed the complete range of loading from its initial application to failure of the double L-shaped push-off specimens. Hooked-ended and straight steel fibres were used in the tests with the fibres oriented at angles of ??75??, ??60??, ??45??, ??30??, ??15?? and 0?? with respect to a plane normal to the loading direction. The embedment lengths of the fibres, related to the total fibre length lf , each side of the shear plane were 0.5lf :0.5lf and 0.25lf :0.75lf . In addition to the single fibre tests, tests were conducted on randomly oriented steel fibre reinforced composites with fibre volumes of 0.005, 0.010, 0.015, and 0.020 with hooked-ended and straight steel fibres.  In addition to the tests outlined above, a series of non-destructive tests employing radiographic techniques was carried out to produce photographic images of events taking place of fibres pulling out from a cementitious element. The tests consisted of hooked-ended steel fibres oriented at angles of -60??, -30??, 0??, +30?? and +60?? to the cracking plane and straight fibres oriented at angles of -60??, 0?? and +60??. The non destructive technique allowed the internal behaviour occurring within the specimen along the shear plane to be investigated without impacting on the direct shear tests.  The angle of the fibre to the interface plane is an important parameter in determining the behaviour of the fibres under load and for the mode of failure; viz fibre pullout or fibre fracture. The effect of the end hook on behavioural aspects becomes increasingly less significant for more acute fibre angles where bending and snubbing effects become increasingly influential on the load versus displacement behaviour and mode of failure.  Contrary to expectations, the fibre embedment length had little influence over the peak loads attained for the discrete fibre tests and, in a number of specimens, fibres pulled out from the longer embedded side. This observation is contrary to the generally accepted assumption that a fibre remains rigidly embedded on the long side and pulls out from short side. The traditional role that uniform bond stresses along a fibre length and friction have played in the description of fibre behaviour is not as significant as previously reported, other effects such as snubbing are more important in anchoring a fibre. Various models need to be revised with this observation in mind.  The experimental results and observations from the discrete hooked-ended and straight steel fibres investigation are incorporated in the development of a behavioural model, the Variable Engagement Model II (VEMII). The VEMII describes the behaviour of randomly oriented discontinuous steel fibre reinforced composites loaded in shear. The model is verified against a series of randomly distributed fibre reinforced mortar specimens carried out in this study. Two forms of models are analysed: 1) a model based on the observation of lumped shear stresses at the fibre hook and in the snubbing zone; and 2) a uniform fibre bond stress applied along the embedded part of the fibre. The lumped bond stress approach and the uniform approach were found to give reasonable comparisons with the test data for the hooked-ended fibres but were conservative for the straight fibres. The VEMII confirms the applicability of the uniform bond approach adopted by previous researchers even though it does not correspond to the observations of fibre pullout behaviour of single fibres. The VEMII model provides a versatile approach that can also be applied to hybrid fibre combinations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shear (Mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Fibers.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social capital, women's agency and the VIEW clubs of Australia.</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Christie, Social Science &amp; Policy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Contemporary debates about collective action in civil society have given prominent place to the connections between voluntary associations and social capital.  Social capital research, however, commonly over-emphasises the role of associations in generating societal-level outcomes, to the neglect of the specific contexts in which associations reside and the different opportunities individuals and groups have to access resources for and through collective action.  Also largely ignored are considerations of gender.  This thesis addresses these issues, presenting evidence from a case study of a large women???s service organisation ??? the VIEW Clubs of Australia ??? to examine how social capital and women???s agency intersect. The thesis adopts a social-structural approach to social capital, highlighting its role as a resource brokered through networks that both enable and constrain action.  This approach attends to the inter-relations of particular types of social capital, such as bonding and bridging; specific elements of social capital, such as reciprocity, trust, and shared values, identities and purposes; and addresses the  broader socio-historical context in which social capital networks are located. The thesis employs a model of agency that encompasses three core fields of agency ??? individual, social and political.  These fields of agency encapsulate the capacity for women to ???act??? and exercise choice and change in their own lives, in the community, and in the polity, and to do this through collective action.  The thesis applies these ideas using an embedded case study model combining documentary analysis, participant observation and in-depth interviews. The findings reveal agency and social capital to be in tension.  Activities that feed the agential capacity of the organisation and its members are more successfully realised in areas closest to women???s past experiences than in those addressing the public sphere.  The research nevertheless shows that a voluntary association such as VIEW can foster women???s agency.  Indeed, building women???s capacities in society as a whole may well rely on organisational contexts where women are empowered to self-develop and connect their activities to broader society.  This is impacted by the nature, purpose, and social location of the social capital networks of women and others, and has implications for how we understand the ongoing role of voluntary associations in civil society.  By revealing how different dimensions of social capital operate and intersect with women???s agency, the thesis shows the dynamic role of voluntary associations in civil society.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social capital (Sociology) -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Agency.</field><field name="subject">Civil society -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The function of ideas of reason in Kant???s political philosophy.</field><field name="creator">Keating, Paula, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the power of ideas in political philosophy and practice. It argues firstly that Kant???s ideas of reason, as he originally defines them as regulative in the First Critique, play an important role in his political philosophy and his dynamic approach to politics. Secondly, because it is fundamentally concerned with political transition and improvement, Kant???s approach to politics is therefore one that has continuing relevance. Evidence for this is provided via an examination of Rawls??? political liberalism and the manner in which the idea of the reasonable fulfils the role of an idea of reason. The thesis begins with an examination of the regulative use of ideas of reason in the Dialectic of the First Critique: the ideas of soul, world and God become guides for practice, insofar as they are not bearers of truth but instead create essential conditions necessary for human life and meaning. Chapter Two then demonstrates how ideas of reason figure in Kant???s political texts. They condition politics by inspiring the practice of their objects, for example, the establishment of a rightful condition, the security of private property, the perpetuation of peace. That they look to the status quo in order to effect politics, demonstrates their concern with social progress. Chapter Three argues that publicity forms the primary political idea of reason as it enables the polity to use ideas of reason. Because publicity provides the test of efficient and rightful politics, we can say that it is through publicity that Kant???s politics is grounded. Chapter Four investigates Rawls??? political liberalism and observes that the primacy of the idea of the reasonable in his theory works according to a system of ideas of reason as proposed by Kant. Chapter Five then makes a final comparison between Kant and Rawls to demonstrate that ideas of reason, in particular the pre-eminent political idea of public reason, is central to both their conceptions of the political condition.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reason.</field><field name="subject">Political science.</field><field name="subject">Kant, Immanuel, 1724-1804.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an integrated approach to understanding, managing and designing strategies and recycled organics filtration treatment system to control regional heavy metal contamination of stormwater.</field><field name="creator">Seelsaen, Nida, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Urban stormwater runoff is recognised as a substantial source of heavy metal contamination, which adversely impacts on water quality of regional receiving waterways. Conventional treatment of urban runoff mostly involves a filtration system using sand to retain particulate matters. Sand provides limited sorption of dissolved metals and the inclusion of commercial sorbents to these treatment systems is not cost effective due to the concentration of dissolved metals in the runoff. Recycled organic materials are by-products or waste from industrial or agricultural operations, and could be alternative low cost sorbents for stormwater treatment systems. The use of recycled sorbents also provides added value to the waste materials and reduces landfill disposal.            The research explores the application of compost, zeolite, ash, and recyclable waste in urban runoff treatment, especially for dissolved metal removal. The research combines the two aspects of experimental studies and management analysis to develop a holistic approach to heavy metal control in urban stormwater systems. Experimental results of batch sorption test show that compost is suitable for removing dissolve copper in stormwater treatment. The comparison of the different mixing ratios between compost and glass beads in column test evaluates the optimum mixing sorbent and performance over a long period for copper removal. Substance Flow Analysis (SFA) of copper has been performed in the Upper Parramatta River Catchment, Sydney to identify the sources of copper associated with runoff, effect of using waste material such as compost in urban stormwater treatment and the copper load in urban stormwater runoff. This case study shows the relationship between copper input, copper stock, sorbent type and urban stormwater quality control in the system boundary of the catchment. Different scenarios of source control are evaluated to control copper load from the different sources. Source control focusing on roads and vehicles is the most effective copper control strategy. The combination of source control and stormwater treatment reduces copper in stormwater and receiving water. The thesis applies the analysis from SFA and experimental results to derive both a regional system-wide solution with source control, and an improved design of stormwater treatment for heavy metal removal using recycled organics.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heavy metals.</field><field name="subject">Stormwater infiltration.</field><field name="subject">Compost.</field><field name="subject">Runoff.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanical properties of 7075 aluminium matrix composites reinforced by nanometric silicon carbide particulates</field><field name="creator">Ren, Zheng , Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Aluminium composites reinforced by particles have received considerable attention because of their superior mechanical properties over monolithic aluminum matrix. Over the last ten years, nanocomposites with nano-sized reinforcements have become a revolutionary progress for composites because they have different strengthening mechanisms as compared to that in composites with micro-sized reinforcements. Consequently novel properties can be expected from the nanometric particulate reinforced composites. The aim of this project was to fabricate SiC (50nm)/7075 aluminium composites via a modified powder metallurgy and extrusion route. Ageing treatment was used to increase the strength of the composites and mechanical tests, including tensile test and abrasive wear test, were performed. The effects of nanometric silicon carbide particulates to the ageing behaviours and mechanical properties of the composites have been studied by optical metallography, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. It was found that the dispersion of nanometric silicon carbide was not homogeneous, but tended to disperse along grain boundaries. Clustering of these nano-reinforcements was also found within the grains. This was particular true when the amount of nano-reinforcement increased to 5%. Compared with the monolithic 7075 alloy, the 1 vol.% SiC (50nm)/7075 aluminium had a higher strength because of effective dislocation pinnings by the reinforcements, while 5% SiC (50nm)/7075 had a much lower strength and ductility because of severe aggregation of nanometric particulates. Nanometric silicon carbide was not as effective as the micro ones in improving abrasive wear resistance of aluminium, this was because of micro-cracking in the aggregation and relatively large abrasive grit. In summary, the addition of a small amount of SiC nanoreinforcements has a high potential to further strengthen 7xxx aluminium alloy. However, the clustering of reinforcements in the matrix will detrimentally affect the strength and ductility of the alloy. The wear resistance of nanometric particulate reinforced composites was inferior to those with micrometric reinforcements. It is suggested that by improving the dispersion of nanometric reinforcements, as well as putting in reinforcememts with different sizes, the mechanical properties and wear resistance can both be increased.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aluminum.</field><field name="subject">Silicon carbide.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/34742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of gas-solid flow and thermal behaviour in an ironmaking blast furnace</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Zongyan, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The ironmaking blast furnace (BF) remains the most significant and important process for the production of liquid iron. For the achievement of stable furnace operation and good performance, mathematical modellings at different levels increasingly become a powerful tool in developing better understanding of this multiphase flow system, in particular the gas-solid flow. This thesis represents an effort in this area. A simplified and continuum-based mathematical model is proposed and tested to predict the BF gas-solid flow at a macroscopic level. The results show that the simple model is able to predict the general features of the solid flow, including the effects of gas and solid flowrates, and materials properties. The simplified model can be readily implemented in a full process model that needs to have a quick response to change for the purpose of control and optimization. To overcome the difficulties encountered in continuum modelling, i.e. determination of constitutive correlations, and particularly the description of the stagnant zone when related to BF, a discrete model based on the coupling approach of discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is then employed to investigate the gas-solid flow in a model BF at a microscopic level. The results confirm the effects of variables such as gas flow rate, solid flow rate, particle properties, and model types. More importantly, such an approach can generate abundant microscopic information such as flow structure (particle velocity, porosity, coordination number) and force structure, which are of paramount importance to elucidate the gas-solid flow mechanisms, and develop a more comprehensive understanding of BF gas-solid flow, such as the formation mechanism of the stagnant zone. Further, the transient gas-solid flow phenomena, together with the considerations of cohesive zones and hearth liquid, can be predicted. Further, in order to develop understanding of thermal behaviour and elucidate the heat transfer mechanisms occurring in particle-fluid flow system, a new model is proposed by extending the DEM-CFD, and then tested in gas fluidization. The model considers the three heat transfer modes, and demonstrates its ability in investigating the heat transfer mechanisms, and offers an effective method to elucidate the mechanisms governing the heat transfer in particle-fluid systems at a particle scale. It is recommended to apply to the study of BF thermal behaviour.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blast furnaces -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Heat -- Transmission.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35214</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Meeting the ageing aircraft challenge</field><field name="creator">Crowley, Christopher Keith, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">&amp;quotMeeting the ageing aircraft challenge&amp;quot is not just about safety, not just about effectiveness, and not just about economy of support. It is about proactive and reactive optimization of all three service goals throughout long life cycles that span 20 or 30 years, or more, and typically, beyond the originally intended design life.  It is therefore about organizational attitudes towards ongoing trend analysis and condition monitoring, and pervading cost benefit assessments of all forms of human innovation across what the author describes as 'the eight sustaining disciplines for long aerospace life cycles', including scientific and technological developments, and opportunities for reliability growth or 'refresh'. Complacency is the root cause of all problems with the design, maintenance and support of all modern infrastructure, and therefore life cycle planners and minders are required to be an enthusiastic but nervous lot - always hoping for the best, but planning for the worst impact of 'Mr Murphy'. Murphy thrives on complacency, is in bed with uncertainty, and never forgets (as we do often) that imperfection (no matter how small) breeds unreliability traps that patiently wait to surprise at some stage along the life cycle journey. He has the upper hand.  ...Our best weapons against Murphy are continual, total picture and longer-term situational awareness; caution, vigilance, innovation and collaboration.  This research study and thesis is intended as a broad and comprehensive management philosophy, a guide and checklist - a broad scrape of everything 'so deep', rather than coverage of any one-niche aspect of the ageing aircraft challenge in great depth. It includes a brief and simple strategic setting for Australian Military Aerospace requirements, and spans a three axes management philosophy: 1. a toolbox of eight sustaining disciplines, 2. trend analysis and 3. time-cost-benefit assessment.  Along with complacency, the prime ageing aircraft 'killers' are identified, as are the key ageing aircraft 'age multipliers'. The eight sustaining disciplines are explained in varying depth, according to their broad significance to the ageing aircraft condition and life cycle. The ever-ubiquitous bathtub reliability curve - the key to understanding, predicting and controlling life cycle behaviour (including costs) - is emphasized.  Engineering life cycle minding and capability management are broad focus areas. The eight areas of attention identified for this broad study are:  1.	  Aerospace design requirements and trends, 2.	  Science and technology opportunities, 3.	  Airworthiness, engineering and maintenance philosophy, 4.	  Reliability behaviour, 5.	  Operational use and abuse patterns, 6.	  Logistics support and managing obsolescence, 7.	  Technical workforce and organizational attitudes (requirements and outlook), and 8.	  Life cycle costing and budgeting. This thesis primarily draws attention to the fundamental driver of life cycle behaviour - reliability. The critical dependency that life cycle control and prediction has on consistent and high quality trend data collection and analysis is emphasized throughout, and the now pressing need for better identification of ageing aircraft cost growth drivers, and their containment, is linked to reliability trend awareness, manipulation and intervention. The human dimension is included - including coverage of organizational attitudes and what it takes to be a 'high reliability organization'.  There are no magic or easy answers to the ageing aircraft condition and challenge. Trend analysis has to be done from the bottom up, system by system, for each fleet type. But over time, with consistent trend data collection, patterns emerge within the sophisticated and stochastic systems behaviour that that ageing aircraft play out. These patterns enable ongoing management of the long life cycle to be more confidently predicted, more assured and with best possible cost growth containment. The best, perhaps only, path to least surprises and best cost containment is now being re-identified in some military aviation organizations as a mature and evolving RAM engineering and RCM framework. RAM-RCM may well be the only recovery from what some admit is a death spiral of ageing aircraft cost growth.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Royal Australian Air Force</field><field name="subject">airplanes</field><field name="subject">Military</field><field name="subject">life cycle costing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38679</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of residual atmospheric delay in the low latitude regions using network-based GPS positioning</field><field name="creator">Musa, Tajul Ariffin, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The atmosphere in low latitude regions is of particular interest to GPS researchers because the propagation of GPS signals becomes significantly delayed compared with other regions of the world. Hence this limits GPS positioning accuracy in equatorial regions. Although the atmospheric delay can be modelled, a residual component will still remain. Reducing, or mitigating the effect of residual atmospheric delay is of great interest, and remains a challenge, especially in equatorial regions. Analysis of relative positioning accuracy of GPS baselines has confirmed that the residual atmospheric delay is distance-dependent, even in low latitude areas. Residual ionospheric delay is the largest component in terms of both absolute magnitude and variability. However it can be largely eliminated by forming the ionosphere-free combination of measurements made on two frequencies. The residual tropospheric delay is smaller in magnitude but rather problematic due to strong spatio-temporal variations of its wet component. Introducing additional troposphere ???scale factors??? in the least squares estimation of relative position can reduce the effect of the residual. In a local GPS network, the distance-dependent errors can be spatially modelled by network-based positioning. The network-based technique generates a network ???correction??? for user positioning. The strategy is to partition this network correction into dispersive and non-dispersive components. The latter can be smoothed in order to enhance the ionosphere-free combination, and can be of benefit to ambiguity resolution. After this step, both the dispersive and non-dispersive correction components can be used in the final positioning step. Additional investigations are conducted for stochastic modelling of network-based positioning. Based on the least squares residuals, the variance-covariance estimation technique can be adapted to static network-based positioning. Moreover, a two-step procedure can be employed to deal with the temporal correlation in the measurements. Test results on GPS networks in low latitude and mid-latitude areas have demonstrated that the proposed network-based positioning strategy works reasonably well in resolving the ambiguities, assisting the ambiguity validation process and in computing the user???s position. Furthermore, test results of stochastic modelling in various GPS networks suggests that there are improvements in validating the ambiguity resolution results and handling the temporal correlation, although the positioning result do not differ compared to using the simple stochastic model typically used in standard baseline processing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GPS receivers.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39963</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silicon quantum dot superlattices in dielectric matrices: SiO2, Si3N4 and SiC</field><field name="creator">Cho, Young Hyun, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Silicon quantum dots (QDs) in SiO2 superlattices were fabricated by alternate deposition of silicon oxide (SiO2) and silicon-rich oxide (SRO), i.e. SiOx (x&lt;2), and followed by high temperature annealing. A deposited SRO film is thermodynamically unstable below 1173oC and phase separation and diffusion of Si atoms in the amorphous SiO2 matrix creates nano-scaled Si quantum dots. The quantum-confined energy gap was measured by static photoluminescence (PL) using an Argon ion laser operating at 514.5 nm. The measured energy band gaps of crystalline Si QDs in SiO2 matrix at room temperature (300 K) show that the emission energies from 1.32 eV to 1.65 eV originating Si dot sizes from 6.0 nm to 3.4 nm, respectively. There is a strong blue-shift of the PL energy peak position with decreasing the quantum dot size and this shows the evidence of quantum confinement of our fabricated Si QDs in SiO2 matrix. The PL results indicate that the fabricated Si QDs in SiO2 matrix could be suitable for the device application such as top cell material for all-silicon tandem solar cells. Silicon QD superlattices in nitride matrix were fabricated by alternate deposition of silicon nitride (Si3N4) and silicon-rich nitride (SRN) by PECVD or co-sputtering of Si and Si3N4 targets. High temperature furnace annealing under a nitrogen atmosphere was required to form nano-scaled silicon quantum dots in the nitride matrix. The band gap of silicon QD superlattice in nitride matrix (3.6- 7.0 nm sized dots) is observed in the energy range of 1.35- 1.98 eV. It is about 0.3- 0.4 eV blue-shifted from the band gap of the same sized quantum dots in silicon oxide. It is believed that the increased band gap is caused by a silicon nitride passivation effect.  Silicon-rich carbide (SRC, i.e. Si1-xCx) thin films with varying atomic ratio of the Si to C were fabricated by using magnetron co-sputtering from a combined Si and C or SiC targets. Off-stoichiometric Si1-xCx is of interest as a precursor to realize Si QDs in SiC matrix, because it is thermodynamically metastable when the composition fraction is in the range 0 &lt; x &lt; 0.5. Si nanocrystals are therefore able to precipitate during a post-annealing process. SiC quantum dot superlattices in SiC matrix were fabricated by alternate deposition of thin layers of carbon-rich silicon carbide (CRC) and SRC using a layer by layer deposition technique. CRC layers were deposited by reactive co-sputtering of Si and SiC targets with CH4. The PL energy band gap (2.0 eV at 620 nm) from 5.0 nm SRC layers could be from the nanocrystalline ??-SiC with Si-O bonds and the PL energy band gap (1.86 eV at 665 nm) from 6.0 nm SRC layers could be from the nanocrystalline ??-SiC with amorphous SiC clusters, respectively. The dielectric material for an all-silicon tandem cell is preferably silicon oxide, silicon nitride or silicon carbide. It is found that for carrier mobility, dot spacing for a given Bloch mobility is in the order: SiC &gt; Si3N4 &gt; SiO2. By ab-initio simulation and PL results, the band gap for a given dot size is in the order: SiC &gt; Si3N4 &gt; SiO2. However, the PL intensity for a given dot size is in the order: SiC &lt; Si3N4 &lt; SiO2.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Silicon solar cells.</field><field name="subject">Quantum dots.</field><field name="subject">Superlattices.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40172</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterising the uncertainty in potential large rapid changes in wind power generation</field><field name="creator">Cutler, Nicholas Jeffrey, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wind energy forecasting can facilitate wind energy integration into a power system. In particular, the management of power system security would benefit from forecast information on plausible large, rapid change in wind power generation. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems are presently the best available tools for wind energy forecasting for projection times between 3 and 48 hours. In this thesis, the types of weather phenomena that cause large, rapid changes in wind power in southeast Australia are classified using observations from three wind farms. The results show that the majority of events are due to horizontal propagation of spatial weather features. A study of NWP systems reveals that they are generally good at forecasting the broad large-scale weather phenomena but may misplace their location relative to the physical world. Errors may result from developing single time-series forecasts from a single NWP grid point, or from a single interpolation of proximate grid points. This thesis presents a new approach that displays NWP wind forecast information from a field of multiple grid points around the wind farm location. Displaying the NWP wind speeds at the multiple grid points directly would potentially be misleading as they each reflect the estimated local surface roughness and terrain at a particular grid point. Thus, a methodology was developed to convert the NWP wind speeds at the multiple grid points to values that reflect surface conditions at the wind farm site. The conversion method is evaluated with encouraging results by visual inspection and by comparing with an NWP ensemble. The multiple grid point information can also be used to improve downscaling results by filtering out data where there is a large chance of a discrepancy between an NWP time-series forecast and observations. The converted wind speeds at multiple grid points can be downscaled to site-equivalent wind speeds and transformed to wind farm power assuming unconstrained wind farm operation at one or more wind farm sites. This provides a visual decision support tool that can help a forecast user assess the possibility of large, rapid changes in wind power from one or more wind farms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Numerical weather prediction</field><field name="subject">Uncertainty</field><field name="subject">Wind power forecasting</field><field name="subject">Numerical weather prediction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43570</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene profiling in soft tissue sarcoma: predictive value of EGFR in sarcoma tumour progression and survival</field><field name="creator">Das Gupta, Paromita, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite improvements in the clinical management of soft tissue sarcomas (STS), 50% of patients will die of metastatic disease that is largely unresponsive to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. The aims of this study were to identify genes and pathways that are dysregulated in progressive and metastatic STS. In addition to this, cell lines from fresh tumours were initiated and established, thus increasing the repository of cell lines available for functional studies. Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular biology of STS have thus far not resulted in the use of molecular markers for clinical prognostication. Identifying novel genes and pathways will lead to molecular diagnostic methods to better stratify prognostic groups and could identify cellular targets for more efficacious treatments. Gene expression profiling of sarcoma cell lines of increasing metastatic potential revealed over-expression of genes involved in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) pathways. Factors involved in invasion and metastasis such as integrins and MMPs were over-expressed in the cell lines with higher metastatic potential. The developmental Notch pathway and cell cycle regulators were also dysregulated. NDRG1 was significantly over-expressed in the high grade sarcoma cell line, a novel finding in sarcomas. The expression of EGFR, NDRG1 and other genes from the above pathways was validated using quantitative RT-PCR in real time (qRT-PCR). A tissue microarray (TMA) comprising STS of varying tumour grades was constructed for high throughput assessment of target proteins. EGFR, its activated form and its signal transducers were investigated using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Activated EGFR (HR 2.228, p &lt; 0.001) and phosphorylated Akt (HR 2.032, p = 0.003) were found to be independent predictors of overall survival and both correlated with tumour grade. Of the several STS cultures initiated and maintained, two of these cell lines were fully characterised in terms of cytogenetics, telomerase and alternate lengthening of 5 telomeres (ALT) status, KIT and TP53 mutation and the expression of certain biomarkers using both qRT-PCR and IHC. In summary, transcript profiling identified several potential biomarkers of tumour progression and metastasis in STS. Crucially, activated EGFR and pAkt were found in a cohort of STS samples to correlate with clinical outcome, identifying them as potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets in the treatment of STS. Activated EGFR can be used as a diagnostic marker for patient selection, as well as for target effect monitoring. Furthermore, the cell lines established in this project will serve as valuable tools in future preclinical studies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Activated EGFR</field><field name="subject">soft tissue sarcoma</field><field name="subject">EGFR</field><field name="subject">gene expression profiling</field><field name="subject">tissue microarray</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The utilisation of quantitative information in groups' capital investment decisions</field><field name="creator">Ang, Nicole Pamela, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">One explanation for the increased use of interactive groups in organisations is that benefits are obtained from pooling individuals?? differing knowledge and abilities.  However, prior experimental research has established that groups often do not discuss and use information effectively, exhibiting a bias toward information that is commonly known by all group members, rather than information that is unique to individual group members (common information bias).  This dissertation investigated whether the provision of quantitative information resulted in improved group performance in two respects.  First, it investigated whether quantitative information was discussed and used more than qualitative information.  Second, it examined whether the quantification of information reduced the common information bias.  This is important because a basic purpose of managerial accounting is to provide information that improves employees?? abilities to make optimal decisions. This dissertation utilised an experimental task known as a ??hidden profile?? to achieve the research objectives.  In a hidden profile experiment, each group member receives some information that is common to everyone in the group, and some information that is unique to them.  The group must discuss and use members?? unique information in order to uncover the optimal task solution.  This dissertation examined the effect of information availability (common or unique) and information type (quantitative or qualitative) on information discussion and use.  There were two stages to the experiment.  First, individual group members had to make a capital investment decision, and write down their reasons for that decision.  Second, groups had to discuss the information, come to a group decision, and write down their reasons for that decision. The results confirmed a common information bias at the group decision level, with groups significantly favouring common information over unique information, for all measures of discussion and information use.  In contrast, while a preference for quantitative information was found at the individual decision level, at a group decision level there were no significant differences in the discussion or use of quantitative and qualitative information, with only one exception: significantly more statements were made about quantitative information.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quantification</field><field name="subject">Group decision making</field><field name="subject">Accounting</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuous-time Model Predictive   Control</field><field name="creator">Truong, Quan</field><field name="description">Model Predictive Control (MPC) refers to a class of algorithms that optimize   the future behavior of the plant subject to operational constraints [46].

Shelterbelts surrounding orchard blocks can significantly reduce spray drift by intercepting droplets from the airflow. At present, there is little information available with which to predict drift deposits downwind, particularly in the case of a fully-sheltered orchard block. In this thesis, we develop a simple mathematical model for the transport of airborne drifting spray droplets, including the effects of droplet evaporation and interception by a shelterbelt. The object is for the model to capture the major features of the droplet transport, yet be simple enough to determine an analytic solution, so that the deposit on the ground may be easily calculated and the effect of parameter variations observed. We model the droplet transport using an advection-dispersion equation, with a trapping term added to represent the shelterbelt. In order to proceed analytically, we discretise the shelterbelt by dividing it into a three-dimensional array of blocks, with the trapping in each block concentrated to the point at its centre. First, we consider the more straightforward case where the droplets do not evaporate; solutions are presented in one, two and three dimensions, along with explicit expressions for the total amount trapped and the deposit on the ground. With evaporation, the model is more difficult to solve analytically, and the solutions obtained are nestled in integral equations which are evaluated numerically. In both cases, examples are presented to show the deposition profile on the ground downwind of the shelterbelt, and the corresponding reduction in deposit from the same scenario without the shelterbelt.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spray drift</field><field name="subject">orchards</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics::230108 Harmonic and Fourier analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">POLISHING OF POLYCRYSTALLINE DIAMOND COMPOSITES</field><field name="creator">CHEN, Yiqing</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dynamic friction, polishing, polycrystalline diamond, PCD, composites, material removal mechanism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ion Energy Measurements in Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation</field><field name="creator">Allan, Scott Young</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plasma immersion ion implantation</field><field name="subject">ion energy distribution</field><field name="subject">retarding field energy analyser</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing the Social System of a Catholic Secondary School: An examination of salient design features pertinent to the change process from a permacultural perspective</field><field name="creator">Harney, Peter John</field><field name="description">The purpose of the research documented in this thesis is to identify and investigate the organisational design principles that influence change processes in a school context.

There are four design principles that provide a perspective for the study of salient features that impinge on the processes of organisational change. These four perspectives are - site, social, energy and abstract.

Increasingly, population measures that provide accurate estimates of body fatness in children are required. Body mass index (BMI), or weight standardised for height, remains the most cost-effective and practical tool in this regard. However, there is evidence that the association between BMI and body fatness is variable in children from different ethnic backgrounds. The primary aim of this thesis was to investigate the appropriateness of BMI thresholds for defining overweight and obesity in female children and adolescents from five diverse ethnic groups. Secondary objectives were to examine the associations between weight control practices and perceptions, and to compare objectively-measured physical activity levels with participation in active transport (AT). In order to achieve the primary aim stated above, it was necessary to obtain valid and reliable measures of body fat percentage (%BF) in a large sample of children. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is well suited for this purpose, providing a portable and cost-effective means to estimate fat-free mass (and subsequently %BF). While equations exist for European, Maori, and Pacific Island children, findings from the preliminary study described in Chapter 2 demonstrate that there are no BIA equations appropriate for Chinese and Indian children. Given that these two groups are two of the fastest growing ethnicities in New Zealand, a new equation was developed that enables Asian girls to be included in future BIA research. The main study of this thesis involved a large-scale investigation of body composition in New Zealand&#8217;s five major ethnic groups (European, Maori, Pacific Island, East Asian, and South Asian). A total of 1,081 adolescent girls aged 11-16 years participated in the Girls&#8217; Activity and Body Composition (ABC) Study. To extend the age range, data were combined with another study of 5-11-year-old New Zealand children (595 girls), coined the Body-Size and Steps in Children (BASIC) Study. Both studies measured BMI from height and weight, %BF from bio impedance measurements, and physical activity using sealed multiday memory pedometers over five consecutive days. A questionnaire was also administered to the adolescent-aged girls to gather data related to weight perceptions and practices. Initial analyses of the main dataset demonstrated that existing BMI definitions of overweight were relatively insensitive for predicting excess %BF in South and East Asian girls. Conversely, low specificity was observed for Pacific Island and Maori children. These findings provided the rationale for the second set of analyses: the development of BMI cut-off points that correspond to an equivalent level of %BF across all ethnicities. The adjusted BMI curves for overweight and obesity ranged from an average of 3.3 and 3.8 kg.m-2 (respectively) lower than international standards in South Asian girls to 1.5 and 1.9 kg.m-2 higher in Pacific Island girls. Clearly, the proposed changes will have significant effect on our estimates of overweight and obesity in this population group. Subsequent investigation revealed that many adolescent girls misclassify their weight status. However, the number of girls trying to lose weight exceeded those who perceived themselves as being overweight, with the magnitude of the difference dependent on ethnicity. It was concluded that interventions and educational campaigns that assist girls in recognising a state of excess body fat are a priority for all ethnic groups to ensure that behavioural changes necessary to combat widespread overweight and obesity are adopted. Finally, it was observed that the physical activity levels of the participants were significantly lower on weekends (9,528 &#61617; 4,407) than on weekdays (12,597 &#61617; 3,630). Furthermore, a consistent decline in daily step counts was observed with age: after adjustment for ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES), girls in school years 9-10 achieved 2,469 (weekday) and 4,011 (weekend) fewer steps than girls in years 1-2. Daily step counts also varied by ethnicity, with Maori girls the most active and South Asian girls the least active. Overall, girls who used AT to and from school averaged 1,052 more weekday steps than those who did not use AT. These data suggest that adolescent-aged girls and girls of Asian descent are priority groups for future physical activity interventions, and that the promotion of AT in girls appears to be worthwhile.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Obesity</field><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">Ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Body mass index</field><field name="subject">Body fat</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/463</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand's destination image and the Chinese outbound market : a comparative study between the Beijing (north) and Guangdong (south) markets</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Chengcheng</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the similarities and differences between northern and southern Chinese markets (in this case, the Beijing and Guangdong markets) in relation to New Zealand's destination image, from both visitors' and tour guides' perspectives. Destination image issues focused on information source and cultural factors, as well as their interrelationships. The purpose of this research is to achieve a better understanding of the Chinese outbound market as well as the heterogeneous market characteristics in order to provide insight for the New Zealand tourism industry. This research involves both interviews with visitors and tour guides based on a grounded theory methodology. Analysis of the interviews was based on two research themes: factors influence New Zealand's destination image at different stages, as well as the Chinese regional market difference in relation to destination image. Interviews were also focused on two stages of destination image formation: pre-visit images and in-destination images. Difference between Beijing and Guangdong markets on the research themes during the different stages were explored and analyzed. Research findings showed that destination image is influenced by both the information source and the cultural factors for Chinese tourists. Moreover, regional difference existed in China in particular their perceptions about New Zealand, preferences and personal values. Most tourists consider pre-visit image is essential; however, New Zealand's image in China was not very impressive and effective. Before visitation, New Zealand's destination image is influenced heavily by information available in China. The way tourists search for information and the image they were attracted for coming to New Zealand between Beijing and Guangdong were different. During-visit impressions of New Zealand were considered by majority of the tourists to be better than their expectations. However, due to their different cultural backgrounds, Beijing and Guangdong tourists have different reactions to New Zealand's products, which can be reflected through different shopping behaviours, and different demands and satisfaction levels. Overall, segmenting the Chinese outbound market into regions is recommended for future marketing, in order to attract more visitors by providing more suitable products.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism - New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Tourism - China.</field><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nurturing servant leaders in religious education</field><field name="creator">Cyril, Lesley Anne</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to explore conditions under which the human spirit flowers in modern organisations. The topic of the thesis was sparked by prolonged study at the Master&#8217;s level of the writings of Robert K. Greenleaf, modern servant leadership theorist. Greenleaf was concerned with the ways and the conditions in which the human spirit flowers. He wrote a number of essays on the topic (Greenleaf, 1996b). He often questioned what organisations as they currently stood were doing to help people grow as whole people. As workers spend increasing amounts of time in the workplace, organisations continue to seek ways in which to increase employee satisfaction and decrease the compartmentalising of human experience. The geographical context of study is that of Aotearoa/New Zealand with participants selected from the Church Educational System of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the T&#257;maki-makau-rau/Auckland region. The Church Educational System, or CES, is a worldwide religious education provider headquartered in the Western United States. The context for study was chosen based on my perceived personal growth as a student for nine years in the CES programmes and my desire to understand how the programme was administered in Aotearoa/New Zealand. The project employs a qualitative methodology using as primary data gathering methods in-depth interviews with three CES directors, three focus groups made up of sixteen volunteer teachers, classroom observations, and document analysis. Using Greenleaf&#8217;s descriptions of the servant leader as a central focus, I attempt through this qualitative study to address the central research question: How does the Church Educational System (CES) nurture servant leaders? The central metaphor of the garden was used in processing and analysing data. The garden metaphor was intended to assist in the conceptualisation of relationships of service as they are at work in the lives of participants. Identified relationships of service from the findings were between participants co-workers (plants), love (life-force), Jesus Christ (sun), The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (plot), purpose (strength), Aotearoa/New Zealand (soil), exemplars (canopy), experience (seasons), Church Educational System (gardener), positions, training, programmes (gardener tools), growth (colour/aroma/fruit), knowledge (water), and organisational care (pruning/transplanting). Findings indicated that nurturing in the Church Educational System is influenced by the ability of the organisation to bring people together in meaningful ways. Findings also show that understanding relationships of service that make up whole people may be an important step for organisations in the nurturing of servant leaders. Nurturing in the CES appears to be taking place in three primary areas: balancing, renewal, and regeneration. The findings of this study have significance for those inside and outside of the CES. A chapter is dedicated to exploring possible application of findings in variant organisational contexts. Providing consistent formal and informal opportunities for sharing in spirit and intellect at the organisational level appears to be a key in the nurturing of servant leaders in organisations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Servant leadership</field><field name="subject">Religious education</field><field name="subject">Nurturing</field><field name="subject">Latter-Day Saints</field><field name="subject">Church Educational System</field><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Observing mothers lifting their children in their own home to identify factors which might give rise to musculoskeletal disorders</field><field name="creator">McKay, Renee</field><field name="description">The lifting associated with childcare has been linked to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in mothers (Griffin &amp; Price, 2000; Sanders &amp; Morse, 2005). The purpose of the current study was to investigate, for the first time through observation, the lifting of young children by mothers in the home environment to identify risk factors which might give rise to MSDs. Twenty five mothers with one or two children weighing between 9 and 15kg (n = 30) completed a self-report survey modified for the New Zealand context (The Ergonomics of Caring for Children (Sanders &amp; Morse, 2005)). They also took part in a structured observation of lifting in the home using a checklist based on the New Zealand Manual Handling Hazard Control Record NZMHHCR (OSH &amp; ACC, 2001). Modifications were derived from careful consultation of current literature to enable contributory factors related to the load, the mother, the environment and the task to be assessed and a rating of low, medium, or high risk to be assigned to each factor. A protocol to guide risk assessment was developed to accompany the tool. The modified observational checklist was named the OMLITH (Observing Mothers Lifting In The Home). Survey data identified the mothers as aged between 28 and 40 years, predominantly NZ European, and of average height (&#967; = 1.69cm) and weight (Body Mass Index = 24). The children in the sample weighed between 9 and 14.5kg and had an average age of 17months. All the mothers were either married (n=20) or living with a significant other (n=5) and their partners frequently (n=13) or always (n=12) helped with childcare. The mean time mothers spent per week on the following activities were: sleep, 6.8hrs (n=25), housework, 14.9hrs (n=25), exercise, 2.9hrs (n=22), watching television or using the home computer, 4.3hrs (n=22), hobbies, 2.2hrs (n=19), gardening or home maintenance, 2.9hrs (n=18). Thirteen of the mothers worked (3 full-time, 10 part-time) and 20 mothers used childcare services. Ratings of the physical stress associated with 50 childcare tasks showed that mothers differentiated between tasks in terms of physical stress to a significant degree (p.000), typically rating &#8216;Bending while carrying a child&#8217; as almost twice as stressful as the average rating. Other categories rated significantly above the average stress rating were:  &#8216;Use of a backpack to carry infant/child&#8217;, &#8216;Use of baby jogger&#8217;, &#8216;Carrying child on your shoulders&#8217;, &#8216;Standing bent over to wash child in bath or sink&#8217;, &#8216;Lifting child into or out of cot&#8217;, &#8216;Prolonged squatting or stooping while playing with child&#8217;, and &#8216;Placing child in car seat or removing child from car seat&#8217;. Mothers reported experiencing MSDs most commonly in the low back (n=16), and the neck, shoulder and upper back (n=8 each).  Data from the 87 observations using the OMLITH showed that children were a challenging load due to their moving centre of gravity, and were often unpredictable or awkward to handle. The grip required to lift a child more often than not fell outside the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommendation. In 72.9% of tasks the child&#8217;s weight created a high risk level. The lifting tasks involved horizontal and vertical lift distances that presented a moderate to high risk level in 82.8% of situations. Lifting while twisting and side-bending was assigned a moderate to high risk level in 72.4% of tasks. Risk associated with working at an externally controlled pace; and handling children while seated or kneeling/crouching was also observed. The home environment presented risk associated with obstacles, a variety of floor surfaces and stairs or slopes. Mothers were also observed lifting in confined spaces. Individual factors identified as important considerations were: a mismatch between mothers&#8217; strength and fitness and the lifting requirements, pain or injury, pregnancy, and fatigue. The structured checklist proved to be an appropriate tool to identify the contributory risk factors present when mothers lift in the home and to make an assessment of the level of risk. Results suggest a notable number of risk factors which might give rise to MSDs are present when mothers lift their children at home. The author concludes that further research is warranted to quantify risks, to identify prevention strategies for MSDs in this population, and to guide health providers with regard to treatment and rehabilitation of mothers with MSDs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lifting</field><field name="subject">Mothers</field><field name="subject">Ergonomics</field><field name="subject">Quantitative descriptive design</field><field name="subject">Risk factors</field><field name="subject">Observation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"In our house we're not terribly sexual" : exploring the barriers to supporting intellectually disabled people in the area of sexuality and intimacy : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Sociology, Social Policy and Social Work, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hamilton, Carol Anne</field><field name="description">How support workers enable, regulate or constrain the sexual expression of intellectually disabled people who live in service agency group homes is the subject of this thesis. A general literature search of what intellectually disabled people currently experience in their lives, including their experiences in the area of sexuality and intimacy, begins this investigation. Secondly, an extensive literature review of the support role, incorporating an appraisal of past and current issues related to the support position in general and to the area of sexuality support in particular, was completed. What intellectually disabled people themselves would like in relation to sexuality and intimacy support was included in this section. Thirdly, a review of research studies focussing on the operation of the support position within service agency systems was undertaken. These explorations revealed a high degree of reluctance on the part of workers to provide assistance in the sexuality area, despite a proven necessity for support to be made available to the intellectually disabled people they worked with. Review research studies suggested a variety of causal factors in explanation of this reluctance. These suggestions link to two meta-reason positions. Failure to prove support either stemmed from individual worker&#8217;s inactions due to ignorance and/or incompetence, or from wider systemic failures on the part of agency services to positively value and support this key service role in this area. However, little if any analysis of the possible influence of the broader social, emotional and cultural contexts, in which the concepts &#8216;sexuality&#8217; and &#8216;(intellectual) disability&#8217; are located, could be found in the studies reviewed. Eleven in-depth interviews were conducted with front-line support workers about their sexuality support practice. Preliminary readings of the interview texts revealed a similar reluctance on the part of the workers concerned to assist those they worked with in this area. Interview texts were then subjected to a post-modernist inspired, interpretive discursive analysis. This analysis uncovered and tracked how key power/knowledge effects inherent in the terms &#8216;(intellectual) disability&#8217;, &#8216;sexuality&#8217;, &#8216;gender&#8217; and &#8216;desire&#8217; inhering in the concept of an &#8216;ideal (sexual) couple&#8217; interweave to shape the &#8216;no support necessary&#8217; practice responses held in worker&#8217;s interview talk. From this exploration it is suggested that research studies of workers&#8217; practices as an aspect of the promotion of change in support outcomes in the sexuality support area need to go beyond the parameters of recommendations that stem from considerations of either individual or systemic limitation alone. It remains a convincing point to suggest that poorly performing workers need retraining in this area and the overall value of the support role within service organizations needs reshaping. However, future research recommendations also need to engage more directly and effectively with the effects of the wider social and emotional &#8220;ideal (sexual) couple&#8221; ambiguities that also influence worker&#8217;s lack of assistance in this complex and sensitive support area. The use of a post-modern perspective as a helpful conceptual tool in unpacking the power these ambiguities hold within the support position is offered as a productive way forward for future research and practice development.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intellectually disabled people</field><field name="subject">sexuality</field><field name="subject">social work</field><field name="subject">intimacy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370200 Social Work::370204 Counselling , welfare and community services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/843</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher change: Individual and cultural risk perceptions in the context of ICT integration</field><field name="creator">Howard, Sarah Katherine</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teacher change</field><field name="subject">risk perceptions</field><field name="subject">school culture</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indigenous language usage in a digital library: He hautoa kia ora tonu ai.</field><field name="creator">Keegan, Te Taka Adrian Gregory</field><field name="description">The research described in this thesis examines indigenous language usage in a digital library environment that has been accessed via the Internet. By examining discretionary use of the M&#257;ori Niupepa and Hawaiian N&#363;pepa digital libraries this research investigates how indigenous languages were used in these electronic environments in 2005. The results provide encouragement and optimism to people who are striving to retain, revitalise and develop the use of indigenous languages in information technologies. The Transaction Log Analysis (TLA) methods used in this research serve as an example of how web logs can be used to provide significant information about language usage in a bilingual online information system. Combining the TLA with user feedback has provided insights into how and why clients use indigenous languages in their information retrieval activities. These insights in turn, show good practice that is relevant not only to those working with indigenous languages, indigenous peoples or multilingual environments, but to all information technology designers who strive for universal usability. This thesis begins by describing the importance of using indigenous languages in electronic environments and suggests that digital libraries can provide an environment to support and encourage the use of such languages. TLA is explained in the context of this study and is then used to analyse aspects of te reo M&#257;ori usage in the Niupepa digital library environment in 2005. TLA also indicates that te reo M&#257;ori was used by international clients and this usage differed to te reo M&#257;ori usage by national (Aotearoa) clients. Findings further reveal that the default language setting of the Niupepa digital library had a considerable impact on te reo M&#257;ori usage. When the default language was set to te reo M&#257;ori not only were there more requests in te reo M&#257;ori but there was also a higher usage of te reo M&#257;ori in the information retrieval activities. TLA of the Hawaiian N&#363;pepa digital library indicated that the Hawaiian language was also used in a digital library. These results confirm that indigenous languages were used in digital library environments. Feedback from clients suggests reasons why indigenous languages were used in this environment. These reasons include the indigenous language content of the digital library, the indigenous language default language setting of the digital library and a stated desire by the clients to use the indigenous language. The key findings raise some interface design issues and support the claim that digital libraries can provide an environment to support the use of indigenous languages.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">indigenous language</field><field name="subject">digital library</field><field name="subject">reo Maori</field><field name="subject">universal usability</field><field name="subject">human computer interfaces</field><field name="subject">multilingual interfaces</field><field name="subject">indigenous use of the web</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new paradigm in music education : the Music Education Program at The Australian National University</field><field name="creator">West, Susan</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a qualitative action research process undertaken &#145;in the field&#146; over
approximately eight years of the development of an alternative paradigm for music education. This
new paradigm evolved from a simple, practical approach that was not, in the first instance,
designed to be transformational, but which quickly showed itself to have potential for providing a
different model for conceptualising musical engagement.
&#182;
It is argued that the standard and widely accepted approach to music education has aspects that
does not encourage on-going music making. This study conceptualises that &#145;traditional&#146; Western
approach in terms of a &#145;virtuosic mountain&#146; that prioritises and rewards technical achievement. The
concept of the virtuosic mountain is developed in terms of three &#145;P&#146;s&#146;: Perfection, Practice and
Performance. The concept was developed by not just reviewing current literature but also by
analysing that literature in light of the developing new paradigm as a means of comparing and
contrasting the approaches.
&#182;
Called &#145;The Music Education Program&#146;, this new paradigm is based on a practical approach to
the sharing of music making beyond institutional boundaries like the school gate. Children do not
&#145;perform&#146; in the community but seek to engage others in making music with them without
reference to age, disability or skill level. The focus is on the social outcomes that derive from
music making rather than the improvement of skills, which develop as a natural part of community
engagement. In this respect, the approach has roots in community enculturation processes that are
no longer prominent in Western society.
&#182;
The new paradigm is presented with a contrasting set of &#145;three I&#146;s&#146;: Intent, Identity and
Involvement, which are designed to illustrate how the community &#145;outreach&#146; of the Music
Education Program provides a model for consciously reconceptualising our approach to music
education through re-visiting what might be regarded as &#145;old&#146; practices in a &#145;new&#146; guise. The three
&#145;I&#146;s&#146; are illustrated through a series of critical incidents that highlight the necessary change in
theoretical underpinnings that the practical application of the Program demands. This includes a
particular focus on the Intent behind our music making, rather than the &#145;quality&#146; in terms of technomusical
outcomes; stress on the individual and group choices that develop musical Identity; and
demonstration of the ways in which this paradigm may contribute to voluntary, rather than
enforced, Involvement.
&#182;
The critical incident data is supplemented by some survey and evaluation data which supports
the view that the social component of musical engagement provides an alternate focus to musical
development than does an achievement paradigm. The range of data collected shows that
classroom teachers can take a significant role in the encouragement of music making in the primary
school without relying solely on the expertise of those with specific musical training; and that
overcoming negative attitudes and experiences can transform not only the teacher&#146;s relationship
with music but produce a positive effect on her students.
&#182;
The model described here has evolved through a longitudinal process that constantly maintains
the centrality of the practical operation of the program. In so doing, it moves away from theoretical
constructs that often do not seem to relate directly to practitioners but, at the same time, it avoids
prescriptive methodology. Theory is elucidated through practice in a way that encourages teachers
to develop their own practices that are consistent with underlying principles. This model is
transformative in nature, having first a transformative effect on the principal researcher and thence
on those teachers engaging in professional development with the Program.
&#182;
Since the Music Education Program does not yet have students who have exited the school
system, this study does not attempt to claim success in the long-term in terms of promoting ongoing
engagement through life. Data suggest, however, that it has had an impact in encouraging
teachers to reconnect with music making and enables them to share that music making with their
students, thereby helping to develop more school-based musical engagement that is also affecting
the broader community in the Australian Capital Territory.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music education</field><field name="subject">social music making</field><field name="subject">Music Education Program</field><field name="subject">Canberra School of Music</field><field name="subject">Australian National University</field><field name="subject">ANU</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090816.132910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Generic Middleware Broker for Distributed Systems Integration</field><field name="creator">Slamkovic, Richard Donald</field><field name="description">Seamless middleware integration requires conversion of the message format from the source of the request to that of its target. A number of solutions have been proposed and implemented, but they lack wide applicability and ease of use. This thesis proposes an improved solution based-on dynamic protocol-level systems integration using configuration, rather than programming. This allows large complex enterprises to extend and enhance their existing systems more easily. The major components of this solution are a Middleware Protocol Definition Language (MPDL) based on the Object Management Group (OMG) Interface Definition Language (IDL) that can describe a wide range of protocols declaratively, and a run-time environment, The Ubiquitous Broker Environment (TUBE), that takes these protocol descriptions and performs the necessary mediation and translation. The MPDL can describe a range of synchronous, asynchronous, object-based, and binary and text-based protocols. Ea ch protocol need only be described once, and the framework provides a means to easily implement special extensions to the protocol. Further, this approach can be used as the basis for developing new middleware protocols; the protocol used internally by TUBE is itself defined and executed using this approach.      TUBE has been implemented and successfully tested across a range of commonly used middleware, including synchronous, asynchronous, object-based, binary and text-based protocols.

New Zealand is no exception; according to the most recent national estimates, approximately one in three children is overweight or obese. As a consequence, an understanding of the specific risk factors that predict this condition in children is becoming increasingly important. It is generally accepted that the promotion of physical activity is a key strategy for reducing the risk of childhood obesity. However, there is limited information describing physical activity and its relationship with body fatness in young New Zealanders. The overall aim of this thesis was to gain insight into the associations between excess fatness and physical activity in New Zealand children from a diverse range of socio-demographic groups. Three related studies were conducted to achieve this aim: a large descriptive survey of obesity and physical activity patterns in primary-aged children, and two preceding studies which develop the methodology for objective assessment of physical activity in this population. The first study provided the only validation data for the NL-2000 multiday memory (MDM) pedometer in children. In a sample of 85 participants aged 5-7 and 9-11 years, the NL-2000 offered similar accuracy and better precision than the widely used SW-200 pedometer (NL-2000: mean bias = -8.5 &#177; 13.3%; SW-200: mean bias = -8.6 &#177; 14.7%). The second study investigated reactivity to wearing pedometers over four 24-hour testing periods in 62 children aged 5-11 years. The sample was divided into two groups: one was given a full explanation of the function of the pedometer, while the other received no information prior to testing. The absence of significant differences in step counts between the first and last test periods indicated that there was no evidence of reactivity to this device for either preparation procedure. The central study presented in this thesis was the measurement of physical activity, body composition, and dietary patterns in 1,226 children aged 5-12 years, from which four chapters (4-7) were derived. The sample was ethnically diverse, with 46.8% European, 33.1% Polynesian, 15.9% Asian, and 4.1% from other ethnicities. Physical activity levels over three weekdays and two weekend days were assessed using NL 2000 pedometers. Percentage body fat (%BF) was determined using hand-to-foot bioelectrical impedance analysis with a prediction equation previously developed for New Zealand children. Waist and hip girths, height, and weight were measured using standard anthropometric techniques. Parent proxy questionnaires were used to assess demographic and lifestyle factors and pedometer compliance. The first reported analyses of this dataset (Chapter 4) examined the effect of weather conditions on children&#8217;s activity levels. In boys, a 10&#186;C rise in ambient temperature was associated with a 10.5% increase in weekday steps and a 26.4% increase in weekend steps. Equivalent temperature changes affected girls&#8217; step counts on weekdays only (16.2% increase). Precipitation also had a substantial impact, with decreases in weekday and weekend step counts during moderate rainfall ranging from 8.3% to 16.3% across all sex, age, and socioeconomic (SES) groups. The aim of Chapter 5 was to understand the relationship between children&#8217;s step counts and their body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and %BF. Mean step counts for this sample were 16,133 &#177; 3,864 (boys) and 14,124 &#177; 3,286 (girls) on weekdays, and 12,702 &#177; 5,048 (boys) and 11,158 &#177; 4,309 (girls) on weekends. Significant associations were detected between steps.day-1 and both WC and %BF, but not between steps.day-1 and BMI. The findings in Chapter 6 extended these results by estimating the number of steps required to reduce the risk of excess adiposity in children (16,000 and 13,000 steps.day-1 for boys and girls, respectively). Finally, the study described in Chapter 7 examined the associations between excess adiposity and a series of demographic and lifestyle variables, providing the first assessment of body fat correlates in young New Zealanders. Our results indicated that children aged 11-12 years were 15.4 times more likely to be overfat (boys, %BF &#8805; 25%; girls, %BF &#8805; 30%) than those aged 5-6 years. In addition, the odds of overfat were 1.8 times greater in Asian children than in European children, and 2.7 times greater in the low SES group when compared with the high SES group. Three modifiable behaviours related to fat status were also identified: low physical activity, skipping breakfast, and insufficient sleep on weekdays. Clustering of these risk factors resulted in a cumulative increase in the prevalence of overfat.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public health</field><field name="subject">Body composition</field><field name="subject">Pedometers</field><field name="subject">Bioelectrical impedance analysis</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Step counts</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity in New Zealand preschoolers: amount, associations, and accounts</field><field name="creator">Oliver, Melody</field><field name="description">Improving physical activity (PA) participation is a public health priority in developed and developing countries to curb the substantial and growing prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases. Early childhood may be an especially important time to encourage PA; however, there is a paucity of research in this area. The aim of this research was to contribute to the limited body of work in PA in early childhood by investigating PA measurement approaches in young children and applying this knowledge to determine socio-environmental associations of preschool PA. An initial literature review provided the background for the thesis and determined the approaches taken in the ensuing chapters. A second literature review provided a detailed critique of research specific to PA measurement in early childhood to further inform the empirical studies. Information for the empirical chapters was drawn from three research projects: two studies were completed that assessed tools for objectively measuring PA in young children (pedometers and accelerometers), and these studies informed a final project to quantify associates of PA in a sample of preschool-aged children. Novel and important findings from the preliminary studies were that pedometer accuracy for measuring free-living PA and walking in children aged 3-5 years was poor, especially for pedometers worn at the back of the child, or during slow walking. Furthermore, when investigating the utility of accelerometers (more complex and frequently adopted tools) to quantify PA intensity in preschoolers, their application and use of commonly employed thresholds resulted in systematic underestimation of PA intensity and poor agreement (&#61547;=0.09) when compared with a direct observation criterion measure. Application of existing accelerometer thresholds to classify PA intensity in preschoolers was therefore likely to yield biased estimates.  Given the dearth of robust alternatives, a novel approach was developed to calculate individual activity rates from the raw accelerometer data. To account for over-dispersion in accelerometer counts, daily average activity rates per second were derived for each participant using negative binomial generalised estimating equation (GEE) models with a first-order autoregressive (AR1) correlation structure. These rates were assumed to be exchangeable between days and normally distributed. Potential socio-environmental associates of children&#8217;s activity rates and body size were thus assessed using normal GEE models with exchangeable correlation structures. Parental PA and child age were independently and significantly associated with child activity rates (P&#8804;0.04). No relationships between child body size and PA or television (TV) exposure were found. Common approaches to PA measurement and data consideration were challenged in this research and novel robust methods devised utilising contemporary statistical methods. Accelerometer data can be successfully reduced to individual activity rates to mitigate current issues related to objective PA quantification with preschoolers. Parental involvement in preschool PA interventions is worthy of further investigation, and younger children may stand to benefit more from increased activity. Further exploration of the complex interactions between PA, exposure to media, and health outcomes in preschool-aged children is warranted.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical Activity</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Accelerometer</field><field name="subject">Pedometer</field><field name="subject">Family</field><field name="subject">Measure</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physical power pre-requisites and acute effects of resisted sled loading on sprint running kinematics of the early acceleration phase from starting blocks</field><field name="creator">Maulder, Peter Scott</field><field name="description">The ability to perform well during the sprint start and early acceleration phases of sprint running is critical. Many forms of training interventions are utilised to give a sprinter a competitive edge over their opponents in these particular phases. Despite this fact, there has been limited research on the technical and power type training strategies appropriate to improve sprint kinematics and the associated sprint performance in the sprint start and early acceleration phases. PURPOSE: To determine the best sprint start and early acceleration phase kinematic determinants, investigate the effect that load has on the kinematics of the sprint start and early acceleration performance and to determine how various physical characteristics may influence both resisted and unresisted sprint running. METHODS: Ten male track sprinters (mean &#177; SD: age 20 &#177; 3 years; height 1.82 &#177; 0.06 m; weight 76.7 &#177; 7.9 kg; 100 m personal best: 10.87 + 0.36 s {10.37 - 11.42 s}) attended two testing sessions. The first session required the athletes to sprint twelve 10 m sprints from a block start under unresisted and resisted (10% &amp; 20% body mass) sled conditions. The second session required each athlete to complete an anthropometric assessment (height, mass, 3 bone lengths, 2 bone widths) and a variety of vertical (squat jump, countermovement jump, continuous straight legged jump) and horizontal (single leg hop for distance, single leg triple hop for distance) jump tests (3 trials each). Centre of gravity, joint and segment kinematics were calculated from 2D analysis utilising a kinematic analysis system (Ariel Performance Analysis System, U.S.A.). Means and standard deviations are presented for kinematic and performance measures. Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficients were employed to establish relationships between sprint start (block) performance variables and 10 m sprint performance. A linear regression analysis was used to quantify the relationships between the dependent variables (start performance and 10 m sprint time) and selected kinematic independent variables. ANOVA's with repeated measures were used to determine if there was a significant interaction between the kinematics under the various loaded conditions. A stepwise multiple regression and linear regression analysis were used for the prediction of unresisted and resisted sprint times from anthropometrical and functional performance measures. RESULTS: Mean horizontal block acceleration was identified as the start performance variable with the strongest relationship to 10 m sprint time. The most significant kinematic predictors of mean horizontal block acceleration were a large horizontal block velocity, short start time, and low thigh angle of the front block leg with respect to the horizontal at block takeoff. Sprint time over 10 m was best predicted by a large mean horizontal block acceleration (sprint start performance), increased angle of the front arm shoulder at step takeoff, and increased angle of front upper arm at step takeoff. Sprint start kinematics significantly altered as a result of resisted sled towing were start time (increase) and push-off angle from the blocks (decrease). Step length, stance time and propulsion time significantly increased, whereas flight time and flight distance significantly decreased under loaded conditions. A load of 20% body mass was revealed to be the better training load to utilise during resisted sled sprinting, especially for athletes who performed faster than 2.10 s for a 10 m sprint from a block start. The countermovement jump exercise was a strong predictor of both 10 m and 100 m sprint time. The continuous straight legged jump test was revealed to be a good predictor of resisted sprints over 10m.CONCLUSION: Consideration should be given to the technical training aspects of sprint start performance and forceful arm movements during step takeoff for improving sprint start and early acceleration sprint performance from starting blocks. These technical training aspects should also be supplemented with resisted sled towing with a load of 20% body mass and countermovement jump training to improve sprint ability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sprinting</field><field name="subject">Kinematics</field><field name="subject">Exercise science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A pilot study to develop and validate a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) questionnaire: a health status instrument for TCM assessment in patients with Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee</field><field name="creator">Wang, Ping</field><field name="description">Research suggests acupuncture is potentially an effective treatment for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee. Essential for the evaluation of Chinese acupuncture treatment is the availability of a reliable and valid measurement. However, currently there is no appropriate measurement instrument validated within traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) concepts and frameworks. Objective is to develop and validate a TCM questionnaire as a health status instrument for TCM assessment in patients with OA of the hip and knee. Methods The TCM questionnaire was developed from TCM theory and clinical experience. The questionnaire was examined by experts, for content and faces validity and pre-tested on a volunteer sample of three subjects. The developed questionnaire was validated on a convenience sample of ten subjects from six different clinical settings in Auckland region. The practitioner or receptionist from the selected clinical sites handed out the questionnaire package to their patients who fulfilled the study criteria. Each patient (subject) completed the questionnaire on their arrival and the re-testing questionnaire at a two-week interval. The reliability of the questionnaire was estimated by examining the internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha statistic) and test-retest reliability (Intra-class correlation coefficients). The content validity of the questionnaire was examined by literature review, interviews with patients, and experts' judgement. The construct validity was estimated by the methods of known groups, correlations between scales, and correlations with the SF-36 health survey. The success of the grouping or scaling of the questionnaire was estimated by examining the item (i.e. question) internal consistency and item (i.e. question) discriminant validity. Results The TCM questionnaire scales corresponded to the "eight principal syndromes", "ten questions", and "eight patterns of OA" within TCM concepts and frameworks. Internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) was above .70 for all scales on both occasions of the first test and the second test. Test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient) for each scale was also above .70 for all scales, except the exterior (EXT) scale, which was .44. Moderate associations were found between the age of subjects and the scores of the interior (INT) scale and summary (SUM) scale. There was a significant difference between the groups of use and non-use of on-going medication in the EXT scale scores on the first test, p = .012. However, this significant difference was not found on the second test. As expected, strong or moderate associations were found between the TCM questionnaire and SF-36 comparable scales. Conclusions The TCM questionnaire was developed within TCM concepts and frameworks. The questionnaire contains 23 items with two main scales (the EXT scale and the INT scale) and one additional scale (the SUM scale). It takes approximately five minutes to complete and is entirely self-administered. Results from this pilot study indicate that this TCM questionnaire might have adequate reliability and validity. Therefore, the questionnaire has potential usage as an outcome measurement instrument for the assessment of TCM in the patients with OA of the hip or knee. For this application to be possible, the questionnaire needs further development and validation with a larger sample of patients who have a variety of OA conditions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medicine, Chinese</field><field name="subject">Osteoarthritis</field><field name="subject">Pelvic bones</field><field name="subject">Knee</field><field name="subject">Medicine, chinese traditional</field><field name="subject">Health studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/174</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance appraisal of administrative staff in a tertiary institution: usage and perception</field><field name="creator">Naming, Aileen</field><field name="description">There is little empirical evidence relating to how university administrative employees view the performance appraisal process (Analoui &amp; Fell, 2002). The aims of this study were: (1) to determine the purpose of the performance appraisal system used at Auckland University of Technology (AUT), and (2) to investigate administrative staff perceptions and understanding of this appraisal system. Areas investigated included (1) how allied staff viewed the process, (2) how prepared they were for the process, (3) did it impact on their motivation, and (4) did it help or hinder career development. From the research findings, the researcher prepared a set of recommendations for AUT Human Resource department. The recommendations were intended to assist in making AUT performance appraisals more meaningful and relevant to administrative staff, and foster a better awareness of the benefits of undertaking the process. This study was a partial replication of the Analoui and Fell study undertaken in the UK. Like the study being replicated, this current study was also exploratory basic research adopting a triangulation method. This consisted of the positivistic methodology adopting the cross-sectional survey - structured closed questions questionnaire; the phenomenological methodology using an explanatory case study whereby audio-taped semi-structured interviews were conducted; and the use of researcher (myself) as research instrument. AUT documents relating to performance appraisal were also reviewed. Ethics approval was sought from AUT Ethics Committee. The Analoui and Fell questionnaire and interview guide were modified to suit the AUT context. The sample consisted of 543 staff members. The return rate of the staff survey was 20 per cent.The study found that there was no evidence that the respondents wanted the process discontinued even though comments from those who had been through a Performance and Development Review (P&amp;DR) and Formative Appraisal (FA) indicated a range of both positive and negative experiences. Respondents felt that they were adequately prepared and that they were involved in the pre-appraisal process. In terms of performance appraisal as a motivational tool, few respondents felt that the process motivated them. There was evidence that FA was beneficial in helping with career development. The stated main purposes of AUT performance appraisal were: to assist in administrative (pay increase and promotion), and developmental (training) decisions, with the latter purpose being secondary. Recommendations resulting from the current research findings include: (1) that the current process should be evaluated, and (2) appraisers and appraisees should undertake training prior to an appraisal. On-going research should be undertaken to find out how administrative staff in the wider NZ university sector view the process. To follow-on from the current research, a longitudinal study should be undertaken of administrative staff reactions immediately after an appraisal. Research should also be undertaken to investigate if administrative staff will associate completion of the performance appraisal process which includes the setting of goals with an increased work overload.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Employees</field><field name="subject">Rating of</field><field name="subject">Universities and colleges</field><field name="subject">Employees</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power output of America's Cup grinders can be improved with a biomechanical technique intervention</field><field name="creator">Pearson, Simon</field><field name="description">Grinding set-up in America's Cup sailing provides the power behind tacking and gybing, where the yacht crosses the wind to change direction. Grinding is also used for trimming the sails, which changes the angle on which the yacht is headed. This study provided a descriptive biomechanical overview of grinding on an America's Cup class yacht, and experimentally evaluated the influence of technique instruction on backward grinding performance. Inter-subject differences in body position (technique) throughout the grinding cycle, the ability to alter grinding technique within an eight-day technique intervention period, and the effect of technique on grinding performance as determined by power output were assessed. The quasi-experimental design, in which each of eleven Team New Zealand America's Cup grinders served as their own control, assessed four trials of backward grinding at baseline and post-biomechanical technique intervention testing sessions. Each trial was a maximal effort performed against a high load (250 W) and sustained over a period of eight seconds. Sagittal plane video was used to analyse joint kinematics (elbow, shoulder, trunk, hip, knee, ankle angles and joint centre positions) and to calculate the centre of body mass relative to the grinder pedestal. Height, weight, and limb lengths were obtained from each grinder using the ISAK protocol. Current backward grinding technique employed by the majority of grinders did not optimally use biomechanical principles. Recommendations for improvement were specific to each individual but focused on lowering trunk position and distancing the trunk from the grinding pedestal. Real-time visual feedback was provided to the grinder operators with the main focus being the position of their hip joint (viewed in the sagittal plane), and lowering the shoulder to be vertically level with the apex of the grinding handle cycle. During the intervention the grinders were given added correctional instruction relating to their body position according to perceived technique requirements. Recommendations were based on biomechanical principles regarding body position, and how body position could be altered to optimise the contribution of body weight and force production by the muscles of the upper limb in order to improve the torque applied to the handles. Altering grinding technique according to biomechanical principles produced 4.7% (p = 0.012) greater power during five seconds of grinding performance. Muscular strength, when measured using a 1RM bench pull (116.4 &#177; 9.8 to 117.3 &#177; 10.3), was unaffected by the intervention program, thus not contributing to the increased power output observed during grinding. Moderate changes to body position were observed after the eight-day intervention. Forward lean of the trunk decreased from 25&#176; to 17&#176; (p = 0.028) due to a lower hipy position (-0.09 m to -0.16 m below hub, p = 0.019). The more vertical trunk alignment resulted in the shoulderx position being further from the hub (0.33 m to 0.41 m, p = 0.013), producing a greater line of pull due to a more efficient shoulder vector angle (47&#176; to 36&#176;, p = 0.009). Variability (standard deviation and confidence intervals) decreased in all but four kinematic measures (which exhibited no change) indicating improved consistency in grinding technique. Regression analysis indicated the best predictors for high-load backward grinding performance were COMx position relative to the grinding pedestal and maximal strength. Changes in COMx position explained 40% (p = 0.166) of the variation in grinding performance, while maximal strength showed a relationship of 0.23% (p = 0.144) increase in performance per kilogram of bench pull 1RM. A one standard deviation difference in maximal strength altered the effect of COMx position by 0.26% per centimetre (p = 0.008). Weaker predictive factors were body weight, standing height, and pull angle, while brachial index did not appear to have any substantial influence on backward grinding performance. For future research greater subject numbers should enable more conclusive findings, especially in terms of the technique mechanisms and their relative levels of influence on performance.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">America's Cup</field><field name="subject">Sailing</field><field name="subject">Yacht racing</field><field name="subject">Biomechanics</field><field name="subject">Sport Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preserve, renew, invent [Light Bytes]: an art exploration into disseminating aphorisms</field><field name="creator">Kaiser, Lesley</field><field name="description">The expanding potential for the dissemination and archiving of aphorisms is explored in this practice-based research thesis.

As only 7% were new to teaching, it is likely that they bring a wealth of teaching experience to New Zealand classrooms. In 2002 New Zealand introduced a new school-leaving qualification, the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA), which includes a literacy strand in all subjects (Taylor, 2001). This thesis aims to investigate the needs, perceptions and insights of overseas teachers in Auckland regarding the literacy requirements of the New Zealand secondary curriculum. In this qualitative study, interviews were carried out with ten teachers who had been teaching in Auckland between one and six years and who had all previously taught overseas.  Interviews were also carried out with two literacy leaders as part of the research. Key challenges that emerged were the incorporation of the NCEA literacy requirements in discipline areas; catering for the needs of students who speak English as a second language; dealing with the challenges of teaching literacy across the curriculum and subject specific language; finding and developing relevant resources and sourcing professional development relating to literacy teaching. Findings revealed there were two categories of teachers &#8211; teachers who were very aware of the literacy needs of their students and those who were less aware. Teachers from England and South Africa were very aware of the varied literacy needs of New Zealand students and had received professional development in this area.  Other teachers seemed less aware of the literacy demands of their students, the curriculum or their own professional development needs. This study also reveals that recognition and provision for the professional needs of newly arrived teachers from overseas seems to vary. There is very little research on the experiences of immigrant teachers in New Zealand; this study helps to clarify the issues which these teachers face, particularly with regard to the dual challenges of teaching students with ESL and the expectations that all teachers will include literacy in their approach to teaching, which is part of the NCEA curriculum.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immigrant teachers</field><field name="subject">Overseas teachers</field><field name="subject">Secondary teachers</field><field name="subject">High schools</field><field name="subject">Literacy</field><field name="subject">Qualitative interviews</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/661</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Data analysis and preliminary model development for an odour detection system based on the behaviour of trained wasps</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Zhongkun</field><field name="description">Microplitis croceipes, one of the nectar feeding parasitoid wasps, has been found to associatively learn chemical cues through feeding.

Their detection capabilities and the behaviour of M. croceipes with different levels of coffee odours were studied. First, the data that are related to trained M. croceipes behaviour was extracted from the experimental videos and stored in a Microsoft Excel database.

Secondly, indices were developed to uniquely characterise the behaviour of trained M. croceipes under different coffee concentrations. Thirdly, a preliminary model and its parameters were developed to classify the response of trained wasps when exposed to these five different coffee odours.

L.</field><field name="description">The contamination of process pea (Pisum sativum L.) crops by the immature fruit of black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.) and hairy nightshade (S. physalifolium Rusby var. nitidibaccatum (Bitter.) Edmonds) causes income losses to pea farmers in Canterbury, New Zealand. This thesis investigates the questions of whether seed dormancy, germination requirements, plant growth, reproductive phenology, or fruit growth of either nightshade species reveal specific management practices that could reduce the contamination of process peas by the fruit of these two weeds. The seed dormancy status of these weeds indicated that both species are capable of germinating to high levels (&gt; 90%) throughout the pea sowing season when tested at an optimum germination temperature of 20/30 &#176;C (16/8 h). However, light was required at this temperature regime to obtain maximum germination of S. nigrum. The levels of germination in the dark at 20/30 &#176;C and at 5/20 &#176;C, and in light at 5/20 &#176;C, and day to 50 % germination analyses indicated that this species cycled from nondormancy to conditional dormancy throughout the period of investigation (July to December 2002). For S. physalifolium, light was not a germination requirement, and dormancy inhibited germination at 5/20 &#176;C early in the pea sowing season (July and August). However, by October, 100% of the population was non-dormant at this test temperature. Two field trials showed that dark cultivation did not reduce the germination of either species. Growth trials with S. nigrum and S. physalifolium indicated that S. physalifolium, in a non-competitive environment, accumulated dry matter at a faster rate than S. nigrum. However, when the two species were grown with peas there was no difference in dry matter accumulation. Investigation of the flowering phenology and fruit growth of both species showed that S. physalifolium flowered (509 &#176;Cd, base temperature (Tb) 6 &#176;C) approximately 120 &#176;Cd prior to S. nigrum (633 &#176;Cd). The fruit growth rate of S. nigrum (0.62 mm/d) was significantly faster than the growth rate of S. physalifolium (0.36 mm/d). Because of the earlier flowering of S. physalifolium it was estimated that for seedlings of both species emerging on the same date that S. physalifolium could produce a fruit with a maximum diameter of 3 mm ~ 60 &#176;Cd before S. nigrum. Overlaps in flowering between peas and nightshade were examined in four pea cultivars, of varying time to maturity, sown on six dates. Solanum physalifolium had the potential to contaminate more pea crops than S. nigrum. In particular, late sown peas were more prone to nightshade contamination, especially late sowings using mid to long duration pea cultivars (777-839 &#176;Cd, Tb 4.5 &#176;C). This comparison was supported by factory data, which indicated that contamination of crops sown in October and November was more common than in crops sown in August and September. Also, cultivars sown in the later two months had an ~ 100 &#176;Cd greater maturity value than cultivars sown in August and September. Nightshade flowering and pea maturity comparisons indicated that the use of the thermal time values for the flowering of S. nigrum and S. physalifolium can be used to calculate the necessary weed free period required from pea sowing in order to prevent the flowering of these species. The earlier flowering of S. physalifolium indicates that this species is more likely to contaminate pea crops than is S. nigrum. Therefore, extra attention may be required where this species is present in process pea crops. The prevention of the flowering of both species, by the maintenance of the appropriate weed free period following pea sowing or crop emergence, was identified as potentially, the most useful means of reducing nightshade contamination in peas.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pisum sativum L.</field><field name="subject">Solanum nigrum</field><field name="subject">Solanum physalifolium var. nitidibaccatum</field><field name="subject">weed</field><field name="subject">dormancy</field><field name="subject">germination</field><field name="subject">thernal time</field><field name="subject">flowering</field><field name="subject">fruit growth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300204 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1160</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Was the Tooth Fairy breast fed? The politics of infant tooth decay</field><field name="creator">Luxford, Yvonne, School of History &amp; Philosophy of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the mid 1970s American paediatric dentists started publishing claims that breast feeding an infant on demand and/or during the night was as dangerous to the infant's dental health, in terms of the production of caries, as the previously established dangers of Baby Bottle Tooth Decay. It was argued by some dentists that this danger increased if the infant was breast fed for an extended period of time. Such claims have gained support from many dentists, and their professional bodies, into the twenty-first century. This thesis examines the historical, social, commercial and cultural influences that supported the development of such assertions. It analyses the ways in which expert reinforcement was gained, and scrutinises the scientific controversy as publicly fought in professional journals and other outlets. The thesis also examines the growing status of the dental profession, especially in connection with its claim to specialised scientific and medical knowledge in the production of dental caries. Further, consideration is given to the medicalisation of breast feeding and the associated commercial infant feeding dispute. The thesis attempts to redress the current lack of theoretical analysis of the construction of dental knowledge. To date there has been minimal academic contribution to the history of dentistry; however, the absence of extensive analysis has been advantageous in enabling an original approach to the material.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breastfeeding.</field><field name="subject">Dental caries in children.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25224</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of odour in Australian mammalian predator/prey interactions</field><field name="creator">Russell, Benjamin Gallard, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Odour plays an important role in many predator/prey interactions. In the northern hemisphere, many mammalian prey species have been shown to respond to predator odours. It is also widely assumed that mammalian predators utilise odours to locate their prey. This thesis explores the importance of odour in Australian mammalian predator/prey interactions. Responses of native Australian species to the faecal odour of two predators; the native tiger quoll Dasyurus maculatus and the introduced red fox Vulpes vulpes, were evaluated through live-trapping and focussed behavioural studies of captive animals. Tiger quoll responses to prey olfactory cues were investigated in a captive experiment. Native rodents (bush rats Rattus fuscipes, swamp rats R. lutreolus and eastern chestnut mice Pseudomys gracilicaudatus) equally avoided traps scented with either quoll or fox faeces, and in captive experiments, bush rats and swamp rats reduced their average speed in response to both predator odours. Of the marsupial species, northern brown bandicoots Isoodon macrourus and common brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula were captured more frequently in quoll-scented traps than unscented traps or foxscented traps, while captures of brown antechinus Antechinus stuarttii, long-nosed bandicoots Perameles nasuta and southern brown bandicoot I. obesulus were unaffected by the either predator odour. In captive experiments, brown antechinus, long-nosed and northern brown bandicoots decreased their foraging in response to both predator odours, and spent less time in areas scented with quoll faeces. Tiger quolls didn't appear to detect odour sources from a distance of &gt;65 cm, but they did follow scent trails and spent more time in areas scented with the urine and faeces of potential prey. Chemical analysis revealed no common components in fox and quoll odour which prey species could be responding to. Therefore, these native species have evolved to respond to fox odour since foxes were introduced to Australia 130 years ago. The stronger response of native rodents to fox odour may be a legacy of their co-evolution with canid predators prior to entering Australia. A better understanding of how odour is utilised in Australian predator/prey interactions may lead to a greater ability to protect Australia's unique mammalian fauna from introduced predators.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Predation (Biology)</field><field name="subject">Predatory animals - Australia - Sense organs</field><field name="subject">Spotted-tailed quoll - Ecology - Sense organs</field><field name="subject">Red fox - Ecology - Australia - Sense organs</field><field name="subject">Rodents - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Brown antechinus - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Bandicoots - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Trichosurus vulpecula - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Smell</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consequences of an altered intrauterine environment on the offspring???s renal, cardiovascular and renin angiotensin systems</field><field name="creator">O???Connell, Amanda Elizabeth, School of Medical Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the effects of an altered intrauterine environment on the offspring???s renal, cardiovascular and renin angiotensin systems. After a midgestational asphyxial episode in fetal sheep (30 min total umbilical cord occlusion at 90 days; term 150 days) the hydrops that resulted had not completely resolved by 130 days. While the heart and kidneys were apparently unaffected, the brain and lung weights were 37% and 50% lower than sham values, respectively and there were joint contractures. The effects of maternal renal disease on the offspring were investigated. Although in utero fetuses of subtotally nephrectomised ewes (STNx) had altered urine flow rates, sodium excretion, haematocrits, plasma chloride and plasma renin levels, by 1-2 weeks after birth these values in the lambs (STNxL) were similar to controls (ConL) under baseline conditions. Body weight and the weights of most organs were similar, including the kidney, in which glomerular number was normal. In the neonatal period, the lambs were subjected to four challenges: furosemide (2 mg/kg intravenous bolus), infusion of angiotensin II and phenylephrine, intravenous infusion of 0.15M saline (50 ml/kg over 30 min) and haemorrhage (20% estimated blood volume over 10 min). These challenges revealed evidence of programming of several aspects of the renal, cardiovascular and renin angiotensin systems in the STNx offspring. As young adults at 6 months of age, male and female offspring of STNx ewes were normotensive and had normal renal function. On a high salt diet (HSD, 0.17M NaCl in 8L water for 5-7days), female offspring of both groups did not become hypertensive. However, the STNx offspring must have retained salt and water as plasma sodium was increased and haematocrit was decreased. In the STNx offspring only, there was a relationship between glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and mean arterial pressure, indicating an inability to maintain a constant GFR in response to changes in arterial pressure.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neonatology</field><field name="subject">Fetus - Physiology</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system</field><field name="subject">Renin-angiotensin system</field><field name="subject">Kidneys</field><field name="subject">Sheep- Embryos</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal integrated multi-sensor system for full-scale structural monitoring based on advanced signal processing</field><field name="creator">Li, Xiaojing, School of Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications &amp; School of Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, UNSW</field><field name="description">Modern civil structures as well as loads on them are still too complex to be accurately modeled or simulated. Therefore, structural failures and structural defects are NOT uncommon! More and more full-scale structural monitoring systems have been deployed in order to monitor how structures behave under various loading conditions. This research focuses on how to maximise benefits from such full-scale measurements by employing advanced digital signal processing techniques. This study is based on accelerometer and GPS data collected on three very different structures, namely, the steel tower in Tokyo, the long and slender suspension bridge in Hong Kong, and the tall office tower in Sydney, under a range of loading conditions, i.e., typhoon, earthquake, heavy traffic, and small scale wind. Systematic analysis of accelerometer and GPS data has demonstrated that the two sensors complement each other in monitoring the static, quasi-static and dynamic movements of the structures. It has also been confirmed that the Finite Element Model could under-estimate the natural frequencies of structures by more than 40% in some case. The effectiveness of using wavelet to de-noise GPS measurement has been demonstrated. The weakness and strengths of accelerometer and GPS have been identified and framework has been developed on how to integrate the two as well as how to optimize the integration. The three-dimensional spectral analysis framework has been developed which can track the temporal evolution of all the frequency components and effectively represents the result in the 3D spectrogram of frequency, time and magnitude. The dominant frequency can also be tracked on the 3D mesh to vividly illustrate the damping signature of the structure. The frequency domain coherent analysis based on this 3D analysis framework can further enhance the detection of common signals between sensors. The developed framework can significantly improve the visualized performance of the integrated system without increasing hardware costs.  Indoor experiments have shown the excellent characteristics of the optical fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) for deformation monitoring. Innovative and low-cost approach has been developed to measure the shift of FBG???s central wavelength. Furthermore, a schematic design has been completed to multiplex FBGs in order to enable distributed monitoring. In collaboration with the University of Sydney, the first Australian full-scale structural monitoring system of GPS and accelerometer has been deployed on the Latitude Tower in Sydney to support current and future research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Structural analysis (Engineering)</field><field name="subject">Structural stability.</field><field name="subject">Automatic data collection systems.</field><field name="subject">Detectors.</field><field name="subject">Global Positioning System.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-verbal and verbal behaviour of beginner learners of Japanese: pragmatic failure and native speaker evaluation</field><field name="creator">Fukuda-Oddie, Mayumi, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study, undertaken within the field of interlanguage pragmatics, investigates the kinds of pragmatic failures observed among tertiary level foreign learners of Japanese and also seeks to find reasons to help explain the occurrence of these failures. The focus of the study is on the data generated from a role play where a student has to borrow a book from their Japanese teacher. The primary role play is performed by nine beginner level learners of Japanese studying at an Australian university, but the role play is also performed by ten Japanese native speakers in order to determine what is normative for native speakers in this situation. Unlike previous studies in this area, this research collects kinesic non-verbal data in addition to linguistic data. The data is analysed using Thomas's (1983) concept of pragmatic failure, and Brown and Levinson's (1978, 1987) politeness theory. The study also considers whether Japanese native speakers evenly evaluate the role play performances of the Japanese learners. Despite difficulties in the application of these linguistic theories to beginner level learners, a number of sociopragmatic failures and one pragmalinguistic failure are observed in the role play performances of the Japanese learners. These are partially explained by a lack of instruction, nervousness in performing the role play and the learners' limited proficiency in the Japanese language. Inconsistencies are also observed in the way that JNS participants evaluate the role play performances of the JFL learners.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese language.</field><field name="subject">Interlanguage (Language learning)</field><field name="subject">Pragmatics.</field><field name="subject">Failure (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Students -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">VISUALISATION OF SPATIAL DATA QUALITY FOR DISTRIBUTED GIS</field><field name="creator">Yang, Ting, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Nowadays a substantial trend occurs that vast amounts of geospatial data are supplied, managed, and processed over distributed GIS. It is important to provide users with the capability of visualising spatial data quality information in a meaningful way for distributed GIS, since it will significantly enhance user understanding of data quality and aid them in assessing the data fitness for their application requirements. This thesis investigates the issue of visualisation of spatial data quality for distributed GIS. Based on a review of core concepts associated with spatial data quality, metadata standards, and major research areas related to data quality, the limitations of current data quality presentation are highlighted. To overcome some of these limitations, the research topic of this thesis is proposed, namely, adding visualisation functionality to the presentation of spatial data quality to convey uncertainty information to users in an interactive and graphical manner. Based on a review of the theories on visualisation and the frameworks developed for visualisation of spatial data quality in literature, an extended framework is developed incorporating several aspects of visualisation such as contexts, contents, and techniques, where the hierarchical nature of data quality and error models are two main parts of the visualisation contents. A brief framework of visualisation of spatial data quality for distributed GIS is proposed, where data storage with quality information and web services for visualising data quality are two key components. To satisfy a series of requirements for representing spatial data quality, a new object-oriented data model is proposed based on the review of developments of data models. This data model can specifically deal with the hierarchical nature of data quality and error propagation, recognising data quality as a dynamic process. Further, The implementation of the data model using GML and SVG is discussed. The details of a web service for visualising spatial data quality are addressed. After proposing the requirements on building a system for spatial data quality visualisation for distributed GIS, the design of a prototype visualisation system for distributed GIS is addressed in detail. The prototype visualisation system for spatial data quality is developed and implemented with an example data set, where SVG and JavaScript are used to illustrate how various graphic methods such as animation, data quality filters, and colour gradients can be used for distributed GIS. In addition to the visualisation of positional accuracy at the feature level, in this pilot system, the hierarchical structure of data quality information is also presented. Limitations of the research in this thesis are also addressed. However, in general, this research is of great significance for the contributions made to a relatively new research area in terms of theories, procedures, and software developments.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visualization -- Technique.</field><field name="subject">Geographic information systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A decision support tool for unplanned maintenance at ramp time including aviation regulations and scheduling disruption.</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Jing, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development of a decision support tool for unplanned maintenance of aircraft at ramp time during airport operations. Ramp time is the time between an aircraft arrival and its next departure. Clearance of an aircraft for flight is controlled by aviation regulations. Therefore decisions regarding maintenance are taken by engineers who have to comply with the regulations that are governed outside the organizational structure of the airline. Unplanned maintenance also often disrupts the normal operational scheduling and leads to significant costs. Therefore, the decision support tool must include the relevant aviation regulations, be capable of rescheduling to minimise disruption and be able to optimise solutions based on cost. In this project an aircraft schedule is used to demonstrate the procedures. An assumed fleet of six airplanes fly between three cities. Consultation with aviation experts ensured the size of the fleet and operations are realistic. A regulation database was developed based on the Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) for the aircraft, and a computer programme was developed to provide different options that comply with the regulations and take into account scheduling disruption and costs. In certain cases the regulations allow an aircraft to fly with some components inoperable so long as backup systems can perform the tasks. It is possible then to postpone the maintenance until the aircraft arrives at a properly equipped airport, or until a longer scheduled stopover reduces the disruption to operations. To address the engineering aspects of the project, maintenance of a single component that appears in the MMEL for the chosen aircraft is considered. To plan maintenance following a failure, the cause of the failure needs to be identified. Only then can the resources and time required to repair the defect be defined. The programme validation has confirmed it is able to balance different aspects of decisions related to unplanned aircraft ramp maintenance. Although the programme is based on an assumed fleet operation, the structure of the programme will allow it to be applied to other fleet and route configurations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making -- Computer programs.</field><field name="subject">Airports.</field><field name="subject">Airlines.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Civil society and human security in Meghalaya: identity, power and inequalities</field><field name="creator">McDuie, Duncan, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the role of civil society in addressing human security in the Indian state of Meghalaya. Civil society has been revived over the last two decades and is now one of the key concepts in the study of politics. Yet there are few detailed empirical studies of civil society at a local level examining the constraints on participation and the ways this affects what is contested. Human security has also gained prominence in the past decade as both a challenge to state-centric conceptions of security and as an alternative approach to development by focussing on the security and insecurity of groups and individuals. In order for those experiencing insecurity to identify and contest the causes of insecurity, participation in civil society is necessary. Yet there is very limited analysis on the ability of civil society actors to contest the causes of insecurity in particular local contexts. Meghalaya is part of the region know as Northeast India, one of the least researched regions in South Asia. Identity politics dominate civil society in Meghalaya, empowering particular actors and particular causes of insecurity and marginalising others. Furthermore the construction of Meghalaya in the Indian national context leaves it isolated from civil society actors in other parts of India, intensifying the impact of local circumstances. This thesis examines the responses of civil society actors to environmental insecurity and gender-based insecurity in Meghalaya and finds that participation is constrained by the dominance of identity politics, the power differentials between civil society actors, and existing inequalities within the local context. This thesis reaches three conclusions. First, civil society is constrained by both the state and the power of particular actors and ideas in civil society itself. Secondly, the relationship between civil society and human security is constitutive. Constraints on civil society affect which insecurities can be contested and the prevalence of particular forms of insecurity, especially identity insecurity, empower particular civil society actors and marginalise others. Thirdly, context is vital for understanding the constraints on civil society and the conditions under which these constraints may be transcended. This requires a deeper understanding of Meghalaya that goes beyond the reproduction of homogenous and unchanging ethnic categories.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil society.</field><field name="subject">Identity.</field><field name="subject">Security.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The aortic wrap procedure:a surgical method of treating agerelated aortic dilatation and stiffening.</field><field name="creator">Iliopoulos, Jim, St Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction: There is progressive stiffening and dilatation of the aorta and large elastic arteries with aging as a result of the repetitive cyclic stress they are exposed to throughout life. Aortic stiffening has a number of detrimental effects including an increase in aortic pulse wave velocity and early wave reflection, isolated systolic hypertension, ventricular-vascular mismatch, impaired coronary blood flow reserve, and is the fundamental cause of heart failure in the elderly. The aim of this thesis is to provide proof of concept for the aortic wrap procedure; a surgical treatment of stiffening and dilatation of the ascending aorta with aging. The surgical procedure involves wrapping an elastic material around the ascending aorta of elderly patients, to reduce the stiffness and diameter of the ascending aorta towards that seen in youth. Methods: Proof of concept is investigated in the following studies. 1. The effect of the elastic wrap on the in-vivo stiffness of the normal aorta. 2. The effect of the elastic wrap on the in-vivo stiffness of the dilated and stiffened aorta. 3. The effect of the elastic wrap on the in-vitro stiffness of the aged human ascending aorta and on aortic pressure. 4. The effect of wrapping the aged human ascending aorta on pulse pressure (mathematical model). 5. The effect of chronic implantation on the structure of the normal aorta. 6. The mechanical properties of the ovine thoracic aorta and the elastic wrap material. Results: 1. Elastic wrap application increased the in-vivo stiffness of the normal aorta. 2. Elastic wrap application decreased the stiffness of the stiffened and dilated aorta. 3. Elastic wrap application decreased the in-vitro stiffness of the elderly human ascending aorta and pulse pressure. 4. A reduction in ascending aortic stiffness was sufficient to reduce ascending aortic pulse pressure. Conclusion: Application of the elastic wrap to the aged human ascending aorta is expected to reduce aortic stiffness, as well as systolic and pulse pressure, and to increase diastolic pressure with a reduction in cardiac load. The aortic wrap procedure may be an effective surgical procedure for the treatment of heart failure and isolated systolic hypertension.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aorta -- Diseases.</field><field name="subject">Aorta -- Surgery.</field><field name="subject">Aging.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of cognitive biases on information searching and decision making.</field><field name="creator">Lau, Annie Ying Shan, Centre for Health Informatics, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research is possibly the first study investigating the impact of cognitive biases on information searching and decision making. Set in the context of making health-related decisions, this research tests the hypotheses that (i) people experience cognitive biases during information searching; (ii) cognitive biases can be corrected during information searching; and (iii) correcting for biases during information searching improves decision making. Using a retrospective data analysis, a Bayesian model and a series of prospective empirical experiments, the cognitive biases investigated are anchoring effect, order effects, exposure effect and reinforcement effect.  People may experience anchoring effect, exposure effect and order effects while searching for information. A person???s prior belief (anchoring effect) has a significant impact on decision outcome (P &amp;lt 0.001). Documents accessed at different positions in a search journey (order effects) and documents processed for different lengths of time (exposure effect) have different degrees of influence on decision making (order: P = 0.026; exposure: P = 0.0081).  To remedy the impact of cognitive biases, a series of interventions were designed and trialled to test for their ability to modify the impact of biases during search. A search engine interface was modified to allow for a document-level intervention, which attempts to debias order effects, exposure effect and reinforcement effect; a decision-focussed intervention for debiasing the anchoring effect; and an education-based intervention to inform users about the biases investigated in this research. Evaluation of these alterations to the search interface showed that some of the interventions can reduce or exacerbate cognitive biases during search. Order effects are no longer apparent amongst subjects using a keep document tool (i.e. order debiasing intervention) (P = 0.34); however, it is not associated with any significant improvement in decision accuracy (P = 0.23). Although the anchoring effect remains robust amongst subjects using a for/against document tool (i.e. anchor debiasing intervention) (P &amp;lt 0.001), the intervention is marginally associated with a 10.3% increased proportion of subjects who answered incorrectly pre-search to answer correctly post-search (P = 0.10). Overall, this research concludes with evidence that using a debiasing intervention can alter search behaviour and influence the accuracy and confidence in decision making.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making.</field><field name="subject">Information behavior.</field><field name="subject">Cognition.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol in cellular cholesterol homeostasis.</field><field name="creator">Wong, Jenny, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cellular cholesterol homeostasis ensures that cells are able to acquire enough cholesterol for cellular needs including membrane renewal, but avoid excess accumulation.  Cholesterol homeostasis is maintained by two transcription factors, the Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein-2 (SREBP-2) which regulates the genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake; and the Liver X Receptor (LXR), which regulates the genes involved in maintaining Reverse Cholesterol Transport (RCT).  Both LXR and SREBP-2 are regulated by oxidized cholesterol derivatives, referred to as oxysterols.  24(S),25-epoxycholesterol (24,25EC) is unique amongst the physiologically produced oxysterols as it is synthesized de novo in the mevalonate pathway.  The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate the role of 24,25EC in cellular cholesterol homeostasis.  In Chapter 3, using the statin class of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, we showed that 24,25EC synthesis correlates with the expression of the LXR-target gene, the ATP-binding cassette transporter, A1 (ABCA1) in human macrophages.  In Chapters 4 and 5, we investigated this further showing that the effect of statins on ABCA1 transcription can be modulated by cellular cholesterol status and the extent of macrophage differentiation.  Our results also indicated a critical role of SREBP-2 as a positive regulator of ABCA1 transcription by enabling the generation of 24,25EC.  In Chapter 6, we showed that 24,25EC synthesis paralleled cholesterol synthesis, suggesting that this oxysterol may protect against the accumulation of newly-synthesized cholesterol.  In Chapter 7, we investigated this contention further using a novel strategy of overexpressing the enzyme 2,3-Oxidosqualene Cyclase (OSC) in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells to selectively inhibit 24,25EC synthesis.  In cells lacking 24,25EC, fine-tuning of the acute regulation of cholesterol homeostasis was lost, supporting the hypothesis that 24,25EC functions to protect the cell against the accumulation of newly-synthesized cholesterol.  In Chapter 8, we focused on 24,25EC in a neurological context since cholesterol is an essential component of the central nervous system.  Both astrocytes and neurons had the capacity to synthesize 24,25EC.  Furthermore, both added 24,25EC and stimulated cellular production of 24,25EC modulated expression of LXR and SREBP-2 target genes.  The evidence present in this thesis demonstrates the importance of 24,25EC as an endogenously synthesized regulator of cholesterol homeostasis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cholesterol.</field><field name="subject">Homeostasis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29398</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biophysical studies on FeoB- a transmembrane iron transporter from Escherichia coli</field><field name="creator">Thambiraj, Solomon Rajesh, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Integral membrane proteins perform a wide range of biological processes, including respiration, signal transduction and molecular transport. Structural information is necessary for a full understanding of the mechanisms by which integral membrane proteins work. Ferrous iron transporter protein B (FeoB) is an integral membrane protein of Escherichia coli which is considered to transport ferrous iron in to bacteria. But there are no definite proofs or clear indications of the precise mechanism of ferrous transport. By expressing and crystallizing the G-protein domain (FeoGP) and FeoB, it will be helpful to know about the iron transport system. In order to express FeoB and FeoGP, expression vector pFeoB (FeoB in pGEX-4T-1) and pFeoGP (FeoB in pGEX-4T-1) were made. FeoB and FeoGP proteins were expressed and purified. Using vapour diffusion method crystallization trials of FeoB and FeoGP were done. Crystals of FeoGP are observed and no crystal formation for FeoB.

A major barrier to implementing effective interventions is treatment non-attendance and attrition. The dissertation examines treatment participation among children with conduct problems, and their families, referred to child and youth mental health services. First, a model of treatment engagement was proposed that included Structural strategies (clinic service operations, such as service accessibility) and Therapy Process strategies (aspects of the interaction between the clinician and the family of the referred child).  Consistent with the model of engagement, parent-report and clinician-report measures were developed and evaluated in the local Queensland Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. The next study explored and manipulated Structural aspects in a randomised control trial evaluating the impact of telephone reminder calls. Families of children with conduct problems, in comparison to children without conduct problems, were more likely to miss appointments and to drop out of treatment. The low rate of treatment attendance for conduct problem children was diminished among those assigned to the telephone reminder condition. In the final study, the impact of a clinician training program covering the proposed engagement model was evaluated. Utilising a multiple-staggered baseline design, the training impact on clinician behaviour (n = 30) and client outcomes (n = 221) was evaluated across three mental health services. The training program was associated with a significant increase in clinicians' appraisal and use of the engagement strategies based on clinician report and chart audit measures, but not on the parent report measure. In comparison to clients referred during a baseline period, clients referred after the clinician training program had significantly higher rates of treatment attendance and lower attrition. Greater improvement in mental health functioning was found for clients referred after the training intervention on the clinician rated measure, but not for the parent report of child psychopathology. The study was limited by the use of previously un-validated engagement measures, lack of follow-up for outcome measures, and non-random allocation to conditions. The staggering of interventions across clinics and the comparability of client groups, however, minimised potential confounding explanations. Overall the results show that targeting Structural and Therapy Process aspects can enhance engagement, reduce drop-out, and improve selected outcomes in the treatment of child conduct problems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conduct problems.</field><field name="subject">Mental health services.</field><field name="subject">Engagement.</field><field name="subject">Behavior disorders in children.</field><field name="subject">Behavioral assessment of children.</field><field name="subject">Behavior modification.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29464</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some branching rules for GL(N,C)</field><field name="creator">Hall, Jack Kingsbury, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis considers symmetric functions and algebraic combinatorics via the polynomial representation theory of GL(N,C). In particular, we utilise the theory of Jacobi-Trudi determinants to prove some new results pertaining to the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. Our results imply, under some hypotheses on the strictness of the partition an equality between Littlewood-Richardson coefficients and Kostka numbers. For the case that a suitable partition has two rows, an explicit formula is then obtained for the Littlewood-Richardson coefficient using the Hook  Length formula. All these results are then applied to compute branching laws for GL(m+n,C) restricting to GL(m,C) x GL(n,C).

The objective of this research is to develop an integrated approach to automate, or aid, the design problem solving process. An Integrated Design System (IDS) is proposed focusing on the parametric and detail design. In this system, generation and evaluation of new design problems occur quickly and easily by changing the inputs for the design model. The IDS provides an integrated platform to incorporate available application programs such as CAD and FEM tools into a single system. Four major frameworks, namely information handling, problem decomposition, design space characterization, and problem solving, are proposed and embedded in it to implement the product development process. The information handling includes five aspects. A naming protocol is devised to organize the historical design cases. A search algorithm is proposed to retrieve a design case. A system-generated report is used to distribute the design information. A constraint definition frame is presented to define the relationships between design parameters. Two schemas, information matrix and constraint tree, are developed to represent information in the IDS. A diagonal-centered decomposition scheme is developed utilizing a Genetic Algorithm to decompose a complex design problem. In addition to the conventional genetic operators, two novel genetic operators, unequal position crossover and insertion mutation, are proposed. To characterize the design space, two methods, Incremental Response Method (IRM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), are presented. The IRM is derived from response surface method, while the back-propagated ANN is coded to be self-evaluated. The presented problem solving algorithm constitutes the solving mechanism of the IDS. Based on the assessment of the design objectives, all design parameters are given a priority index to facilitate the parameter selection. An independent recursive method is introduced in this algorithm to handle the design constraints. The case studies are performed on two design problems: a hard disk drive actuator arm and a shaft. The results show that the system can automatically align parameter values towards the objective values in a reasonable manner, and thus verify the feasibility of the embedded frameworks.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Integrated library systems (Computer systems)</field><field name="subject">Problem solving -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Management information systems -- Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using web texts for word sense disambiguation</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yuanyong, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In all natural languages, ambiguity is a universal phenomenon. When a word has multiple meaning depending on its contexts it is called an ambiguous word. The process of determining the correct meaning of a word (formally named word sense) in a given context is word sense disambiguation(WSD). WSD is one of the most fundamental problems in natural language processing. If properly addressed, it could lead to revolutionary advancement in many other technologies such as text search engine technology, automatic text summarization and classification, automatic lexicon construction, machine translation and automatic learning agent technology. One difficulty that has always confronted WSD researchers is the lack of high quality sense specific information. For example, if the word "power" Immediately preceds the word "plant", it would strongly constrain the meaning of "plant" to be "an industrial facility". If "power" is replaced by the phrase "root of a", then the sense of "plant" is dictated to be "an organism" of the kingdom Planate. It is obvious that manually building a comprehensive sense specific information base for each sense of each word is impractical. Researchers also tried to extract such information from large dictionaries as well as manually sense tagged corpora. Most of the dictionaries used for WSD are not built for this purpose and have a lot of inherited peculiarities. While manual tagging is slow and costly, automatic tagging is not successful in providing a reliable performance. Furthermore, it is often the case that for a randomly chosen word (to be disambiguated), the sense specific context corpora that can be collected from dictionaries are not large enough. Therefore, manually building sense specific information bases or extraction of such information from dictionaries are not effective approaches to obtain sense specific information. A web text, due to its vast quantity and wide diversity, becomes an ideal source for extraction of large quantity of sense specific information. In this thesis, the impacts of Web texts on various aspects of WSD has been investigated. New measures and models are proposed to tame enormous amount of Web texts for the purpose of WSD. They are formally evaluated by experimenting their disambiguation performance on about 70 ambiguous nouns. The results are very encouraging and have helped revealing the great potential of using Web texts for WSD. The results are published in three papers at Australia national and international level (Wang&amp;Hoffmann,2004,2005,2006)[42][43][44].</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Search engine.</field><field name="subject">Word sense disambiguation.</field><field name="subject">Ambiguity.</field><field name="subject">Semantics -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Computational linguistics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cell attachment to peplide modified glass surfaces.</field><field name="creator">Sinnappan, Snega Marina, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cell attachment is vital for the integration of biomaterials in the body. Surface modification using cell adhesive peptides, such as Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic (RGD), has showed promise for enhancing cell adhesion. Cell adhesion on glass and polyethylene glycol (PEGylated) surfaces modified with active RGD and Proline- Histidine-Serine-Arginine-Asparagine (PHSRN) peptides as well as inactive RDG and HRPSN control peptides was investigated in serum free conditions using three cell lines; NIH3T3 fibroblasts, MC3T3 pre-osteoblasts and C2C12 pre-myoblasts. Peptide attachment to glass surfaces was confirmed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle measurements. Cell attachment and spreading was equivalent on all peptide and fibronectin coated glass surfaces and was significantly higher than on unmodified glass after 3 hours. Cell attachment to the peptide modified glass was reduced in the presence of soluble RGD and RDG peptides, indicating that cell attachment to these surfaces may be integrin mediated, but not specific for RGD. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide revealed that endogenous protein synthesis did not influence the specificity of cell attachment to the peptide modified glass surfaces in all cell types within a 3 hour period. However, cycloheximide treatment inhibited cell spreading on the peptide modified glass surfaces, suggesting that proteins synthesis was required for spreading. Long term adhesion studies, within a 24 hour period, showed that all cell lines were able to remain attached to the peptide modified glass surfaces, while C2C12 and MC3T3 cells were also able to form focal adhesions during this period. Cell attachment to peptide modified PEGylated surfaces over a 3 hour period showed that NIH3T3 and C2C12 cells experienced significantly higher levels of cell attachment on the RGD modified surface compared to the other peptides. MC3T3 cells attached to all the peptide modified PEGylated surfaces to the same extent, suggesting that cell attachment to peptide modified PEGlyated surfaces, can be cell type dependent. In conclusion all the peptides were able to promote cell adhesion on glass surfaces in the absence of a PEG linker. In the presence of a PEG linker cellular response to the peptide surfaces was both peptide and cell type dependent.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Glass -- Surfaces.</field><field name="subject">Peptides.</field><field name="subject">Cell adhesion.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capacity-development at work: the contribution of workplace-based learning to tax administration</field><field name="creator">McManus, Jacqueline, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with workers, workplace learning and organisations. In the current climate of techno-logisation and globalisation, change is constant. Consequently, development of workers??? capacity to grow and adapt is essential for both the employability of the individual, and the economic survival of organisations. Capacity is considered essential because it encompasses more than current ability, it enables the growth of innovative approaches to work, which are required to adapt to change. Learning is central to capacity-development and so learning skills and related ???general skills??? are vital, but these skills must be developed in a specific context to be useful tools. Learning involves balancing the chaos of uncertainty and the old grooves of experience. Learning also involves personal growth. This study explores ways of helping workers develop capacity and especially learning skills, in a context of complexity, to meet the demands of their changing environment. The methodological approach taken is two fold, including both a conceptual and an empirical component. Firstly, a framework, based on conceptual innovation, is constructed to direct the design of workplace-based programs aimed at developing workers??? capacity. This is done as guidance in tailoring a program that promotes the development of an understanding of the necessary skills and knowledge in the context of the work undertaken, how to use them effectively, and the impact they have on the worker and their environment. It is contended that this framework promotes continued and sustained growth in workers??? skills and adaptability, that is, it develops capacity. Secondly, fieldwork based on a program developed for a group of tax administrators to instantiate this framework is reported. The findings show that this workplace-based program designed for the Australian Taxation Office has precipitated the development of the participant workers??? capacity, and in so doing, has shown the empirical significance of the conceptual innovation. Finally, the broader implications of developing workers??? capacity are explored. These include the need for organisational support for workers??? capacity-development, the possibility of the development of a learning culture in organisations, and the general applicability of the framework to other organisations, professions, and industries.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tax administration and procedure -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Learning.</field><field name="subject">Organization.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29565</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of children???s attitudes towards singing</field><field name="creator">Cobb, Donella, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Children???s attitudes towards school singing have been a growing concern in recent years.  While negative attitudes towards school singing have been acknowledged as one of the factors contributing to the decline of singing in schools, these attitudes conflict directly with the socially acceptable, esteemed and desired status that children place on singing in the world in which they live.  Given the popularity of singing outside of school, negativity towards singing is of particular concern.  Identifying the factors that determine a child???s attitude towards singing in both the school and home context is crucial if positive attitudes towards singing are to be sustained through to adolescence.  The purpose of this research was to explore children???s attitudes towards singing in each stage level between Kindergarten and Year 6 in the home and school context, to identify the factors which determine positive and negative attitudes towards singing and to consider the relationships between attitudes in relation to gender. Interviews were conducted with 147 children between Kindergarten and Year 6 in five New South Wales public schools and attitudes towards singing were tested using a three point attitude measurement scale.  Further data were collected from 118 parents in order to gain an understanding of children???s singing experience within the home context.  Results showed that children???s preference to sing at home, rather than at school, increases with age.  While boys have a stronger preference to sing at home than girls, girls are more positive towards school singing.  Relational reasons such as fear of criticism and singing in front of others were central reasons for children???s dislike of school singing.  While children across all stage levels enjoy singing with CD???s and singing on their own, boys??? particularly enjoy having ownership over song choice and composing their own songs.  Lack of song choice and singing in front of others evokes negative attitudes towards singing.  Teachers have a strong influence on attitudes towards singing at ES1 and Stage 1 level, however by Year 6, there is a strong correlation between parents and children???s attitudes towards singing. These results provide new insights and implications for the teaching of singing in schools.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Singing.</field><field name="subject">School children -- Attitudes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29583</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investment strategies for capacity expansion</field><field name="creator">Yang, Shu-Jung Sunny, The University of New South Wales. Australian Graduate School of Management, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses a problem at the nexus of operations, strategy, and economics: in concentrated markets, on the one hand firms may need to expand capacity in order to improve their competitive position, and on the other they also seek to avoid industry excess capacity causing poor industry conditions to destroy the intended value creation. These considerations are opposite to each other. Too much capacity leads to underutilized resources and drives costs up. In contrast, too little capacity will limit the operation's capability to serve customers and earn revenues.  The literature of the operations management and operations research fields on capacity expansion is concerned with normative perspectives to invoke optimization techniques. In this stream of research, competitive capacity expansion is not extensive. Operations related studies often ignore the effect of oligopolistic competition on investment activities but explicitly model practical operational environments.  Conversely, the literature of the industrial organization and business strategy fields on strategic investment focuses on quantity/pricing competition in oligopoly markets, and is concerned with descriptive perspectives to invoke game-theoretic modeling, emphasizing the effect of imperfect competition. There is an extensive literature of economics on a subject of capacity investment in oligopolistic competition environments. However, economics-related studies do not often address the detailed operational environments.  The thesis focuses on the following five complicated factors affecting the union of operations, strategy, and economics: existing capacity, economies of scale, realistic production strategy, strategic interaction, and demand uncertainty. We make two main contributions. First, we extend the current game-theoretic models of strategic capacity investment by explicitly considering existing capacity, scale economies, and realistic production rules, which are often considered in the operations literature. Under reasonable conditions, we are able to solve the proposed models in closed form. Our second contribution is to use the type of generic strategy as firms' decision variable rather than quantity, price, or timing, which is often used in oligopoly theory. After analyzing equilibrium behaviors in the proposed models, our findings are supported by many empirical observations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategy.</field><field name="subject">Investments.</field><field name="subject">Competition.</field><field name="subject">Capacity.</field><field name="subject">Announcement.</field><field name="subject">Production strategies: holdback and clearance</field><field name="subject">Oligopoly.</field><field name="subject">Endogenous sequencing.</field><field name="subject">Commitment.</field><field name="subject">Flexibility.</field><field name="subject">Operations management.</field><field name="subject">Supply chain management.</field><field name="subject">Operations research.</field><field name="subject">Capacity theory (Mathematics)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of high-elaborative, emotion-rich reminiscing on children???s development of autobiographical memory and emotion knowledge.</field><field name="creator">Wareham, Penny, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">High elaborative parent-child reminiscing plays a significant role in preschoolers??? development of autobiographical memory, and, given the emotional salience of many past events, may also contribute to the development of emotion knowledge and other socio-cognitive skills. Additionally, whilst research has traditionally focused on reminiscing style, emotional content may also be important for child outcomes. In Study 1, a naturalistic paradigm was employed to examine associations of parents??? reminiscing style and emotion references with children???s emotion knowledge. Twenty-five parent-child dyads each discussed four emotionally salient past events. It was found that high elaborative parents more often discussed emotions causes than did other parents; in turn, a high elaborative style and discussion of emotion causes were each uniquely associated with children???s emotion knowledge. In Study 2 an experimental paradigm was used to examine the impact of emotion-oriented reminiscing on 88 children???s memory for a staged, emotion-rich event. Two days after participating in the event, children reminisced with an experimenter in one of four ways. Emotion-cause, emotion-expression, and no-emotion reminiscing were all high elaborative but differed in emotion content. Minimal reminiscing was low elaborative. Children who participated in emotion-cause reminiscing and, to a lesser extent, emotion-expression reminiscing, recalled significantly more emotional and non-emotional information about the event than did children who participated in no-emotion or minimal reminiscing. Study 3 aimed to extend the findings of Studies 1 and 2 by training mothers to reminisce using a high elaborative style and emotion content. 80 dyads initially participated; 44 completed all stages. After training, mothers and children in the reminiscing condition each used a more elaborative style and discussed emotions more than did their counterparts in a powerful ???child directed play??? control condition. These differences were sustained across six months, at which time children in the reminiscing condition also showed better emotion cause knowledge than did children in the control condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that children???s autobiographical memory and emotion knowledge may each develop via shared reminiscing interactions in the preschool years. In each case, the role of high-elaborative, emotion-rich reminiscing is highlighted.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Memory.</field><field name="subject">Emotion.</field><field name="subject">Children.</field><field name="subject">Reminiscing.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimum resonance changer for submerged vessel signature reduction.</field><field name="creator">Dylejko, Paul Griffin, School of Mechanical Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In maritime vessels, it is desirable to minimise the structural and acoustic responses for several reasons, including passenger comfort, minimisation of crew fatigue, and in the case of military vessels, to avoid detection. The propeller-shafting system represents one of the most critical areas which must be addressed in order to reduce the low frequency acoustic signature. The propeller-shafting system is primarily excited by axial oscillations at the propeller. The force transmitted along the propeller-shafting system from these disturbances results in axial excitation of the hull and subsequent sound radiation. The aim of this thesis is to apply a combination of passive and active control techniques, in order to minimise the low frequency radiated noise signature of a pressure hull submerged in a fluid.  Dynamic models of the propeller-shafting system, foundation and cylindrical hull including complicating factors such as fluid loading, bulkheads and onboard equipment are developed and described using the transmission matrix approach. This modular description enables greater flexibility for dynamic modelling of the propeller shafting system, and can be easily manipulated for future design modifications. The far-field radiated sound pressure from the submarine hull is evaluated and related to the force delivered to the hull by the propeller-shafting system. A passive optimisation scheme involving a genetic and general non-linear constrained algorithm is used to minimise fitness functions associated with the vibration of the propeller, vibration transmission to the hull and far-field radiated sound pressure over a low frequency range. This results in optimal resonance changer parameters for single and multiple resonance changers in a variety of configurations.  A new quasi-adaptive resonance changer system is proposed and optimised to minimise the radiated sound pressure or propeller velocity. The optimal use of an adaptive resonance changer is investigated in both the frequency and time domains to reduce the hull velocity and subsequently the far-field radiated sound pressure. Fully active control is also evaluated by introducing a control force to the resonance changer with the aim of minimising either the propeller velocity or the radiated noise level. Finally, the concept of hybrid control is investigated by coupling passive, active and semi-active control techniques together to improve the overall performance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Submarines (Ships) -- Noise.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sexual harassment: Perceptions, measures and laws in Thailand.</field><field name="creator">Soonthornpasuch, Pongprad, School of Politics, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploration of perceptions of sexual harassment in Thailand, together with policies and measures against the practice. My main research questions are: How do Thai people perceive sexual harassment? And what can be done to combat and address sexual harassment in Thailand? My research also provides  recommendations for measures against sexual harassment in Thailand. The Thai term &amp;quot kan kukkam tang phet &amp;quot is used to convey ???sexual harassment??? in this study. The participants in my study understand kan kukkam tang phet as a broad term covering sexual behaviors that range from verbal harassment to rape. In general, the participants consider that sexual harassment is a big problem in Thailand. However, my research found that there are some perceptions and attitudes of Thai people that need to be dealt with as obstructions of measures against sexual harassment, such as blaming women as a cause of sexual harassment, anti-women prejudices, and the use of the excuse of cultural differences in implementing anti-sexual harassment laws. In regard to the question of legislation addressing sexual harassment in Thailand and what can be done to help to counter it, my findings are that Thailand has no clear approach to sexual harassment; no clear legal definition of sexual harassment; no specific authority or organization at the national level to redress sexual harassment; and no statistics on sexual harassment by national surveys. The promotion of awareness of sexual harassment has not yet been the subject of formal campaigns. My thesis presents recommendations to address sexual harassment in Thailand, through both legal measures and social measures. The legal measures proposed are sexual harassment law, a code of practice, and revision of the Penal Code. I suggest that sexual harassment law should be based on an ???anti-discrimination??? approach, to be consistent with the obligations of Thailand to implement suitable measures to give effect to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Social measures including education, campaigns and surveys on sexual harassment in the Thai community are also recommended in terms of raising the understanding of the concept and awareness of the issue.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sexual harassment -- Thailand.</field><field name="subject">Sexual harassment -- Law and legislation -- Thailand.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post???deposition processing of polycrystalline silicon thin???film solar cells on low???temperature glass superstrates</field><field name="creator">Terry, Mason L, Photovoltaic &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In polycrystalline silicon (pc-Si) thin-film solar cells, defect passivation is critical to device performance. Isoelectronic or covalently bonded impurities, hydrogenic, extended defects and defects with localized levels in the bandgap (deep level defects) are typically introduced during the fabrication of, and/or are inherent to, pc-Si thin-film solar cells. These defects dramatically affect minority carrier lifetimes. Removing and/or passivating these defects is required to maximize minority carrier lifetimes and is typically done through thermal annealing and passivation techniques. For pc-Si thin-film solar cells on low temperature glass superstrates, rapid thermal annealing (RTA) and hydrogen plasma passivation (hydrogenation) are powerful techniques to achieve effective removal and passivation of these defects.  In this thesis, three silicon thin-film solar cells structures on low-temperature glass are subjected to variations in RTA high-temperature plateaus, RTA plateau times, and hydrogen plasma passivation parameters. These solar cells are referred to as ALICIA, EVA and PLASMA. By varying the RTA plateau temperature and time at plateau, the trade-off between extensive dopant diffusion and maximum defect removal is optimized. To reduce the density of point defects and to electrically activate the majority of dopants, an RTA process is shown to be essential. For all three of the thin-film solar cell structures investigated in this thesis, a shorter, higher-temperature RTA process provides the best open-circuit voltage (Voc). Extensive RTA plateau times cause excessive dopant smearing, increasing n = 2 recombination and shunt resistance losses.  Hydrogenation is shown to be an essential step to achieve maximum device performance by `healing' the defects inherent to pc-Si thin-film solar cells. If the hydrogen concentration is about 1-2 times the density of oxygen in the cells as measured by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), the cells seem to respond best to hydrogenation, with good resultant Voc and short-circuit for all cells investigated in this thesis. The effect of hydrogen passivation on the Voc is spectacular, typically increasing it by a factor of 2 to 3.5. Hydrogen de-bonding from repeated thermal treatments at increasing temperature provides a deeper understanding of what defects exist and the nature of the defects that limit the cell voltage.  The variation in RTA and hydrogenation process parameters produces significant empirical insight into the effectiveness of RTA processes for point defect removal, dopant activation, point defect and grain boundary passivation, and impurity passivation. SIMS measurements are used to determine the impurities present in the cells' bulk and the amount of hydrogen available to passivate defects. From the results presented it appears that pc-Si thin-film solar cells on low-temperature glass are a promising, and potentially lower-cost, alternative to Si wafer based cells.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thin film.</field><field name="subject">Silicon.</field><field name="subject">Solar cells.</field><field name="subject">Rapid thermal.</field><field name="subject">Hydrogen passivation.</field><field name="subject">Hydrogenation.</field><field name="subject">Glass.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hardware Implementation Techniques for JPEG2000.</field><field name="creator">Dyer, Michael Ian, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">JPEG2000 is a recently standardized image compression system that provides substantial improvements over the existing JPEG compression scheme. This improvement in performance comes with an associated cost in increased implementation complexity, such that a purely software implementation is inefficient. This work identifies the arithmetic coder as a bottleneck in efficient hardware implementations, and explores various design options to improve arithmetic coder speed and size. The designs produced improve the critical path of the existing arithmetic coder designs, and then extend the coder throughput to 2 or more symbols per clock cycle. Subsequent work examines more system level implementation issues. This work examines the communication between hardware blocks and utilizes certain modes of operation to add flexibility to buffering solutions. It becomes possible to significantly reduce the amount of intermediate buffering between blocks, whilst maintaining a loose synchronization. Full hardware implementations of the standard are necessarily limited in the amount of features that they can offer, in order to constrain complexity and cost. To circumvent this, a hardware / software codesign is produced using the Altera NIOS II softcore processor. By keeping the majority of the standard implemented in software and using hardware to accelerate those time consuming functions, generality of implementation can be retained, whilst implementation speed is improved. In addition to this, there is the opportunity to explore parallelism, by providing multiple identical hardware blocks to code multiple data units simultaneously.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">JPEG2000.</field><field name="subject">VLSI.</field><field name="subject">Hardware acceleration.</field><field name="subject">JPEG (Image coding standard)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Techno-economic modelling of CO2 capture systems for Australian industrial sources.</field><field name="creator">Ho, Minh Trang Thi, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Australia is recognising that carbon capture and storage (CCS) may be a feasible pathway for addressing increasing levels of CO2 emissions. This thesis presents a preliminary economic assessment and comparison of the capture costs for different Australian CO2 emission sources. The capture technologies evaluated include solvent absorption, pressure swing adsorption (PSA), gas separation membranes and low temperature separation. The capture cost estimated for hydrogen production, IGCC power plants and natural gas processing is less than A$30/tonne CO2 avoided. CO2 capture cost for iron production ranges from A$30 to A$40 per tonne CO2 avoided. Higher costs of A$40 to over A$80 per tonne CO2 avoided were estimated for flue gas streams from pulverised coal and NGCC power plants, oil refineries and cement facilities, and IDGCC synthesis gas. Based on 2004 and 2005 EU ETS carbon prices (A$30 to A$45 per tonne CO2 avoided), the cost of capture using current commercially available absorption technology may deter wide-scale implementation of CCS, in particular for combustion processes. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to explore the opportunities for reducing costs. The high cost for capture using solvent absorption is dependent on the energy needed for solvent regeneration and the high capital costs. Cost reductions can be achieved by using new low regeneration energy solvents coupled with recycling the waste heat from the absorption process back to the steam cycle, and using low cost ???fit-for-purpose??? equipment. For membrane and PSA technologies, the capture costs are dominated by the flue gas and post-capture compressors. Operating the permeate or desorption stream under vacuum conditions provides significant cost reductions. Improvements in membrane and adsorbent characteristics such as the adsorbent loading or membrane permeability, CO2 selectivity, and lower prices for the membrane or adsorbent material provide further cost benefits. For low partial pressure CO2 streams, capture using low temperature ???anti-sublimation??? separation can be an alternative option. Low costs could be achieved by operating under low pressures and integrating with external sources of waste heat.  Applying the cost reductions achievable with technology and process improvements reduces the capture and CCS costs to a level less than current carbon prices, making CCS an attractive mitigation option.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CO2 capture.</field><field name="subject">Techno-economic modelling.</field><field name="subject">Absorption.</field><field name="subject">Membranes.</field><field name="subject">Carbon dioxide -- Economic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Carbon dioxide -- Industrial applications.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional characterisation of novel mast cell genes.</field><field name="creator">Sisavanh, Mary, Biotechnology &amp; biomolecular sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The development of microarray technology has provided an unprecedented wealth of data on gene expression in various tissue and cell types. Few studies have, however, taken full advantage of these data by selecting and then extensively characterising the functions of particular genes chosen from these microarray datasets. In this study, after analysing differentially-regulated genes revealed by microarray analysis of human mast cells activated via Fc??RI cross-linking, we chose two promising gene candidates for further research, A20 and Gem. Our group??s extensive gene expression database of major leukocytes showed that both A20 and Gem were up-regulated in other leukocyte types, and yet neither of these genes has been extensively explored in mast cells or in the immune system prior to our study. In order to investigate the first of these genes selected for further study, A20, we utilised both A20-deficient mast cells and mast cells in which A20 was over-expressed. Our findings establish for the first time that A20 is an important regulator of mast cell inflammatory responses to both LPS and Fc??RI cross-linking, and that it plays a novel role in mast cell proliferation. Our study of the second gene chosen for investigation, Gem, was conducted in a Gemdeficient mouse model developed by our group. In this study, we investigated the effect of Gem deficiency in two key immune cell types, macrophages and T-cells, complementing the work of a previous group member who investigated Gem deficiency in mast cells. Our results clearly exclude a role for Gem in macrophage and T-cell effector responses, and further establish that Gem is dispensable for in vivo inflammatory responses in models of delayed-type hypersensitivity and allergic airway inflammation. In addition to these findings, and given that the physiological role of Gem was not yet understood prior to our study, we extended our investigation to explore a potential function for Gem in the metabolic system. Using Gem-deficient mice, we found that Gem is necessary for insulin secretion from pancreatic islets. These findings confirm the potential for microarray expression data to reveal excellent gene candidates for further research and functional characterisation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microarray</field><field name="subject">Mast cells</field><field name="subject">A20</field><field name="subject">Gem GTPase</field><field name="subject">Insulin secretion</field><field name="subject">Gene expression.</field><field name="subject">Microarray Analysis -- methods.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainability and the struggle for hegemony in Australian architectural education.</field><field name="creator">Graham, Peter M., School of Architecture, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study is situated within the contested fields of architectural education and sustainable development. It seeks to identify ideological positions within discourses related to these fields in order to explain documented resistance to the integration of sustainable design curricula in architectural education. To understand resistance to such integration we must go beyond identifying the problem. To affect curriculum change it is necessary not only to have a design for a desired state, but also to gain the power to implement it. This assumption demands both an understanding of the power relations that support the status quo and an acceptance of curriculum development as a process of ideological struggle. Hence, efforts to reform architectural education need to be informed by an understanding of the hegemonic struggles which shape architectural curricula. Existing research in the field of sustainable design education has not focussed on such issues. International studies have not considered curricula as manifestations of a history of ideological struggle. Nor have detailed studies of sustainable design education in schools of architecture been conducted in Australia. This study has addressed these knowledge gaps by investigating histories of ideas in architectural and sustainability education. A critical discourse analysis was conducted of the handbook descriptions of architectural courses in Sydney over the last thirty years, and of courses offered in 2007 by all Australian schools of architecture. This analysis was supported by curriculum mapping to reveal the power relations inherent in architectural curricula. The research has identified strategies of hegemonic struggle which affect the hegemony of ideologies in Australian architectural education and the positioning of sustainable design curricula within this contested field. I have found that sustainable design curricula are marginalised in Australian architecture courses and that this marginalisation has been historically constructed. I have also exposed hegemonic strategies that reproduce such marginalisation within curricula.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The I3A Framework: enhancing the sustainability of off-grid photovoltaic energy service delivery in Indonesia.</field><field name="creator">Retnanestri, Maria Immaculata Taufi, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since the 1980s, approximately 10 MWp photovoltaic (PV) power has been installed in off-grid areas in Indonesia for powering lighting, water pumping, communications, health clinics, etc. However, PV energy systems (PVES) have yet to prove their sustainability and remain inaccessible to many remote Indonesian communities. The objective of this interdisciplinary thesis is to draw on social and engineering perspectives to address sustainability issues related to off-grid PVES delivery in Indonesia. By employing the Brundtland definition of sustainability, off-grid PVES delivery is analysed with respect to its institutional, financial, technical, social and ecological sustainability. In parallel, the thesis also investigates PVES Accessibility, Availability and Acceptability (3A), referring to the three energy goals proposed by the World Energy Council. The concepts of Sustainable Development, Social Capital, and Diffusion of Innovation are employed to examine the potential for off-grid PVES to contribute to improving the sustainability of remote Indonesian communities. The I3A (Implementation, 3A) Sustainable PVES Delivery framework is proposed to investigate PVES sustainability and the extent to which local communities can continue to socially innovate to meet their evolving needs beyond initial project completion. Sound project management (PM) is essential as off-grid PVES projects can only access limited resources (time, funds, and scope) and project failure can undermine a community???s capacity to innovate. The research methodologies include literature research, qualitative field research in villages where PVES has been installed and interviews with a wide range of PVES stakeholders in Indonesia. The I3A framework is tested against three off-grid PVES case studies from Lampung, West Java and NTT Provinces and is also proposed as a design tool. A key conclusion is that, to be sustainable and equitable, off-grid PVES projects should be implemented in an institutional framework that provides sound project management and addresses PVES accessibility (financial, institutional and technological), availability (technical quality and continuity) and acceptability (social and ecological). The overall objectives are to acknowledge the interests of all stakeholders, maximise equity, assure PVES continuity, and institutionalize PVES by utilizing and enhancing preexisting community resources to leave the community with the capacity to socially innovate. While this might be regarded as idealistic, enhanced local autonomy and capability will be essential in the context of the energy security and climate change challenges that humanity now faces.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Photovoltaic power systems.</field><field name="subject">Project management.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of alternative idea generation techniques in audit  fraud risk assessments.</field><field name="creator">Khalifa, Amna Saeed, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Recent international regulatory reforms have put more responsibility on auditors for detecting financial statement fraud. The recent changes to international auditing standards make it compulsory for members of the audit team to discuss the susceptibility of an entity to fraudulent misstatements at the audit planning stage. These standards do not stipulate the format of these group discussions, nor provide any explicit guidelines on how to carry out effective discussions. This dissertation reports on two studies that examine different discussion techniques which could lead to a better identification of audit fraud risks at the audit planning stage, and may in turn help in fraud detection. Study One tests whether two enhanced forms of interacting group processes (brainstorming guidelines and premortem instructions) have advantages over an interacting group (without brainstorming guidelines). The brainstorming group is provided with Osborn???s (1957) original brainstorming guidelines. Premortem is a variation of the mental simulation idea developed by Klein (1999) invoking a scenario where participants actively search for a flaw in their plans. The auditors in both the brainstorming group treatment and the premortem group treatment generated a larger number of potential frauds than the interacting group treatment. These results were robust across a range of dependent variables used to measure quantity and quality of fraud items. The results also show that more premortem groups listed rare frauds compared to the other two group structures. There was a negative relationship between the number of items listed and the assessed likelihood of fraud. Participants who estimated a higher likelihood of fraud provided a more complete mental simulation of how a fraud could be perpetrated. Study Two focuses on the individual brainstorming phase which may occur before the group brainstorming session. It examines whether giving additional brainstorming guidelines and task decomposing (in addition to the original brainstorming guidelines), improve performance compared to having only the original brainstorming guidelines. Both the additional brainstorming guidelines and the task decomposition treatments generated a larger number of potential frauds than the brainstorming guidelines treatment. Task decomposition helps participants focus equally on all task subcategories leading to a more diverse set of ideas.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Risk assessment.</field><field name="subject">Auditing -- Evaluation.</field><field name="subject">Auditing -- Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Costs and consequences: understanding the impact of fostering on carers.</field><field name="creator">McHugh, Marilyn, School of Social Science &amp; Policy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on a study examining the direct and indirect costs to volunteer carers of providing a fostering service in Australia. The study highlights the current difficulties in carer recruitment and retention, the increases in the challenging and complex needs of the children coming into care, and the growing professionalism of fostering. The study uses a budgetary approach to estimate the direct costs of fostered children. In-depth interviews and focus groups with carers are instrumental in providing a range of perspectives that assist our understanding of how the direct costs of fostered children are different from (higher than) the costs of other children. The study found the costs of fostered children were 40 per cent higher than the costs of children not in care. The thesis indicates that, to maintain and retain a volunteer workforce, an adequate carer remuneration system to meet the direct costs of fostered children is critical. To examine the indirect costs of fostering, the study uses a multi-method approach providing a monetary value of the opportunity costs (foregone earnings model) and time costs (proxy good or market replacement model) for foster carers. The emotional and psychological dimensions of fostering are also examined, though no monetary value is assigned to these costs. Carers??? vivid and contrasting stories from the interviews explain how ???money??? fits with carer motivation and fostering???s more professional role, how carers perceive the nature of fostering (job or parenting), and whether carers should be paid to foster. Revelations of fostering???s emotional and time dimensions and restricted employment opportunities (indirect costs) highlight the impact fostering has on carers and their families. The study found that the indirect costs of fostered children were around four times the value of the direct costs. In light of the growing professionalism of contemporary foster care, difficulties in carer recruitment/retention, and the demanding nature of fostering, the thesis examines whether carers should be paid for the service they provide (compensation for indirect costs). Using a number of theoretical concepts developed by feminist economists and social theorists on paying for caring labour, the thesis found support for the contention that altruism (???love???) and carer pay (???money???) are not incompatible, and ambiguities and tensions for foster mothers around money and love can be resolved. Studies of countries where carers receive a wage component as part of their remuneration package provide insights into wage levels, perceived adequacy of the wage, and the impact of wages on carer recruitment/retention. The study found that, due to the profoundly gendered nature of fostering, the compensatory aspects of remuneration (fee/wage or salary) are generally poor. The implications for government welfare spending of paying Australian carers are discussed, and the savings to governments of using a volunteer workforce are demonstrated.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foster children.</field><field name="subject">Volunteers.</field><field name="subject">Cost.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31469</field></doc><doc><field name="title">???Bury, burn or dump???: black humour in the late twentieth century.</field><field name="creator">Murray, Kristen A, School of Media, Theatre &amp; Film &amp; School of Sociology, UNSW</field><field name="description">In humour studies research, there have been few attempts to elucidate why black humour was such a prevalent, powerful force in late twentieth century culture and why it continues to make a profound impression in the new millennium. As Dana Polan (1991) laments: ???Rarely have there been attempts to offer material, historically specific explanations of particular manifestations of the comic???.1 This thesis offers an interdisciplinary analysis of black humour in the late twentieth century. I contend that the experience of black humour emerges from the intricacies of human beliefs and behaviours surrounding death and through the diverse rituals that shape experiences of loss. I suggest that black humour is an attempt to articulate the tension between the haunting absence and disturbing presence of death in contemporary society. Chapter 1 of this thesis offers an historical and etymological perspective on black humour. In Chapter 2, I argue that the increasing privatisation and medicalisation of death, along with the overt mediatisation of death, creates a problematic juxtaposition. I contend that these unique social conditions created, and continue to foster, an ideal environment for the creation and proliferation of black humour. In Chapters 3 and 4, I examine the structures and functions of black humour through three key theories of humour: incongruity, catharsis and superiority. Chapter 5 looks at ways in which the experience of black humour creates resolutions and forces dissonances for people entwined with loss. In this final chapter, I also consider how black humour may help people make meaning from issues surrounding death. Throughout this theoretical discussion, I interweave the analysis of a range of scenes from contemporary black comic texts (i.e. plays, screenplays and television scripts). On the whole, this thesis works towards a more complex, specific understanding of the phenomenon of black humour within a social context.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Black humour.</field><field name="subject">Black comedy.</field><field name="subject">Gallows humour.</field><field name="subject">Dark comedy.</field><field name="subject">Humour studies.</field><field name="subject">Incongruity theory.</field><field name="subject">Catharsis theory.</field><field name="subject">Superiority theory.</field><field name="subject">Death.</field><field name="subject">Dying.</field><field name="subject">Grief.</field><field name="subject">Coping mechanism.</field><field name="subject">Media violence.</field><field name="subject">Theatre.</field><field name="subject">Film.</field><field name="subject">Television.</field><field name="subject">Sociology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic economic integration.</field><field name="creator">Teo, Ernie G. S., Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The French and Dutch refusal to ratify the European Constitution in 2005 and the collapse of many East German businesses post-reunification; are just some examples of the hurdles integrating nations face. Integration of nations affects many economic factors such as public good allocation, trade, production, labour, consumption and even macro-economic policy instruments. Therefore, it is important to understand what motivates integration. Few scholars have broached the subject of the integration of nations (see Goyal and Staal (2004)), where size asymmetry and historical dependence are considered. Starting with Alesina and Spolaore (2003)'s Size of Nations symmetric framework, we attempt to do this with a two nation (asymmetric in size) location model. The key findings are that size differentials and the constitutional design (the identity of the decision maker) matters. In this thesis, we consider the social planner (government) and voters. The social planner maximizes social welfare for his own nation. Voting outcomes become non-trivial as it depends on the number of alternatives and the voting system. We categorize integration into two main forms. Full Integration is when the two nations fully integrate to form a new one, only one capital remains. Federated Integration is where the nations integrate but retain some form of sovereignty; this is represented by the retention of both capitals. Size difference matters when two nations chose to integrate. As the size difference between the two nations increase it becomes harder for integration to occur; nations would integrate if there is no size difference. The identity of the decision maker will affect the threshold on size.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics.</field><field name="subject">Decision-making.</field><field name="subject">Intergroup relations.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31492</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of novel molecular markers from the WNT pathway : a stepwise regression model for pancreatic cancer survival.</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Amanda Caroline, St Vincent???s Hospital Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Optimisation of the conventional tripartite of pancreatic cancer (PC) treatment have led to significant improvements in mortality, however further knowledge of the underlying molecular processes is still required. Transcript profiling of mRNA expression of over 44K genes with microarray technology demonstrated upregulation of secreted frizzled related protein 4 (sFRP4) and  ??-catenin in PC compared to normal pancreata. Their pathway ??? Wnt signalling is integral to transcriptional regulation and aberrations in these molecules are critical in the development of many human malignancies. Immunohistochemistry protocols were evaluated by two independent blinded examiners for antigen expression differences associated with survival patterns in 140 patients with biopsy verified PC and a subset of 23 normal pancreata with substantial observer agreement (kappa value 0.6-0.8). A retrospective cohort was identified from 6 Sydney hospitals between 1972-2003 and archival formalin fixed tissue was collected together with clinicopathological data. Three manual stepwise regression models were fitted for overall, disease-specific and relapse-free survival to determine the value of significant prognostic variables in risk stratification. The models were fitted in a logical order using a careful strategy with step by step interpretation of the results. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased sFRP4 membranous expression (&amp;gt 10%) in 49/95 PC specimens and this correlated with improved overall survival (HR:0.99;95%CI:0.97-6.40;LRchi2=134.75; 1df; ??&amp;lt 0.001). Increased sFRP4 cytoplasmic staining (&amp;gt  2/3) in 46/85 patients increased the disease-specific survival  (HR:0.52;95%CI:0.31-0.89;LR test statistic =248.40;1df;??&amp;lt 0.001). Increasing ??-catenin membranous expression (&amp;lt _60%) in 26/116 patients was associated with an increased risk of overall death (HR:3.18;95%CI:1.14-8.89;LR test statistic =4.61;1df,??&amp;lt 0.05). Increasing cytoplasmic expression in 65/114 patients was protective and was associated with prolonged survival on univariate, but not multivariate analysis (Disease specific survival HR:0.75;95%CI:0.56-1.00;logrank chi2=3.91;1df; ??=0.05). Increased nuclear ??-catenin expression in 65/114 patients was associated with prolonged survival (disease-specific HR:0.92;95%CI:0.83-1.02; LR test statistic= 49.72;1df;??&amp;lt 0.001). At the conclusion, 12 patients (8.6%) remained alive, 122 died of their disease (68 males versus 54 females). They were followed for a median of 8.7 months (range 1.0-131.3) months. The median age was 66.5 years (range 34.4-96.0, standard deviation 10.9) years. Pancreatic resection was achieved in 79 patients with 46.8% achieving RO resection. The 30 day post-operative mortality was 2.1%. The overall 1 year survival rate was (33.7% ; 95%CI: 25.78-33.79) with a 5 year survival of (2.87%, 95%CI: 2.83-6.01) and a median survival of (8.90 months; 95%CI: 7.5-10.2). The median disease-specific survival was (9.40; 95%CI: 7.9-10.5 months) and the median time to relapse was 1.2 months (95%CI 1.0-1.2 months). A central tenet of contemporary cancer research is that an understanding of the genetic and molecular abnormalities that accompany the development and progression of cancer is critical to further advances in diagnosis, treatment and eventual prevention.

At the same time, there are many employees who, despite being exposed to frequent and persistent bullying in the workplace do not label themselves bullied. This thesis investigated a number of behavioural, individual and contextual variables that were predicted to have an influence on the perceived severity of workplace bullying behaviours and the actual labelling of the behaviours as bullying using established workplace bullying measures and vignettes. Overall, the results indicated that the perceived severity and labelling of workplace bullying behaviours were influenced by the behaviours involved, by characteristics of the employee being subjected to the behaviours, by characteristics of the employee perpetrating the behaviours and by the connection that the target???s co-workers had to the bullying interaction. Specifically, the analyses indicated that behaviours that personally ridiculed the target were perceived as severe and as bullying more frequently than other categories of bullying behaviour. Participant gender and current experience with workplace bullying were also revealed to be predictive of whether negative workplace behaviours were perceived as severe and bullying in nature. The formal position held by the perpetrator relative to the target was revealed to influence whether the behaviours were perceived as severe. The formal position of the perpetrator, the presence of others during the bullying act and the knowledge that others in the workplace were also being targeted significantly influenced whether the behaviours were labelled as bullying in nature.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bullying in the workplace.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular mechanism of cancer related to urokinase receptor: DNAzyme-mediated inhibition and Novel protein interactors of urokinase receptor</field><field name="creator">Lin, Zhen, St George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">The urokinase receptor (uPAR) plays a central role in metastatic process. It???s evident uPAR is overexpressed across a variety of tumour cells and leads to the increased aggressiveness and poor prognosis of cancer. Inhibition of uPAR expression can block metastatic potential in many tumours. In addition, besides uPA, there are several other proteins which have been confirmed to interact with uPAR, such as vitronectin and integrins. These interactions also contribute to signal transduction and the functions of uPAR complex. Therefore, downregulation of uPAR expression by targeting uPAR mRNA or protein, or by regulating the uPAR partners would be potential therapeutic strategies for prevention of cancer metastasis. There are two main aspects contained in this thesis. Firstly, three specific DNAzymes targeting uPAR mRNA were designed to downregulate uPAR expression in vitro and their effects to decrease cancer cell invasion studied in a human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2. The results showed that two of them (Dz483 and Dz720) cleaved uPAR transcript in vitro with high efficacy and specificity and the Dz720 inhibited uPAR protein levels by 55% in Saos-2 cells. Besides, the Dz720 significantly suppressed Saos-2 cell invasion using an in vitro matrigel assay. Secondly, two potential uPAR partners from yeast two-hybrid screening, a heat shock protein MRJ and an anti-apoptosis protein HAX-1, were characterised and their functions binding with uPAR investigated. The interactions were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation, GST-pull down assay and confocal microscopy in cancer cells. In addition, there was a 50% increase in cell adhesion after transfection with MRJ. This increase in adhesion is dependent on the uPAR/full length MRJ interaction as cells transfected with the mutant construct containing only N-terminal region or C-terminal region of MRJ had no increase in cell adhesion. The observed increase in adhesion to vitronectin by MRJ was also blocked by an anti-uPAR domain I antibody suggesting that the induced adhesion is at least in part contributed by uPAR on the cell surface. Together, the identification of both MRJ and HAX-1 as uPAR interactors provides further insight into the intricate relationship between uPAR and other proteins which may develop potential approaches for cancer therapy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Urokinase receptor.</field><field name="subject">DNAzyme.</field><field name="subject">Heat shock protein MRJ.</field><field name="subject">HAX-1.</field><field name="subject">Protein interaction.</field><field name="subject">Inhibition.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31893</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mental health prevention: design and evaluation of an internet-delivered universal program for use in schools with  adolescents.</field><field name="creator">van Vliet, Helen E, Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research describes the design and evaluation of an internet-based universal program for use in schools with adolescent students to prevent common mental disorders and promote mental health. The research began in response to investigations that showed that rates of mental illness in Australian children, teenagers and adults were high, that these illnesses caused significant burden to individuals and society, and that there were insufficient services to treat. When current interventions are unable to alleviate disease burden it is important to focus on prevention. Mental health prevention should target youth before disorders cause disability and restriction of life choices. A review of the mental health prevention literature supported a universal cognitive behavioural approach in schools. Internet delivery was used to maintain content integrity, enable access to people living in regional and remote areas, and to appeal to young people. Internet delivery makes universal prevention cost effective and feasible. The Intervention Mapping approach was used to direct the design of the program. A feasibility study was conducted to gain opinions from students and teaching staff. Changes were made in light of results from this study and 463 students were then exposed to the program in an effectiveness trial. The effectiveness trial was a before-after design with no control group. Results from this trial provided evidence that the program was acceptable and effective for use by teachers in the intervention schools. Also student behaviour and mood changed in beneficial ways after program administration. Specifically, student reported significantly increased knowledge about stress and coping, use of help-seeking behaviours, and life satisfaction, and significantly decreased use of avoidance behaviours, total difficulties and psychological distress. The study design allows causal inferences to be surmised concerning exposure to the intervention and changes in behaviour and mood, but further evidence is needed before firm conclusions about effectiveness can be posited and generalizations made concerning different populations, settings and times. In conclusion, this thesis provides evidence that a computerised, cognitive behavioural mental health prevention program delivered to adolescent school students by teachers can potentially change student coping behaviours and mood in beneficial ways.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental health.</field><field name="subject">Mental health promotion -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Students.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31899</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inflammatory imbalance in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.</field><field name="creator">Oei, Ju Lee, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Abstract  Introduction: Current evidence suggests that the lungs of infants with the debilitating disorder, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), react to the challenges of extra-uterine adaptation with inappropriately aggressive inflammation. The reasons for this are not entirely clear and this study hypothesizes that a deficiency of interleukin (IL)-10, a potent anti-inflammatory mediator, leads to the functional and architectural changes characteristic of BPD.   Aim: To characterize the behaviour of IL-10 and neutrophil apoptosis in the tracheal fluids (TF) of infants at risk of developing BPD. Method: TF from intubated infants of varying gestations at the Royal Hospital for Women, Randwick was spun and ILs 8, 10 and 16 were measured in the supernatant. The residual pellets of white cells were used to determine differential white cell counts and neutrophil apoptosis. Results: None of the 20 TF specimens from the extremely premature infants with BPD (n=11) had detectable IL-10, compared to 14/20(70%) of the specimens from preterm infants without BPD (n=20) and to 5/19 (26%) of the specimens from term infants (n=19). BPD infants also had a significantly lower number of apoptotic neutrophils during the 1st week of life. Premature infants with TF IL-10 &amp;gt5pg/ml did not develop BPD. Levels of IL-8, a neutrophil chemotaxin, and white cell counts, while not differing significantly between the groups, increased considerably towards the end of the first week of life in the BPD group. IL-16, a chemotaxin for inflammatory CD4+ cells, was also detected in more BPD than non-BPD specimens (BPD: 16/46 (35%) v 1/30 (0.3%) non-BPD preterm and 2/7 (28%) term TF specimens). Conclusions: Extremely premature infants prone to BPD have decreased pulmonary anti-inflammatory activity as demonstrated by decreased IL-10 and apoptotic neutrophils in tracheal fluids. The lack of a counter-regulatory response to the inflammatory processes that are an inevitable consequence of extra-uterine adaptation may therefore place the extremely premature newborn infant at a considerable risk of developing BPD.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IL-10.</field><field name="subject">Il-8.</field><field name="subject">Il-16.</field><field name="subject">Neutrophil apoptosis.</field><field name="subject">Bronchopulmonary dysplasia.</field><field name="subject">Inflammation -- Treatment.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transient viral infection of plant tissue culture and plants for production of virus and foreign protein</field><field name="creator">Shih, Sharon Min-Hsuan , Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work was aimed to investigate the basic viral infection protocols mainly focusing on Nicotiana benthamiana hairy root cultures and wild-type tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). The application of transgenic virus containing the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP) for foreign protein production in plant tissue cultures and whole plants was also studied. The effect on viral accumulation of the form of plant tissue culture used, such as hairy roots, shooty teratomas and suspended cells, was investigated. Viral infection was shown to have no effect on culture growth and morphology. Hairy root cultures are a superior host for viral propagation and production in vitro. The maximum specific rate of viral accumulation occurred mainly during the root growth phase. The average maximum virus concentration in the hairy roots was 0.82 ?? 0.14 mg g-1 dry weight and virus protein represented a maximum of approximately 6% of total soluble protein in the root biomass. Proportional scale-up of TMVinfected hairy roots in shake flasks and bioreactors can be achieved without changing the average virus concentration accumulated in the hairy roots. The level of viral accumulation was much lower in N. benthamiana hairy roots infected with transgenic virus containing GFP (TMVGFPC3) compared with TMV and low levels or no GFP was detected. Viral accumulation and GFP production in whole plants was studied using different generations of transgenic TMV-GFPC3 virus. Hybrid viruses with the foreign gene GFPC3 deleted may have been formed in successive TMV-GFPC3 generations, resulting in the loss of GFP production and enhanced viral infectivity. In vitro generated RNA transcript and first generation TMV-GFPC3 were found to be more suitable for infection than the second generation TMV-GFPC3. However, the accumulation of GFP and virus concentration did not occur at the same ratio. Provided a more genetically stable transgenic viral vector is used for infection, transient viral infection of hairy roots can be a potential alternative system for foreign protein production than plants grown in the field as the containment or safety issues can be addressed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Viral production.</field><field name="subject">Plant tissue culture.</field><field name="subject">Transient viral infection.</field><field name="subject">Foreign protein production.</field><field name="subject">Virus diseases of plants.</field><field name="subject">Proteins -- Synthesis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/34967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ballistic transport in one-dimensional p-type GaAs devices</field><field name="creator">Klochan, Oleh V, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis we study GaAs one dimensional hole systems with strong spin-orbit interaction effects.

This enhancement is explained by the confinement induced reorientation of the total angular momentum ^ J from perpendicular to the 2D plane to in-plane and parallel to the wire. We use the intrinsic anisotropy of the in-plane g-factors to probe the 0:7 structure and the zero bias anomaly in 1D hole wires. We find that the behaviour of the 0:7 structure and the ZBA are correlated and depend strongly on the orientation of the in-plane field. This result proves the connection between the 0:7 and the ZBA and their relation to spin. We fabricate the first induced hole 1D wire with extremely stable gate characteristics and characterize this device. We also fabricate devices with two orthogonal induced hole wires on one chip, to study the interplay between the confinement, crystallographic anisotropy and spin-orbit coupling and their effect on the Zeeman splitting. We find that the ratios of the g-factors in the two orthogonal field directions for the two wires show opposite behaviour. We compare absolute values of the g-factors relative to the magnetic field direction. For B || [011] the g-factor is large for the wire along [011] and small for the wire along [233]. Whereas for B || [233], the g-factors are large irrespective of the wire direction. The former result can be explained by reorientation of ^ J along the wire, and the latter by an additional off-diagonal Zeeman term, which leads to the out-of-plane component of ^ J when B || [233], and as a result, to enhanced g-factors via increased exchange interactions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Holes -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Anisotropy -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Magnetic fields.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35186</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of multi-component nucleic acid enzymes(MNAzymes)for the detection of analytes</field><field name="creator">Mokany, Elisa, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nucleic acids.</field><field name="subject">Enzymes -- Analysis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of polarised light microscopy as a non-invasive tool for early assessment of human oocytes and embryos</field><field name="creator">Kilani, Suha, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The overall aim was to evaluate a non-invasive technique for the assessment of oocytes and embryos using polarized light microscopy (PolScope-LC) with the goal of improving success rates in IVF. A literature review revealed little validation of the PolScope techniques in published work. A reproducible and accurate method for measuring the zona pellucida (ZP) thickness and density involving the PolScope computer software was validated by achieving low coefficient of variance and small inter/intra observer errors. Utilizing this method, 1477 oocytes from 211 stimulated cycles were analysed in this thesis. Results showed that increasing age has an adverse effect on the ZP thickness and density. Study of extended culturing of embryos showed that the ZP starts thinning as early as day 3 and embryos tend to have denser zonas over time. Standardisation of timing of PolScope observations in relation to the meiotic spindle was studied. Metaphase II oocytes were examined sequentially in culture from aspiration until microinjection using the PolScope The spindle is a highly dynamic structure that can appear and disappear over time in culture. A visible spindle was detected in 58% of the oocytes immediately after aspiration. This percentage increased until it stabilised at 39-40hrs post hCG and then declined significantly. Average spindle signal intensity increased over time reaching its peak at 39-40hrs post hCG, then declined significantly by 40.5hrs post hCG. The importance of spindle presence and morphology was investigated by following up embryos created after sperm injection at 39-40hrs post hCG. There was a significant relationship between normal meiotic spindle shape and density and embryo quality. A higher percentage of ???usable??? embryos, and all of pregnancies, arose from oocytes with a normal barrel shaped spindle. Finally, the impact of two issues related to spindle formation - the type of hCG used to trigger oocyte maturation and the site of microinjection during ICSI were assessed using the PolScope. The results showed a biological difference in spindle formation and embryo quality between rhCG and uhCG. In a separate randomised trial embryo quality was better when injecting the sperm in the vegetal pole away from the spindle during ICSI. The results from this thesis suggest that PolScope, if appropriately applied, may assist in improving IVF outcome.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ovum.</field><field name="subject">Embryos.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The watery eye</field><field name="creator">Francis, Ian C, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The notion surfaces that, as fish evolved, left the sea and colonised the land, they then needed not only a supply of tears for their ocular surface to function, but also a means by which tears could be eliminated. The fascinating study of abnormalities of this system, which are common, frequently debilitating, and can be challenging to manage, is the purpose of this thesis. An attempt has been made initially to assess our current state of knowledge in the Introduction. In subsequent chapters, new concepts including plerolacrima, temporal plical shift and videoreflective dacryomeniscometry are introduced; some of these should prove useful clinically. Quality of life in affected preoperative and postoperative cohorts is then assessed. Original publications have been achieved in all but one of the following subsections. Conjunctivochalasis in watery eye patients has been examined for the first time in a sizeable study clinically and histopathologically. The lateral tarsal strip procedure has been described as a new method of dealing with the punctal apposition syndrome. A new assessment for success in dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) surgery, the Valsalva bubble test, has been carried out. Tear osmolality has been studied in watery eye cohorts and compared with normal controls; this study suggests that tear production decreases significantly with obstructed lacrimal outflow. Videoreflective dacryomeniscometry has shown that watery eye patients have a higher tear meniscus than normal controls, and that this normalises following DCR surgery. Lower eyelid tensometry has been shown in patients to be unchanged compared with normal controls. Computerised tomography of the lacrimal drainage region has been used to study patients with nasolacrimal duct obstruction. The detailed clinical mechanics of syringing the canaliculus have been described. Transcaruncular medial orbitotomy surgery for laxity of the medial canthal tendon has been tested in human cadavers, and evaluated in adult living humans. In summary, this thesis may be regarded as a tentative approach to a re-evaluation of the clinical management of the watery eye.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tears.</field><field name="subject">Eye -- Abnormalities.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lessons in history in the high court's approach to native title in Australia</field><field name="creator">Dominello, Francesca Giorgia , Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">The High Court decision in Mabo v Queensland (No 2) was interpreted by some as bringing to an end a history of discrimination and dispossession of indigenous peoples' lands. In this respect it was located within the new history movement in Australia - a movement which has raised awareness of the impact that colonisation has had on indigenous peoples in Australia. ln this thesis the extent to which Mabo was in fact a product of the new history movement in Australia is examined. An analysis of the results in the more recent High Court cases on native title such as Western Australia v Ward and Members of the Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria reveals that the promises that came with native title recognition in Mabo have not been fulfilled. ln Ward the native title claim was partially accepted; in Yorta Yorta lhe claim was completely rejected. But as the analysis further reveals the shortcomings of the native title regime as demonstrated by these cases can be partly located in the Mabo decision itself. One of the contributions that some new historians have made to the writing of Australian history has been to reveal how the perceived differences between indigenous peoples and the colonists resulted in the perception of indigenous peoples as inferior beings. In turn, such perceptions worked to legitimise their dispossession in the native title context, indigenous peoples are no longer to be perceived as inferior (the rejection of the terra nullius doctrine in Mabo was an acknowledgement that indigenous peoples did have their own laws and social organisation) However the perception that they are different remains in the way that laws for them are constructed: native title may be recognised by the common law, but it is not part of the common law. As it is argued in this thesis the perceived differences in the origins of native title and the Australian common law has resulted in the inferior r treatment of native title. Potential solutions are canvassed in the thesis. Included among them is the need to give recognition to Aboriginal sovereignty However, it is concluded that if any change is to take place it must involve changing perceptions of indigenous peoples so that the protection of their interests may be more broadly construed as being in the interests of Australia.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Native title (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Mabo decision.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35385</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ADAPT : architectural and design exploration for application specific instruction-set processor technologies</field><field name="creator">Shee, Seng Lin, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents design automation methodologies for extensible processor platforms in application specific domains. The work presents first a single processor approach for customization; a methodology that can rapidly create different processor configurations by the removal of unused instructions sets from the architecture. A profile directed approach is used to identify frequently used instructions and to eliminate unused opcodes from the available instruction pool.  A coprocessor approach is next explored to create an SoC (System-on-Chip) to speedup the application while reducing energy consumption. Loops in applications are identified and accelerated by tightly coupling a coprocessor to an ASIP (Application Specific Instruction-set Processor). Latency hiding is used to exploit the parallelism provided by this architecture. A case study has been performed on a JPEG encoding algorithm; comparing two different coprocessor approaches: a high-level synthesis approach and our custom coprocessor approach.  The thesis concludes by introducing a heterogenous multi-processor system using ASIPs as processing entities in a pipeline configuration. The problem of mapping each algorithmic stage in the system to an ASIP configuration is formulated. We proposed an estimation technique to calculate runtimes of the configured multiprocessor system without running cycle-accurate simulations, which could take a significant amount of time. We present two heuristics to efficiently search the design space of a pipeline-based multi ASIP system and compare the results against an exhaustive approach.  In our first approach, we show that, on average, processor size can be reduced by 30%, energy consumption by 24%, while performance is improved by 24%. In the coprocessor approach, compared with the use of a main processor alone, a loop performance improvement of 2.57x is achieved using the custom coprocessor approach, as against 1.58x for the high level synthesis method, and 1.33x for the customized instruction approach. Energy savings are 57%, 28% and 19%, respectively. Our multiprocessor design provides a performance improvement of at least 4.03x for JPEG and 3.31x for MP3, for a single processor design system. The minimum cost obtained using our heuristic was within 0.43% and 0.29% of the optimum values for the JPEG and MP3 benchmarks respectively.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hardware/software co-design.</field><field name="subject">Embedded systems.</field><field name="subject">Estimation.</field><field name="subject">Partitioning.</field><field name="subject">Performance optimization.</field><field name="subject">Pipelining.</field><field name="subject">System-on-chip.</field><field name="subject">Multiprocessors -- Design and construction.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of nuclear factor-kappa B in beta-cell survival and function</field><field name="creator">Liuwantara, David , Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">In Type 1 diabetes, beta-cells is subjected to an autoimmune-mediated apoptotic and inflammatory attack. Whilst lymphocytes are the primary contributor of beta-cell death, exposure of beta-cells to stress signals such as cytokines, transform these cells into an inflammatory state activating transcripts for toxic agents. Demonstrating a significant role for beta-cells in participating in their own destruction through the elaboration of toxins and chemotactic molecules that could contribute to increased cellular infiltration. The Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-kB) is a transcription factor that provides for early immediate stress responses governing inflammation and cell survival. In islets, NF-kB is thought to have an important role in beta-cell inflammation and apoptosis. Few studies however, have explored the role of NF-kB in beta-cell protection. Indeed, we found that the expression NF-kB is responsible for the islet-intrinsic immediate-early pro-inflammatory gene expression. Importantly however, we also found that in islets, NF-kB is responsible for the expression and regulation of anti-apoptotic genes. We demonstrated for the first time that similar to other cells, the expression and regulation of the anti-inflammatory/ anti-apoptotic gene A20, in islets, is regulated by NF-kB. Consequently, we found a somewhat paradoxical role for NF-kB, where on the one hand it is responsible for beta-cell death, whilst on the other hand it is also responsible for beta-cell survival. In vivo however, we found that islet survival and function was severely impaired in the absence of NF-kB activity. We observed that blockade of NF-kB abrogate cytokine-induced A20 expression, and inhibited the activation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro. In contrast, blockade of NF-kB by over-expression of A20 resulted in an improved islet allograft survival with good metabolic control. Thus demonstrating the importance of NF-kB-dependent anti-apoptotic genes for islet survival and function. The findings presented in this thesis demonstrate a fundamental bimodal role for NF-kB in maintaining the balance of survival of beta-cells in the context of T1D. These data, uncovers a sophisticated molecular mechanism in the regulation of beta-cell death, survival, and metabolic function. Thus providing a better understanding of the role of NF-kB in beta-cells in the context of T1D.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Apoptosis.</field><field name="subject">Transcription factors.</field><field name="subject">B cells.</field><field name="subject">Diabetes.</field><field name="subject">Gene expression.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/36881</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On small time asymptotics of solutions of stochastic equations in infinite dimensions</field><field name="creator">Jegaraj, Terence Joseph, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the small time asymptotics of solutions of stochastic equations in infinite dimensions. In this abstract H denotes a separable Hilbert space, A denotes a linear operator on H generating a strongly continuous semigroup and (W(t))t???0 denotes a separable Hilbert space-valued Wiener process. In chapter 2 we consider the mild solution (Xx(t))t???[0,1] of a stochastic initial value problem dX = AX dt + dW t ??? (0, 1] X(0) = x ??? H , where the equation has an invariant measure ??. Under some conditions L(Xx(t)) has a density k(t, x, ??) with respect to ?? and we can find the limit limt???0 t ln k(t, x, y). For infinite dimensional H this limit only provides the lower bound of a large deviation principle (LDP) for the family of continuous trajectory-valued random variables { t ??? [0, 1] ??? Xx(??t) : ?? ??? (0, 1]}. In each of chapters 3, 4 and 5 we find an LDP which describes the small time asymptotics of the continuous trajectories of the solution of a stochastic initial value problem. A crucial role is played by the LDP associated with the Gaussian trajectory-valued random variable of the noise. Chapter 3 considers the initial value problem dX(t) = (AX(t) + F(t,X(t))) dt + G(X(t)) dW(t) t ??? (0, 1] X(0) = x ??? H, where drift function F(t, ??) is Lipschitz continuous on H uniformly in t ??? [0, 1] and diffusion function G is Lipschitz continuous, taking values that are Hilbert-Schmidt operators. Chapter 4 considers an equation with dissipative drift function F defined on a separable Banach space continuously embedded in H; the solution has continuous trajectories in the Banach space. Chapter 5 considers a linear initial value problem with fractional Brownian motion noise. In chapter 6 we return to equations with Wiener process noise and find a lower bound for liminft???0 t ln P{X(0) ??? B,X(t) ??? C} for arbitrary L(X(0)) and Borel subsets B and C of H. We also obtain an upper bound for limsupt???0 t ln P{X(0) ??? B,X(t) ???

Vehicle tracking is used in Intelligent Transport System (ITS) and surveillance systems. Its re- liability is critical to the overall performance of these systems. Feature-based methods that are used to represent distinctive content in visual frames are one approach to vehicle tracking. Existing feature-based tracking systems can only track vehicles under ideal conditions. They have difficulties when used under a variety of conditions, for example, during both the day and night. They are highly dependent on stable local features that can be tracked for a long time period. These local features are easily lost because of their local property and image noise caused by factors such as, headlight reflections and sun glare. This thesis presents a new approach, addressing the reliability issues mentioned above, tracking whole feature groups composed of feature points extracted with the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm. A feature group in- cludes several features that share a similar property over a time period and can be tracked to the next frame by tracking individual feature points inside it. It is lost only when all of the features in it are lost in the next frame. We cre- ate these feature groups by clustering individual feature points using distance, velocity and acceleration information between two consecutive frames. These feature groups are then hierarchically clustered by their inter-group distance, velocity and acceleration information. Experimental results show that the pro- posed vehicle tracking system can track vehicles with the average accuracy of over 95%, even when the vehicles have complex motions in noisy scenes. It gen- erally works well even in difficult environments, such as for rainy days, windy days, and at night. We are surprised to find that our tracking system locates and tracks motor bikes and pedestrians. This could open up wider opportunities and further investigation and experiments are required to confirm the tracking performance for these objects. Further work is also required to track more com- plex motions, such as rotation and articulated objects with different motions on different parts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grouping</field><field name="subject">Vehicle Tracking</field><field name="subject">Local Features</field><field name="subject">Space vehicle -- Tracking</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selection and isolation of high producing mammalian clones</field><field name="creator">Shu, Cindy Chia-Fan, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research studied recombinant DNA-derived protein expression utilising expression vectors containing IRES sequences to link the gene of interest with the gene encoding selectable marker in mammalian cell cultures. Polycistronic expression constructs utilising internal ribosome entry site (IRES) can link unrelated genes under control of a single promoter. Transient study on the IRESlinked gene expression was performed. It was possible to standardise the level of protein expression to plasmid number by determining the number of free plasmids in the cytoplasm. The expression of a selectable marker when downstream of IRES was reduced in comparison to the monocistronic construct. Importantly when IRES was used, there were no negative effects on recombinant gene expression upstream of IRES. Down-regulating the selectable marker gene expression has been shown to enhance the probability of obtaining highly expressing clones. To investigate the effects of down-regulating fusion metallothionein green fluorescent protein (MTGFP), new constructs were created to combine metal inducible M2.6 promoter to drive the expression of human growth hormone linked to MTGFP by an attenuated IRES. This resulted in less MTGFP expression, reduced survivability and mean fluorescence in the presence of heavy metal. The increased metal sensitivity lengthened the initial selection period using reduced metal concentration in comparison to cells transfected with wildtype MTGFP. FACS can be used to select for resistance conferred by MTGFP despite reduced expression. FACS enrichment and sorting increased the hGH expression, which was correlated with mean fluorescence of the population; therefore fluorescence can be used as an indication of the final recombinant protein expression. Different approaches to isolate suitable clones were also investigated. It is preferable to select the transfected pool in low metal concentration for two weeks, sort for cells of high-fluorescence, and allow for recovery and proliferation. It is then possible to amplify gene expression by culturing the clones in increasing metal, resulting in further improvement of recombinant protein expression.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Green fluorescent protein.</field><field name="subject">Metallothionein.</field><field name="subject">Flow cytometry.</field><field name="subject">Clones (Plants) -- Selection.</field><field name="subject">Gene expression.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the characterisation, procoagulant activity and Annexin V binding properties of platelet-derived microparticles.</field><field name="creator">Connor, David Ewan, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Platelet-derived microparticles, released as a result of platelet activation, promote coagulation through the surface exposure of phosphatidylserine, acting as the catalytic site for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin by the activated coagulation factors X and V. Although elevated numbers of circulating platelet-derived microparticles can be detected in a number of clinical disorders, the methods for the detection of these microparticles are far from standardised. In addition, recent reports have also speculated that not all microparticles may expose phosphatidylserine, demonstrating that the binding of Annexin V, a phosphatidylserine-specific binding protein, is not detectable on a population of microparticles. The initial stage of this thesis was to establish a flow cytometric method for the detection and enumeration of microparticles based on their capacity to bind Annexin V and to utilise this assay to investigate a number of the issues that have limited assay standardisation. The assay could be performed on either stimulated or unstimulated plasma or whole blood samples. Interestingly, plasma microparticle counts were significantly higher than whole blood microparticle counts. The effects of centrifugation alone could not be attributed as the sole source of this discrepancy. The antigenic characteristics of platelet-derived microparticles were also investigated, with platelet-derived microparticles demonstrated to express the platelet glycoproteins CD31, CD41a, CD42a and CD61. Platelet-derived microparticles also expressed CD42b, and this expression was significantly decreased when compared to their progenitor platelets. The expression of the platelet activation markers CD62p, CD63, CD40L and PAC-1 was dependent upon the sample milieu, suggesting that the centrifugation conditions required to generate platelet-poor plasma may lead to artefactual increases in the expression of platelet activation markers. An investigation of the role of the GpIIb/IIIa complex on the formation of platelet-derived microparticles was also performed. A monoclonal antibody to the GpIIb/IIIa complex (Abciximab) significantly inhibited in vitro collagen-stimulated platelet-derived microparticle formation. Interestingly, platelets obtained from two subjects with impaired GpIIb/IIIa activation, demonstrated normal microparticle formation following collagen stimulation, suggesting that the presence of GpIIb/IIIa complex, but not its activation, is required for collagen-induced microparticle formation. A novel mechanism for microparticle formation was also investigated, with platelet-derived microparticles demonstrated to form in response to the sclerosing agents sodium-tetradecyl sulphate and polidocanol. Interestingly, the removal of plasma proteins by the washing of platelets left platelets more susceptible to sclerosant-induced microparticle formation, suggesting that plasma proteins may protect platelets from microparticle formation. The procoagulant activity of platelet-derived microparticles was also investigated using a novel coagulation assay (XACT) specific for the procoagulant phospholipid. An evaluation of this assay demonstrated a significant correlation between Annexin V binding microparticle counts and procoagulant activity in both whole blood and plasma samples. There was more procoagulant activity in whole blood samples than in plasma samples, suggesting that the procoagulant phospholipid activity was also associated with erythrocytes or leukocytes. To further investigate this phenomenon, a whole blood flow cytometric assay was developed to assess Annexin V binding to erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets and microparticles. This assay demonstrated that a large proportion of Annexin V binding (51.0%) was associated with erythrocytes. Interestingly, a proportion of the Annexin V binding erythrocytes (24.5%) and leukocytes (78.8%) were also associated with platelet CD61 antigen, suggesting that they also bound a platelet or platelet-derived microparticle. The effect of sample anticoagulant on microparticle procoagulant activity was investigated. Microparticle counts were most stable in EDTA anticoagulated samples, but were stable in sodium citrate for up to 15 minutes following sample collection. The procoagulant activity of microparticles was significantly inhibited by EDTA in collagen-stimulated platelet-rich plasma samples, when compared to sodium citrate anticoagulated samples. Although the initial method used to investigate microparticles was based upon their ability to bind Annexin V, it was consistently observed that a large proportion of events in the size region of a microparticle were Annexin V negative. An investigation was therefore commenced into the procoagulant activity of microparticles based on their capacity to bind Annexin V. The presence of Annexin V negative microparticles was confirmed by flow cytometry and the proportion of microparticles that bound Annexin V was dependent upon type of agonist used to stimulate microparticle formation. Varying the assay constituents (calcium concentration / Annexin V concentration / buffer type) did not alter the proportion of Annexin V binding microparticles. When compared to Annexin V positive microparticles, Annexin V negative microparticles expressed significantly higher levels of CD42b on their surface, but possessed significantly decreased expressions of CD62p, and CD63. A significant correlation between the percentage of Annexin V binding and XACT procoagulant activity was found (p=0.03). Furthermore, Annexin V binding inhibited greater than 98% of procoagulant phospholipid activity, suggesting that Annexin V binding was a true reflection of procoagulant activity. Microparticles could be sorted using either a flow cytometric or magnetic sorting strategy. By electron microscopy, Annexin V negative events isolated following magnetic sorting were vesicular structures and not small platelets or the remnants of activated platelets. In summary, this thesis has demonstrated the ability of the flow cytometer and XACT assays to detect microparticles and their procoagulant activity. It has also shown that the use of Annexin V to detect microparticles may warrant further investigation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phosphatidylserine.</field><field name="subject">Platelet.</field><field name="subject">Microparticle.</field><field name="subject">Procoagulant phospholipid.</field><field name="subject">XACT.</field><field name="subject">Platelet-derived growth factor.</field><field name="subject">Plasma.</field><field name="subject">Platelet activating factor.</field><field name="subject">Lipocortins.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new bidirectional AC-DC converter using matrix converter and Z-source converter topologies</field><field name="creator">You, Keping , Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes a new bidirectional three-phase AC-DC power converter using matrix converter and Z-source inverter topologies. Advantages of the AC-DC matrix converter are the inherently controllable power factor, the tight DC voltage regulation, the wide bandwidth with quick response to load variation, the single-stage buck-voltage AC-to-DC power conversion; advantages of the z-source inverter are the increased reliability by allowing the shoot-through between upper and lower power switches of one inverter leg, insensitivity to DC bus voltage due to the extra freedom of controlling DC-link voltage.  The proposed Matrix-Z-source converter (MZC) marries up both advantages of AC-DC matrix converter and Z-source inverter. It can achieve voltage-boost DC-AC inversion capable of variable voltage variable frequency (VVVF) AC output; it can achieve voltage-buck AC-DC rectification capable of inherent control over AC current phase angle and DC output regulation with a (VVVF) AC source supply. Both foresaid performance in DC-AC inversion and AC-DC rectification can be implemented in a simple open-loop control manner. Three constraints of VSI, in the bidirectional AC-DC power conversion, are the peak AC voltages are always less than DC-link voltage, closed-loop control has to be employed when DC regulation and/or AC current phase angle control are required, and AC voltage is sensitive to the variation of the DC-link voltage in DC-AC inversion. The voltage-boost inversion and/or voltage-buck rectification of MZC overcomes the first constraint; thus MZC enables the AC machine voltage increased higher than DC-link voltage hence advantages of running AC machine at relatively high voltages are enabled. The direct DC voltage regulation and inherent AC-current-phase-angle control of MZC overcomes the second constraint in an open-loop manner; hence a simplified system design is obtained with sufficient room for the further improvement by closed-loop control schemes. The extra freedom in controlling DC-link voltage of MZC overcomes the third constraint hence a DC source voltage adaptable inverter is obtained. This thesis focuses on the study of the feasibility of the proposed MZC through theoretical analysis and experimental verification. At first, the proposed MZC is conceptually constructed by examining the quadrant operation of AC-DC matrix converter and Z-source inverter. After the examination of the operating principles of both AC-DC matrix converter and Z-source inverter, the configuration of MZC is then proposed. The MZC has two operating modes: DC-AC inversion and AC-DC rectification. Circuit analysis for both operating modes shows that the new topology does not impose critical conflict in circuit design or extra restriction in parameterization. On the contrary, one version of the proposed MZC can make full advantage of Z-source network components in both operating modes, i.e. a pair of Z-source inductor and capacitor can be used as low-pass filter in AC-DC rectification. The modulation strategy, average modeling of system, and features of critical variables for circuit design of the proposed MZC were examined for each operating mode. Simulations of the proposed MZC and its experimental verification have been presented. Analytical models of conduction and switching losses of the power-switch network in different operating mode have shown that the losses in the MZC compare favorably with conventional VSI for a range of power factor and modulation indices.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Z-source converter.</field><field name="subject">Bidirectional AC-DC converter.</field><field name="subject">Matrix converter.</field><field name="subject">Matrix Z-source converter.</field><field name="subject">Losses analysis of Z-source converter.</field><field name="subject">Loss analysis of AC-DC  matrix converter.</field><field name="subject">DC-AC voltage boost inversion.</field><field name="subject">AC-DC voltage buck generation.</field><field name="subject">Topology.</field><field name="subject">Electric current converters.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Undoing theatre: forced entertainment and 'the formless'</field><field name="creator">Williams, David Anthony, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the theatre of Sheffield-based theatre group Forced Entertainment in terms of what art historian Robert Hewison terms 'Social Surrealism'. This term describes a politically engaged series of art practices that developed in Britain under Margaret Thatcher in the late nineteen-eighties. 'Social Surrealist' theatre makers adopted a radically different set of aesthetic strategies to the more traditional leftist political theatre tradition of 'social realism'. While Hewison links these practices to the so-called 'classical' Surrealism theorised by Andr?? Breton, I will argue that a more appropriate and useful Surrealist lineage to account for Forced Entertainment's theatre can be found in the writings of Andr?? Breton's main Surrealist rival, Georges Bataille. This thesis focuses on Bataille's notion of 'the formless' or formlessness, that which undoes and unravels the security and fixity of form, and uses this as a theoretical concept to account for the aesthetics and unravelling theatre practice of Forced Entertainment. This thesis then examines a selection of theatre works by Forced Entertainment, tracing the ways in which these works undo theatre using formlessness.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Theater.</field><field name="subject">Forced Entertainment (Theater group)</field><field name="subject">Georges Bataille.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reinforcement learning by incremental patching</field><field name="creator">Kim, Min Sub, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates how an autonomous reinforcement learning agent can improve on an approximate solution by augmenting it with a small patch, which overrides the approximate solution at certain states of the problem. In reinforcement learning, many approximate solutions are smaller and easier to produce than ???flat??? solutions that maintain distinct parameters for each fully enumerated state, but the best solution within the constraints of the approximation may fall well short of global optimality. This thesis proposes that the remaining gap to global optimality can be efficiently minimised by learning a small patch over the approximate solution.  In order to improve the agent???s behaviour, algorithms are presented for learning the overriding patch. The patch is grown around particular regions of the problem where the approximate solution is found to be deficient. Two heuristic strategies are proposed for concentrating resources to those areas where inaccuracies in the approximate solution are most costly, drawing a compromise between solution quality and storage requirements. Patching also handles problems with continuous state variables, by two alternative methods: Kuhn triangulation over a fixed discretisation and nearest neighbour interpolation with a variable discretisation.  As well as improving the agent???s behaviour, patching is also applied to the agent???s model of the environment. Inaccuracies in the agent???s model of the world are detected by statistical testing, using a selective sampling strategy to limit storage requirements for collecting data.  The patching algorithms are demonstrated in several problem domains, illustrating the effectiveness of patching under a wide range of conditions. A scenario drawn from a real-time strategy game demonstrates the ability of patching to handle large complex tasks.  These contributions combine to form a general framework for patching over approximate solutions in reinforcement learning. Complex problems cannot be solved by brute force alone, and some form of approximation is necessary to handle large problems. However, this does not mean that the limitations of approximate solutions must be accepted without question. Patching demonstrates one way in which an agent can leverage approximation techniques without losing the ability to handle fine yet important details.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reinforcement learning.</field><field name="subject">Markov decision processes.</field><field name="subject">Patchwork.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phenotypic and functional changes in cord blood stem cell progeny after cytokine activation</field><field name="creator">Ramirez, Carole , Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Human umbilical cord blood, an alternate source of haematopoietic stem cells (HSC), has been successfully used to reconstitute haematopoiesis in both related and unrelated transplant recipients. However, because CB has fewer total cells (and as a consequence fewer HSC and progenitor cells) CB transplant recipients often experience delayed engraftment as compared with that seen in bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood transplant recipients. Delayed engraftment exposes patients to an increased risk of infection and bleeding. Cytokine-mediated expansion has been investigated to improve engraftment after CB HSC transplantation as a means to expand the total cell number and both the HSC and progenitors populations. However, its effect on HSC function remains controversial. We hypothesise that if cytokine-mediated expansion promotes divisional recruitment and multilineage differentiation it causes changes in phenotype and cell cycle related gene expression which may be detrimental to the engraftment capacity of haematopoietic cells. Therefore we investigated the relationship between cell division, phenotype and engraftment potential of CB CD34+ cells following cytokine-mediated expansion. High resolution cell division tracking using the fluorescent dye CFSE was used to monitor changes as a consequence of cytokine-mediated expansion in phenotype and function in CB CD34+ cells. Cytokine-mediated expansion caused upregulation of lineage and proliferation markers and adhesion molecules and downregulation of putative stem cell markers with concomitant cell division. However, these changes in phenotype as a consequence of cytokine-mediated expansion may not reflect or be predictive of a functional change in the expanded population. Cytokine-mediated expansion of CB CD34+ also caused changes in cell cycle related gene expression of G1 phase regulators. CB CD34+ cells exhibited expression of all D cyclins, albeit at different levels and p21WAF1 was differentially expressed across CB samples. The effect of cell division on the engraftment potential as a consequence of cytokine-mediated expansion was examined in CB CD34+. Cytokine-mediated expansion of CB CD34+ cells reduced, but did not completely eliminate engraftment potential, as a proportion of the expanded and divided cell populations retained their ability to engraft the NOD-SCID mouse. Overall, this study confirms reports in the literature that cytokine-mediated expansion induces changes in the phenotype of HSC and compromises their in vivo function.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stem cells.</field><field name="subject">Cord blood.</field><field name="subject">Ex vivo expansion.</field><field name="subject">Cytokines.</field><field name="subject">Activation (Chemistry)</field><field name="subject">Phenotype.</field><field name="subject">Haemopoiesis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39798</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Should the rule in Houldsworth??s case be abrogated by statute?</field><field name="creator">Di Lernia, Cary Anthony, Business Law &amp; Taxation, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">At the crossroads of insolvency and securities law lies the question as to whether defrauded shareholders should rank equally with unsecured creditors in cases involving fraudulent or misleading behaviour. Important questions arise at this juncture concerning the efficiency, certainty, transparency and fairness of the treatment of such claims in insolvency situations. In Sons of Gwalia Ltd (admin apptd) v Margaretic [2007] HCA 1, the High Court chose not to apply a rule said to be germane to insolvency cases involving fraudulent or misleading conduct inducing share purchase known as the rule in Houldsworth??s Case. The ??rule?? said to have been developed in Houldsworth v City of Glasgow Bank (1880) 5 App Cas 317 had up until the High Court??s decision been used to interpret legislative provisions concerning shareholder claims, resulting in problematic determinations in the context of modern developed markets.  While it is submitted the High Court was justified in choosing not to apply the rule in Houldsworth??s Case and thus allowing shareholders to claim as unsecured creditors, the rule may still prove good law in certain cases. Indeed, the referral of the High Court??s decision to the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee for review may result in legislative change which reverts to the traditional treatment of shareholders in such circumstances. Accordingly this dissertation engages in a doctrinal analysis of historical precedent on defrauded shareholder claims in the UK and Australia to demonstrate that the decision in Houldsworth and subsequent interpretation and application of the ??rule?? therein suffer from deep flaws, and have been productive of relative injustice. It is argued that it is necessary to put the current uncertainty surrounding the applicability of Houldsworth in Australia beyond doubt through legislative abrogation of the rule in Houldsworth??s Case. As the result of such abrogation would represent a significant policy shift in Australian corporate law, the merits and difficulties of the resulting position will be addressed by this dissertation. It will be argued that a policy of shareholder parity with unsecured creditors best meets the goals of insolvency and securities law regimes while contributing to the sustainability of a fair and efficient market, and investor participation in it.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aggrieved shareholder rights</field><field name="subject">Houldsworth's case</field><field name="subject">Sons of Gwalia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breath biomarkers associated with lung cancer</field><field name="creator">Tran , Vanessa Hoang, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Lung cancer (LC) is often diagnosed at advanced stage and as a result, survival rates are low. Recent studies describe exhaled breath and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) as a potential non-invasive method of sampling the airways for assessing inflammation of the respiratory system, and possibly for the early detection of LC. It was hypothesised that higher concentrations of markers and protein will be present in the EBC of LC patients compared to those of normal controls and healthy smokers, and may aid in assessing lung status.  Methods: The gaseous phase of breath was investigated for volatile organic compound (VOC) patterns using an electronic nose (eNose) system, in addition to off-line measurements of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO) levels. The aqueous phase, EBC, was collected during tidal breathing through a glass collection device cooled to 4??C by ice. Nitrite/nitrate (NOx) and pH levels were determined by a fluorescent modification of the Griess method, and silicon chip sensor pH meter, respectively. Protein levels in EBC were examined with a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, silver staining and PAGE techniques, while the levels of tumour markers, CYFRA 21-1 and CEA, were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).  Results: The eNose machine was not able to produce characteristic VOC profiles from exhaled breath unique to each study group, while no significant difference was observed for mean NOx concentrations in the LC group when compared to other subjects (p=0.8824). Higher protein levels were found in the EBC of LC patient compared to normal controls (p=0.0204), with subsequent measurements of elevated CEA levels observed in the LC group when compared to non-smokers and smokers (p=0.023).  Conclusion: This study showed that protein can be detected in the exhaled breath condensate of patients, with a significantly elevated amount in the samples from newly diagnosed LC patients. The mechanism for these differences remains to be determined but may be related to inflammatory changes within the airway, such as vascular protein leakage and release of mediators. Future work may aim to identify the upregulated proteins, and focus on proteomics and tissue microarrays to explore candidate proteins.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electronic nose.</field><field name="subject">Lung cancer.</field><field name="subject">Exhaled breath condensate</field><field name="subject">Protein.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the atypical dual specificity phosphatase DUSP26</field><field name="creator">Patterson, Kate Isabel, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">In many ways cancer is a disease of cellular signalling disequilibrium. When the equilibrium of key signalling pathways is upset, critical biological functions such as cell growth, survival, motility, proliferation, metabolism and apoptosis are affected, and can lead to the initiation of cancer. Reversible protein phosphorylation is an extremely important mechanism by which the activity of enzymes and proteins in signalling cascades can be regulated. Dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) are a unique subgroup of the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in that they can dephosphorylate both phospho-tyrosine and phospho-serine/threonine residues within the one substrate.  Many DUSPs have been implicated in cancer as critical regulators of key cancer- associated signalling cascades including the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.  Transcript profiling of 51 primary ovarian tumours and four normal ovaries as controls identified an uncharacterised atypical DUSP, DUSP26 as being potentially down-regulated in all histological subtypes of ovarian cancer compared with normal ovaries. DUSP26 is located at 8p12, a chromosomal region previously shown to exhibit allelic imbalance in ovarian cancer. DUSP26 is predominantly expressed in neuro-endocrine tissue, with high expression also in skeletal muscle, prostate and ovary. DUSP26 mRNA expression is reduced in brain cancer, neuroblastoma, and ovarian cancer cell lines compared to normal, consistent with a role for DUSP26 as a tumour suppressor gene. Furthermore, DUSP26 can negatively affect the proliferation of epithelial cells, also consistent with a role as a tumour suppressor gene.  Expression of DUSP26 in primary ovarian cancer samples is variable however, and analysis of DUSP26 protein expression is required to reconcile these results. Preliminary results suggest that DUSP26 is epigenetically regulated and that hypermethylation may contribute to its silencing in cancer. In the literature, there is great controversy in regards to the substrate specificity of DUSP26. Results presented in this thesis conclusively demonstrate that DUSP26 is not a MAPK phosphatase, despite reports to the contrary. Instead, using a substrate trapping approach, two novel potential DUSP26 substrates were identified: DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA), which are often dysregulated in cancer. Consequently, DUSP26 may affect the pathogenesis of cancer via DNA-PK and or NuMA.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">DUSP</field><field name="subject">Phosphatase</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43594</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trends and development of non-communicable diseases and risk factors in Samoa over 24 years</field><field name="creator">Viali, Satupaitea, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Abstract inserted as part of Final MPH Thesis:  Non-Communicable Diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers and others, have become the major cause of premature death, morbidity and disability in many Pacific countries including Samoa. These are linked by common preventable risk factors like obesity, hypertension, smoking, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity. OBJECTIVES: To determine the trends and development of Non-Communicable diseases and its risk factors in Samoa over the last 24 years using the recently developed diagnostic criteria. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This research thesis combines 3 large surveys that were done in 1978, 1991, and 2002, looking at the trends in the prevalence of diabetes, and the prevalence of the NCD risk factors such as blood pressure, obesity, cholesterol and smoking. The 3 survey samples were selected randomly from around similar regions (Urban Upolu, Rural Upolu, and Rural Savaii) of Samoa in 1978, 1991 and 2002, with a total of 5973 individuals (1978 survey = 1467; 1991 survey = 1778; 2002 survey = 2728) available for the thesis analysis. The 1978 and 1991 data sets were secured from Professor P Zimmet, and the 2002 STEPs survey data set was secured from the Samoa Ministry of Health. The 3 surveys methodologies, survey procedures, questionnaires and anthropometric measurements were similar though the diagnostic criteria used to measure obesity slightly differ between the surveys. The blood pressure measurements were similar though the diastolic blood pressure measure in 1978 was higher. The 1978 and 1991 surveys used fasting venous blood sampling to measure fasting plasma glucose, and cholesterol levels at the laboratory. OGTT was also used in 1978 and 1991, but not 2002. The 2002 survey used capillary sampling to measure fasting glucose using a glucometer, and cholesterol level using a cholesterol meter. The combined data was then cleaned, standardized and matched with each survey, to make analysis easier. The recent diagnostic criteria were then applied to all the surveys to diagnose diabetes (1999 WHO Diabetes Criteria), hypertension (WHO 1999, JNC-VII 2003, NHF 1999 Hypertension Criteria), obesity (BMI &#8805;30 kg/m??), and hypercholesterolaemia. The prevalences using the recent diagnostic criteria were then mapped out.  RESULTS: The overall age-standardized prevalence of type 2 diabetes (known or previously unknown) utilizing the current 1999 WHO diagnostic criteria for men and women &#8805;20 years of age has increased from 5.4% (males 4.8%, females 5.9%) in 1978, to 12.0% (males 10.9%, females 13.5%) in 1991, and to 20.1% (males 17.2%, females 22.2%) in 2002. Among the individuals with diabetes in the 3 surveys, more than 60% had previously undiagnosed diabetes. Compared with the 1978 survey, the diabetes prevalence in 2002 represents a 4-fold increase over the 24 year period. This has occurred along with increasing obesity, urbanization and modernization, aging, cultural changes, and changes in physical activity. There is a high prevalence of non-communicable disease risk factors. The age-standardized prevalence of hypertension defined by the WHO 1999 and JNC-VII 2003 criteria was 47.2% in 1978, 22.5% in 1991, and 24.0% in 2002. The high prevalence of hypertension in 1978 was due to the method used for recording diastolic blood pressure. Hypertension was more common in the urban regions than rural regions in 1978 and 1991 while in 2002, there was no statistical difference between the rates of hypertension between the different regions due to the rise in the prevalence rate of hypertension in rural regions.   There is a high prevalence of overweight and obesity in Samoa. Using the WHO classification for BMI, there was an increase in obesity (BMI &#8805; 30kg/m??) prevalence in Samoa in the last decade, increasing steeply from 34.9% in 1978 to 51.3% in 1991, and slowing down to an increase to 57.4% in 2002. The prevalence of obesity is significantly higher in females compared with their male counterparts. The overweight prevalence (BMI 25-29.9kg/m??) was 34% in 1978, 31% in 1991 and 29% in 2002. The prevalence of obesity has increased by 65% from 1978 to 2002 with an increase of 47% from 1978 to 1991, and 12% from 1991 to 2002. Prevalence of obesity is increasing with age and is more of a problem in women than men. It is higher in the urban regions but there has been a faster rise in obesity prevalence in rural regions from 1978 to 2002 as the rural regions become urbanized. The prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia (total cholesterol &#8805; 5.2 mmol/l) was 30.5% in 1978, and this increased to 51.1% in 1991. There was a marked decline of hypercholesterolaemia in 2002 (14.4%), which may be due to differences in the method of measurement. Although smoking prevalence remains high in Samoa it declined significantly from 42.4% 1978 to 35.3% 1991 but remained essentially steady at 38% in 2002. There was a significant gender difference in smoking with about 60% of men and 20% of women smoking regularly. CONCLUSION: Samoa is experiencing an increasing problem with Non-Communicable diseases like diabetes and some of its risk factors.  Diabetes prevalence has dramatically increased by 4-fold in the last 24 years. The prevalence of hypertension has stabilized around 23% though there was a decrease from 1978. The prevalence of obesity has also increased. Smoking prevalence has slightly increased from 1991 to 2002 with a significant number of the population smoking. Hypercholesterolaemia is more common in 1991 with an apparent decrease in 2002. These findings have important implications for public health efforts and policy developments to contain the epidemic of Non-Communicable diseases in Samoa.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Obesity</field><field name="subject">Non-Communicable Diseases</field><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representations of quivers over finite fields</field><field name="creator">Hua, Jiuzhao , Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this thesis is to obtain surprising identities by counting the representations of quivers over finite fields. A classical result states that the dimension vectors of the absolutely indecomposable representations of a quiver ?? are in one-to-one correspondence with the positive roots of a root system ??, which is infinite in general. For a given dimension vector ?? ??? ??+, the number A??(??, q), which counts the isomorphism classes of the absolutely indecomposable representations of ?? of dimension ?? over the finite field Fq, turns out to be a polynomial in q with integer coefficients, which have been conjectured to be nonnegative by Kac. The main result of this thesis is a multi-variable formal identity which expresses an infinite series as a formal product indexed by ??+ which has the coefficients of various polynomials A??(??, q) as exponents. This identity turns out to be a qanalogue of the remarkable Weyl-Macdonald-Kac denominator identity modulus a conjecture of Kac, which asserts that the multiplicity of ?? is equal to the constant term of A??(??, q). An equivalent form of this conjecture is established and a partial solution is obtained. A new proof of the integrality of A??(??, q) is given. Three Maple programs have been included which enable one to calculate the polynomials A??(??, q) for quivers with at most three nodes. All sample out-prints are consistence with Kac???s conjectures. Another result of this thesis is as follows. Let A be a finite dimensional algebra over a perfect field K, M be a finitely generated indecomposable module over A ???K ??K. Then there exists a unique indecomposable module M??? over A such that M is a direct summand of M??? ???K ??K, and there exists a positive integer s such that Ms = M ??? ?? ?? ?? ??? M (s copies) has a unique minimal field of definition which is isomorphic to the centre of End ??(M???) rad (End ??(M???)).

Searle's realist account of consciousness</field><field name="creator">Francini, Althea, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">In art and education, theorists dispute the concept of visuality, or how meaning occurs from what we see. This study examines two opposed and acrimoniously entrenched theoretical perspectives adopted internationally: visual culture and aesthetics. In visual culture, visual experience, including perception is mediated by background cultural discourses. On this approach, subjectivity is explained as conventional, the role of the senses in making meaning is strongly diminished or rejected and from this, accounting for visuality precludes indeterminate and intuitive aspects. Differently, aesthetic perspectives approach visual meaning as obtaining through direct perceptual and felt aspects of aesthetic experience. Here, subjectivity remains discrete from language and the role of cultural discourse in making meaning diminishes or is excluded. Each description is important to the explanation of visuality in art and education, but problematic.  To start, the study outlines the central explanatory commitments of both visual culture and aesthetics. The study identifies problems in each with their explanations of subjectivity or self. Both positions maintain from earlier explanations of cognition that separate theoretically and practically the senses, cognitive processes, and context. The study looks at approaches to mind and representation in accounts of visuality and provides some background from the cognitive sciences to understand the problem further. Contemporary explanation from science and philosophy is revising the separation. However, some approaches from science are reductive of mind and both aesthetics and visual culture theorists are understandably reluctant to adopt scientistic or behaviourist approaches for the explanation of visual arts practices.  The aim of the study is to provide a non-reductive realist account of visuality in visual arts and education. To accomplish this aim, the study employs philosopher John R. Searle's explanation of consciousness because it explores subjectivity as qualitative, unified, and intrinsically social in experience. By doing this, the study addresses a gap in the theoretical understanding of the two dominant approaches to visuality. The key to relations between subjectivity and the world in reasoning is the capacity for mental representation. From this capacity and the rational agency of a self, practical reasoning is central to the creation, understanding, and appreciation of art and imagery. This account of consciousness, its aspects, and how it works includes description of the Background, as capacities enabling the uptake and structuring of sociocultural influence in mind. Crucially, the study shows how the capacity for reasoned action can be represented without dualism or reduction to the explanatory constraints of behavioural or physical sciences, an important commitment in the arts and education.  In this explanation, the study identifies epistemic constraints on the representation of mental states, including unconscious states, in accounting for practices as reasoned activities. Centrally, the study looks at how, from the capacities of consciousness and the self's freedom of will, visuality is unified as qualitative, cognitive, and social. In exploring Searle's explanation of consciousness, some account of current work on cognition extends discussion of a reconciliation of visuality on these terms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognition</field><field name="subject">Aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Visual culture</field><field name="subject">Subjectivity</field><field name="subject">Representation</field><field name="subject">Consciousness</field><field name="subject">Social mind</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43669</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pathology of the camera: tracing the path from collaboration to cooperation between camera and performer</field><field name="creator">Beaubois, Denis, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This paper investigates a series of video pieces that explore the pathology of the camera and the act of recording.

These cycles have been observed to respond to phase shifts in the El Ni??o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). To investigate wave and climate controls of embayment variability in finer detail, this study combines historical surveys with 45 years of wave data from the ERA-40 reanalysis and four years of high-resolution beach measurements using RTK-GPS and image-derived survey techniques. ENSO and Southern Annular Mode (SAM) controls of wave variability in the Sydney region are first explored. In general, wave heights increase/decrease and wave directions become more easterly/southerly during La Ni??a/El Ni??o phases. A positive correlation is observed between the SAM and summer wave heights, and a negative correlation between the SAM and winter wave directions. Storm variability is observed to be modified by the ENSO, but not the SAM. In particular, La Ni??a phases are generally associated with longer duration, higher energy events from a more easterly direction when compared to those during El Ni??o phases.  Wave controls of embayment variability are subsequently investigated. In the short-term (days - months), beach oscillation/rotation is observed to be the most dominant process, accounting for approx. 60%/20% of overall embayment variability. Beach oscillation is related to changes in wave height and storms, whereas beach rotation is related to changes in wave direction and/or wave period. An empirical model that estimates the beach response to individual storm events is developed. In the longer-term (months - years), beach rotation is observed to respond to both wave heights and directions. Larger waves are sheltered somewhat at the southern end, creating an apparent clockwise rotation under energetic wave conditions. Clockwise/anticlockwise rotations are also observed to follow southerly/easterly wave shifts at lags of up to 12 months. Comparisons between the ENSO and beach oscillation/rotation agree with previous observations that El Ni??o/La Ni??a phases are associated with an overall accretion/erosion and clockwise/anticlockwise rotation of the embayment. In general, the SAM shows little influence on embayment variability. While it is clear that beach oscillation is driven by cross-shore processes, to what extent beach rotation is a longshore and/or cross-shore phenomena requires further investigation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wave climate</field><field name="subject">Embayed beaches</field><field name="subject">Coastal imaging</field><field name="subject">ENSO</field><field name="subject">Southern annular mode</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning and discovery in incremental knowledge acquisition</field><field name="creator">Suryanto, Hendra, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Knowledge Based Systems (KBS) have been actively investigated since the early period of AI. There are four common methods of building expert systems: modeling approaches, programming approaches, case-based approaches and machine-learning approaches. One particular technique is Ripple Down Rules (RDR) which may be classified as an incremental case-based approach. Knowledge needs to be acquired from experts in the context of individual cases viewed by them. In the RDR framework, the expert adds a new rule based on the context of an individual case. This task is simple and only affects the expert???s workflow minimally. The rule added fixes an incorrect interpretation made by the KBS but with minimal impact on the KBS's previous correct performance. This provides incremental improvement. Despite these strengths of RDR, there are some limitations including rule redundancy, lack of intermediate features and lack of models. This thesis addresses these RDR limitations by applying automatic learning algorithms to reorganize the knowledge base, to learn intermediate features and possibly to discover domain models. The redundancy problem occurs because rules created in particular contexts which should have more general application. We address this limitation by reorganizing the knowledge base and removing redundant rules. Removal of redundant rules should also reduce the number of future knowledge acquisition sessions. Intermediate features improve modularity, because the expert can deal with features in groups rather than individually. In addition to the manual creation of intermediate features for RDR, we propose the automated discovery of intermediate features to speed up the knowledge acquisition process by generalizing existing rules. Finally, the Ripple Down Rules approach facilitates rapid knowledge acquisition as it can be initialized with a minimal ontology. Despite minimal modeling, we propose that a more developed knowledge model can be extracted from an existing RDR KBS. This may be useful in using RDR KBS for other applications. The most useful of these three developments was the automated discovery of intermediate features. This made a significant difference to the number of knowledge acquisition sessions required.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Machine learning</field><field name="subject">Knowledge acquisition (Expert systems)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speech recognition using hybrid system of neural networks and knowledge sources.</field><field name="creator">Darjazini, Hisham</field><field name="description">In this thesis, a novel hybrid Speech Recognition (SR) system called RUST (Recognition Using Syntactical Tree) is developed. RUST combines Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with a Statistical Knowledge Source (SKS) for a small topic focused database. The hypothesis of this research work was that the inclusion of syntactic knowledge represented in the form of probability of occurrence of phones in words and sentences improves the performance of an ANN-based SR system. The lexicon of the first version of RUST (RUST-I) was developed with 1357 words of which 549 were unique. These words were extracted from three topics (finance, physics and general reading material), and could be expanded or reduced (specialised). The results of experiments carried out on RUST showed that by including basic statistical phonemic/syntactic knowledge with an ANN phone recognisor, the phone recognition rate was increased to 87% and word recognition rate to 78%. The first implementation of RUST was not optimal. Therefore, a second version of RUST (RUST-II) was implemented with an incremental learning algorithm and it has been shown to improve the phone recognition rate to 94%. The introduction of incremental learning to ANN-based speech recognition can be considered as the most innovative feature of this research. In conclusion this work has proved the hypothesis that inclusion of a phonemic syntactic knowledge of probabilistic nature and topic related statistical data using an adaptive phone recognisor based on neural networks has the potential to improve the performance of a speech recognition system.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">speech</field><field name="subject">automatic speech recognition</field><field name="subject">neural networks</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/17869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fast, accurate pitch detection tools for music analysis</field><field name="creator">McLeod, Philip</field><field name="description">Precise pitch is important to musicians. We created algorithms for real-time pitch detection that generalise well over a range of single &#65533;voiced&#65533; musical instruments. A high pitch detection accuracy is achieved whilst maintaining a fast response using a special normalisation of the autocorrelation (SNAC) function and its windowed version, WSNAC. Incremental versions of these functions provide pitch values updated at every input sample. A robust octave detection is achieved through a modified cepstrum, utilising properties of human pitch perception and putting the pitch of the current frame within the context of its full note duration. The algorithms have been tested thoroughly both with synthetic waveforms and sounds from real instruments. A method for detecting note changes using only pitch is also presented. 
 Furthermore, we describe a real-time method to determine vibrato parameters - higher level information of pitch variations, including the envelopes of vibrato speed, height, phase and centre offset. Some novel ways of visualising the pitch and vibrato information are presented.

The kakapo (Strigops habroptilus, Gray 1845) is a critically endangered, lek breeding, flightless nocturnal parrot endemic to New Zealand. In April 1998, a total population of fifty-six kakapo was known to survive on offshore islands. Twenty-six kakapo, thirteen males and thirteen females, were temporarily transferred to Pearl Island (518 ha), southern Stewart Island, from April 1998 to April 1999. The translocation of kakapo to Pearl Island, and subsequent breeding season, provided an ideal experimental framework to study kakapo dispersal, movement patterns, home range development, habitat selection, and lek development during the non-breeding and breeding seasons. A total of 4425 radio locations were analysed for all twenty-six birds, with a mean error polygon of 0.03 ha and an estimated average radio telemetry error of 21.6 m. 
 Various home range analysis techniques were used to estimate kakapo home range size and overlap including: minimum convex polygons (MCP), modified minimum convex polygons (MMCP), harmonic mean analysis, adaptive kernel methods and cluster analysis. Estimates of kakapo home range size differed significantly depending on the method used (ANOVA, general linear model: F&#8321;&#8323;, &#8321;&#8320;&#8327;&#8326; = 63.99, p &lt; 0.0001) and the season (F&#8322;, &#8321;&#8320;&#8327;&#8326; = 160.75, p &lt; 0.0001). Breeding home range size was significantly larger than non-breeding range size (mean difference = 67.6 ha, t&#8322;&#8325; = 15.27, p &lt; 0.0001). Calculations from 100% MCP and 95% harmonic mean analysis resulted in larger estimates of home range size and overlap compared to other methods. Cluster and kernel analyses appeared to give the most accurate home range representation for kakapo. Core home range areas showed a greater degree of similarity between methods. Male and female mean annual home range size did not differ significantly, whereas males had significantly (p &lt; 0.05) larger home ranges than females during the nonbreeding season. Minimum convex polygons and harmonic mean analysis suggested that there was no significant difference in the way in which males and females interacted with each other. Kernel and cluster analyses indicated that females would overlap a greater proportion of another bird&#65533;s home range than males would. Cluster analysis also indicated that a female would have more of her home range occupied by another bird than a male would. The fact that different methods produced different quantitative results is an important consideration when using home range analysis to make conservation management decisions. Researchers must determine which method is the most appropriate for a particular research objective, species, or study area. 
 The application of geographical information systems, ERDAS image classification techniques and global positioning systems was an integral part of this study. A large-scale vegetation classification map of Pearl Island was produced in order to quantify habitat selection by kakapo. The unsupervised classification technique produced the least accurate vegetation map, with an accuracy measure of 17-23%, compared to 52% for the supervised classification. The highest accuracy was obtained using an integrated approach involving inductive classification and deductive mapping, resulting in a vegetation classification map which correctly classified 95% of vegetation samples. Thirty-seven ecotone classes were identified and a total ecotone length of approximately 124 km was detected. 
 Resource selection ratios and resource selection functions were estimated using a combination of discrete, continuous and area-based habitat variables. Circular buffers around used and available point locations were generated to determine whether kakapo selectively use vegetation mosaics. The probability of selection increased with increasing species diversity in each 75-metre radius buffer. Kakapo selected habitat mosaics and vegetation types with higher species diversity and moderate to high abundance of mature rimu and yellow silver pine trees.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kakapo</field><field name="subject">behavior</field><field name="subject">home range</field><field name="subject">habitat</field><field name="subject">habitat selection</field><field name="subject">wildlife relocation</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Pearl Island</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090409.135626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poetics in the digital age : media-specific analysis of experimental poetry on and off the screen</field><field name="creator">Muller, Sandra</field><field name="description">As an alternative to print media, digital media make us newly aware of the materiality of experimental poetic texts and require us to account for their media-specific differences. Although already several theoretical models have been put forward to define these differences, so far few poems have been analyzed in terms of their media-specific textual materiality. This thesis seeks to fill this gap in the applied media-specific analysis of experimental poetry. It combines traditional close reading with a media-specific approach in order to investigate the relationship between the physical characteristics and signifying strategies of four experimental poetic texts in various digital and non-digital media. It critically interrogates the specific use of the given medium in each poem, and illustrates that their respective textual materiality cannot be specified in advance based on general assumptions concerning the medium in question. A digital poem is not inherently more innovative than a non-digital poem. Rather, a poem is perceived as innovative if it resists conventional reading strategies by establishing a particularly complex, dynamic, and effectively anomalous sense of textual materiality, which necessarily only emerges from the direct interplay among text, object, and reader.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">experimental poetry</field><field name="subject">computer poetry</field><field name="subject">Susan Howe (1937-)</field><field name="subject">Stephanie Strickland</field><field name="subject">John Cayley</field><field name="subject">Kenneth Goldsmith</field><field name="subject">poetics</field><field name="subject">digital media</field><field name="subject">literature and technology</field><field name="subject">textual criticism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090501.132423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moving beyond acknowledgment : an investigation of the role of spirituality and religion within the professional practice of social work in Aotearoa/New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stirling, Blair</field><field name="description">For the past two decades there has been an ever expanding interest in the implications of spirituality and, or, religion within the professional practice of social work (Anderson and Angell, 1999; Bishop, Avila-Juarbe, &amp; Thumme, 2003; Cornett, 1992; Northcut, 1999; Northcut, 2000; Praglin, 2004 ; Sheridan, Wilmer and Atcheson,1994). Increasingly, scholars and social workers alike have been considering the appropriateness of inclusion and the practical implications involved. This interest has developed to include attention to spirituality within varying ethical codes and definitions of social work. This is evident in international social work organisations such as the IFSW (International Federation of Social Workers) and IASSW (International Association of Schools of Social Work). Both have begun to include religious and, or, spiritual concerns into professional practice principles. In Aotearoa New Zealand the Aotearoa New Zealand Association of Social Workers (ANZASW) is a member of these international bodies; thus the profession is bound to the above principles. 
 Additionally, the Aotearoa New Zealand Social Workers Registration Board (SWRB) code of practice reflects the standards and ethical codes of the ANZASW. Moreover, spirituality and, or, religion is an important aspect for different client groups within the Aotearoa social services context. This is particularly so within bicultural frameworks. Despite this, little attention has been given to exploring how social workers and social service agencies in Aotearoa New Zealand integrate this aspect in their work with clients to meet the varying ethical requirements. Additionally, little investigation has been undertaken to explore the implications religion and, or, spirituality might have within the Aotearoa New Zealand Social Services context. To date a number of conversations have occurred with regard to spirituality and religious concerns for Tangata Whenua, and to a lesser degree Tagata Pasifika. This study seeks to address the paucity of information by undertaking a mixed methods investigation of the role religion and spirituality has within Aotearoa New Zealand social work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social workers</field><field name="subject">social service</field><field name="subject">social work with minorities</field><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">religious life</field><field name="subject">religious aspects</field><field name="subject">Maori (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">Aotearoa New Zealand Association of Social Workers</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090608.162028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Knowing' sustainable development in the business arena</field><field name="creator">Byrch, Christine</field><field name="description">A growing knowledge of the human impact on the environment has led to widespread dissatisfaction with the current relationship between industrial societies and the nature that sustains them. From within this milieu, sustainable development has emerged as a term that describes an appropriate relationship in the context of the present time and culture. Although it has been widely adopted by many individuals and organisations, there is little agreement as to what it means and entails. 
 Business has been attributed a significant role in achieving sustainable development. Many have joined the sustainable development debate and received both accolades and critique for their endeavours to interpret and implement the concept within the business sector. Consideration of the prominent and influential role of business in industrial societies, and the lack of definition, elicits the question: what do those people who have taken up the challenge of applying the principles of sustainable development to the business sector think the term means? 
 In response, I have explored participants&#65533; subjective knowledge of the meaning of sustainable development within the broad context of humanity&#65533;s relationship with nature. In this context, sustainable development is just one of many views of the &#65533;proper&#65533; relationship incumbent within environmentalism, and which variously critique industrial society&#65533;s relationship with nature. A cognitive approach was adopted that suggests how a society views and uses nature arises from its culture; and that an individual&#65533;s vision of nature is influenced by their personal environmental worldview, encompassing fundamental beliefs regarding the underlying nature of reality and guidelines for living. 
 The views of forty-eight individuals active in New Zealand&#65533;s &#65533;sustainable business arena&#65533; were investigated. Participants were drawn from businesses purported to be adopting the principles of sustainable development and organisations assisting in this endeavour. Their knowledge was explored by means of cognitive mapping, semi structured questioning, and Q Methodology. 
 Not surprisingly, participants held a variety of normative and subjective understandings of sustainable development that appear to have arisen from &#65533;life in general&#65533; rather than any external source. Although humanity, the environment, and change were considered central to sustainable development, beyond this were contested notions and priorities as each participant described their vision for the future, each challenging various aspects of our industrial society, to varying degrees. Five ideal-type views were characterised and termed the Societalist, Individualist, Ecologist, Realist, and Futurist views. The five ideal-type views are presented as a typology, constructed from relevant and prioritised worldview beliefs, that highlights the major contradictions. Considered in this way, consensus on the meaning of sustainable development seems unlikely. And perhaps sustainable development is not one thing but instead a reflexive culture of change such that we question how we live. 
 Hitherto, extant sustainable development literature has highlighted the power of business over society. In contrast, in this research, participants reported their attempts to implement sustainable development within business were constrained by society&#65533;s requirements and institutions. Further, understanding of sustainable development was observed to be learnt from our culture, highlighting at a more fundamental level, the sway of society on sustainable business.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090615.101310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The functional morphology of the human thoracolumbar transversospinal muscles</field><field name="creator">Cornwall, Jonathan Edgar</field><field name="description">The thoracolumbar transversospinal muscles are vital in normal function and are implicated in the pathogenesis of different forms of spinal pathology and pain. They are the target for specific forms of clinical intervention such as exercise regimens and the release of &#65533;trigger points&#65533;, and are often analysed through imaging studies and electromyographic recordings. 
 Despite the importance of these muscles, there is a paucity of knowledge in regard to aspects of their functional morphology. The aim of this thesis was to examine the thoracolumbar transversospinal muscles between the mid-thoracic spine and sacrum, examining their gross morphology, fibre arrangement, fibre types, and an animal model in order to provide a better understanding of their functional morphology. 
 The gross morphology of these muscles was studied by micro-dissection of cadaveric material. Their form was found to differ from that published in either text book or peer reviewed articles, clearly indicating the existence of a &#65533;semispinalis&#65533; muscle in the lumbar spine. In addition, the arrangement of these muscles was found to be homologous between the thoracic and lumbar regions, which is contrary to published descriptions. 
 Arrangement of the muscle fibres was examined by identifying motor endplates with acetylcholinesterase histochemistry in all muscles throughout the area of interest. Only one endplate per fibre was observed, and no in-series fibres were found. All muscles showed a complex multipinnate form with large areas of muscle tendon intruding into each muscle. 
 Fibre type proportions in each muscle were investigated by immunohistochemistry. Results indicate the percentage of total muscle area occupied by type I fibres decreased the more caudad the vertebral level of origin, for all muscles. There were significant differences in the area percentage of type I fibres between many different vertebral levels. These differences were mostly found between the most cranial and most caudal levels examined. The percentage of type I fibres recorded suggest all muscles are likely postural in function, and the gradual decrease in type I fibres and the lack of a distinct thoracic / lumbar boundary in the data suggests the thoracic and lumbar transversospinal muscles are homologous. 
 The thoracolumbar transversospinal muscles of the MLC3F nlacZ transgenic mouse were micro-dissected to determine their morphology, and their fibre arrangement subsequently determined using acetylcholinesterase histochemistry. These muscles showed a homogeneous form throughout the thoracolumbar spine, and no in-series muscle fibres were observed with all muscles having one motor endplate per fibre. Results indicated similarities between the morphology of mouse and human transversospinal muscles, perhaps indicative of an adaptation to an upright posture. 
 This thesis provides information that facilitates a more complete understanding of the morphology and function of the thoracolumbar transversospinal muscles. In addition, results indicate that these muscles are homologous through the thoracic and lumbar spine, and therefore the classification and nomenclature used to describe these muscles should be re-examined. Furthermore, the morphological evidence, combined with recent embryological studies, supports the use of the term &#65533;spinotransverse&#65533; to more accurately describe this muscle group.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spine</field><field name="subject">muscles</field><field name="subject">mechanical properties</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">etiology</field><field name="subject">anatomy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090615.144650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A rising tide : the growth of Evangelicalism and Evangelical identity among Presbyterians, Anglicans and University students in New Zealand, 1930-1965</field><field name="creator">Lange, Stuart</field><field name="description">This thesis relates the resurgent evangelical Protestantism of mid-twentieth century New Zealand to the extensive international historiography which has emerged over the last thirty years, especially through the work of such scholars as David Bebbington in Britain and others in the USA, Canada and Australia. Understanding evangelicalism as a both an historical movement and a recurring set of doctrinal commitments, the new literature has highlighted evangelicalism as a trans-denominational and international movement, sharing such features as those identified in Bebbington&#65533;s quadrilateral. Weaving together the study of numerous key individuals, churches and organisations, the thesis argues that a self-aware, cross-denominational and fairly cohesive evangelical stream developed within New Zealand Protestantism between about 1930 and 1965. The thesis demonstrates that the university Evangelical Unions and the Inter-Varsity Fellowship (NZ) - both founded following a schism with the more liberal SCM in the early 1930s - were key factors in the reconstruction of evangelical identity and confidence and in the development of vigorous and expanding evangelical movements in New Zealand&#65533;s two largest Protestant denominations. The two key pre-war church leaders who inspired those movements, Thomas Miller (a confessionalist Presbyterian) and William Orange (a devotional Anglican), worked closely with the Evangelical Unions and IVF, and the leaders of the post-war evangelical movements (such as Graham Miller) had been significantly shaped by the EUs and IVF. Mid-century New Zealand evangelicalism was theologically conservative, but also emphasised reason, moderation and restraint, and those values were constantly reinforced by such leaders as Dr. John Laird and Professor E.M. Blaiklock. The renascent New Zealand evangelical movement rejected extremism, anti-intellectualism and ecclesiastical separatism. It explicitly distanced itself from American fundamentalism. In its outlook and cultural style, mid-twentieth century New Zealand evangelicalism largely reflected the prevailing Britishness of New Zealand in that period, and was strongly influenced by the British IVF. By the early 1960s, evangelicalism had become an increasingly significant element within Protestantism in New Zealand. As the movement matured, it had also become less cohesive.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">christian college students</field><field name="subject">religious life</field><field name="subject">evangelicalism</field><field name="subject">student movements</field><field name="subject">Inter-Varsity Fellowship of Evangelical Unions (N.Z.)</field><field name="subject">Presbyterian Church of New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Church of the Province of New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Thomas Miller (1875-1948)</field><field name="subject">William Orange (1889-1966)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090618.161648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dental workforce in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ayers, Kathryn M. S</field><field name="description">Each of the seven investigations described in this thesis relate to the dental workforce in New Zealand (NZ). A variety of approaches were used to identify key trends in the NZ dental workforce, with a particular emphasis on comparing dental therapists, dental hygienists and dentists, and determining differences among dentists according to gender and immigrant status. 
 Nation-wide postal surveys of dentists, dental therapists, and dental hygienists were undertaken to determine the working practices and career satisfaction of each type of oral health professional. A longitudinal analysis of the dentist workforce was then undertaken to describe changes in the NZ dentist workforce over time. An investigation of the job stressors and coping strategies of New Zealand dentists followed. This led to a qualitative study of the experiences of immigrant dentists in NZ, which sought further detail regarding the concerns raised by the Stress Study. The final investigation was a survey of the self-reported occupational health of NZ dentists, which built on from the results of the preceding studies. 
 There were substantial differences in the working practices of male and female dentists. A greater proportion of female dentists had taken a career break of six weeks or more, usually to care for children. Larger proportions of women worked as employees or practice associates, and worked part-time. Women also planned to retire earlier than male respondents. Men were more active in continuing professional education and had higher career satisfaction. 
 The career satisfaction of dental therapists and dental hygienists was similar, but dental therapists were much less satisfied with their income, and few felt a valued part of the dental community. Although many dental hygienists had taken substantial career breaks for childrearing, they were shorter than those taken by dental therapists. More therapists than hygienists planed to retire within the next 10 years. 
 Over the nine-year period from 1997 to 2005, there was a significant increase in the number of women and overseas-trained dentists in the workforce. The proportion of dentists working in small towns decreased, and the percentage working part-time increased. The involvement of dentists in continuing professional development increased during that time. 
 There was considerable variation in the number of stressors experienced by dentists, with overseas-qualified practitioners reported experiencing more stressors more frequently than did those trained in NZ. There were differences in the strategies used by male and female dentists to manage stress. 
 Most immigrant dentists had found the dental registration examination process to be difficult and stressful. Uncertainty about the content of the examination and the high costs involved were key factors. Contact with practicing dentists during this time was found to be helpful. 
 Overall, most dentists had good general health, but physical fitness levels were not ideal. The prevalence of hand dermatoses and musculoskeletal problems was high, with around 60% of dentists experiencing pain or discomfort. Workplace bullying was reported by 20% of dentists, and over 25% had experienced a violent or abusive incident. 
 There is a need for ongoing monitoring of the workforce, particularly as the gender distribution (and societal trends and expectations) continues to change. Further support systems for immigrant dentists would be beneficial. Female and rural dentists also have unique circumstances and increased risk of professional isolation. Researchers and the professions will watch with interest the changes over the next decade as dual-qualified auxiliaries enter the dental workforce and public dental services are redeveloped.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dentists</field><field name="subject">dental hygienists</field><field name="subject">supply and demand</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090626.142511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human migration in prehistoric Northeast Thailand</field><field name="creator">Cox, Katharine</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to examine the scale of human migration in three prehistoric settlements in the Upper Mun River Valley (UMRV) Northeast Thailand, from c. 1700BC - AD500. Archaeological data implies migration may have had a central role in the development of agriculture and later metal technology in the region, which is suggested to show increased social complexity over this important stage in the development of states in mainland Southeast Asia. The scale of these migrations, however, are not known and based on archaeological evidence it is unclear whether there were large numbers of individuals migrating into the region in order to bring about the changes seen in the archaeological record. 
 Two potentially complementary-methods are used to identify the extent of migration in the UMRV in this thesis. The first method, the study of dental morphological traits, is used as an indication of genotype of 78 prehistoric individuals. The second method is isotope analysis of the dental enamel of 74 individuals, used as indicators of childhood residence and diet. Strontium (Sr), Carbon (C) and Oxygen (O) isotopes are analysed. The first method reflects an individual&#65533;s genetic heritage through inherited traits, while the second method is an indication of an individual&#65533;s migration during their lifetime. Together, these methods may provide a powerful means to assess the scale of migration over an extended period of time in this region. 
 As it has been posited that the introduction of agriculture is related to migration of people into the region, the current study hypothesises that while immigrants would be identified from outside the UMRV during all phases of occupation at the sites, this would be particularly so during the earlier phases. It is also hypothesised through analysis of the morphological traits that genetic relationships at each site could be suggested. Finally, it is also hypothesised that individuals with evidence for infectious diseases, which are otherwise rare in the region, would be immigrants. 
 The frequencies of the dental morphological traits at each site are calculated, and a local pattern for each site developed. The results from the morphological traits suggest low levels of migration into the UMRV, and overall group homogeneity. Despite this homogeneity, it is suggested that several individuals may have been from a different genetic pool to others at the sites, reflected in a different combination of dental traits. There is also some evidence for genetic relationships between individuals, and over time, possibly indicating familial relationships at the sites. 
 Stability in the Sr isotopes over time suggest a local signature for the UMRV. Sr isotopes did not support a hypothesis of large-scale immigration into the UMRV, as there were few isotopic outliers identified. Those individuals with clear outlier Sr results, and therefore probable immigrants, were predominately female. All phases of occupation of the UMRV attracted some long-range inward movement of people, although the data suggests long-range migration diminished over time. 
 [delta]&#65533;&#65533;C values show no significant change over time, possibly supporting the Sr data of limited migration into the region. While the interpretation of this isotope is primarily from a perspective of migration it is recognised that this may be limited to understanding variation in diet in the individuals. [delta]&#65533;&#8312;O values show significant change over time (p = 0.00, ANOVA), perhaps consistent with previous research which suggested increased aridity in the UMRV. An alternative explanation of the [delta]&#65533;&#8312;O data is that migration increased with time, with people who were differentiated by their O isotopes but not their Sr, however the increased aridity hypothesis is favoured here. 
 The hypothesis that individuals with evidence for infectious disease would be long-range immigrants into the region is rejected. None of the individuals who had physical evidence for infectious disease had chemical data to support their being immigrants. 
 The putative migrants to the UMRV are presented as case studies, assessing the complementarity of the methods used. It is argued that given the changes in the environment over time in the UMRV the area may have become less attractive to immigrants and as a result the communities may have become more insular. The data yielded from the two methods have demonstrated the value of using inherited dental traits together with isotopic data of individual migration for investigating human mobility in the past. Using these methods, this study shows that there were low levels of migration into the UMRV and that long-range migration was more frequent in the earliest phases of occupation in the region.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anthropometry</field><field name="subject">ethnoarchaeology</field><field name="subject">human remains (archaeology)</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">prehistoric peoples</field><field name="subject">internal migration</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090626.150746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fate of the mammalian myotome and its role in morphogenesis of epaxial muscles</field><field name="creator">Deries, Marianne</field><field name="description">The myotome is a segmented skeletal muscle developing along the axis and is the first muscle to differentiate in every vertebrate. While fish and tadpole myotomes persist during development, myotomes of amniote embryos disappear during embryogenesis and are replaced by the long and complex epaxial muscles. Whereas the initial development of the myotome has been intensely investigated, very little is known about the fate of the myotome and the morphogenesis of the epaxial muscles in mammals. 
 This study firstly examined epaxial muscle morphogenesis. Myotomal fibres and cell death in muscle fibres were followed by immunohistochemistry during rat embryogenesis. Results showed that the morphogenesis of epaxial muscles occurs through the movement of the differentiated myotomal muscle fibres rather than by de novo fusion of myoblasts after apoptosis of the initial myotomal myofibres. The myotomal muscle masses undergo progressive transformation and segregation that result in the formation of the distinct groups of epaxial muscles. 
 Next, the mechanisms of epaxial muscle morphogenesis were investigated in rat embryos, by following muscle progenitor cells expressing the transcription factors Pax7 and Pax3 during epaxial muscle morphogenesis using immunohistochemistry. This demonstrated that the myoblasts responsible for epaxial muscle growth derive from a population of progenitors mingled within the epaxial muscle masses as they segregate from the myotome. No migration of precursors is involved. 
 Transgenic ScxGFP mouse embryos, carrying a marker green fluorescent protein under the control of scleraxis (a transcription factor specific to tendons and muscle connective tissues), permitted the tracing of the connective tissues during myotome transformation. Results strongly suggest that connective tissues associated with epaxial myofibres could be actively involved in creating the displacement of the myotomal myofibres during the transformation process. 
 Finally, to test whether the mammalian myotome has a function as a neurally-controlled muscle during development, innervation of the myotome was studied using immunohistochemistry in comparison with the innervation of the forelimb muscles of rat embryos. The results were striking, showing that whereas the migratory limb muscles are contacted by nerves from the beginning of their differentiation, the myotome differentiates and then develops over more than two days without nerves. As revealed by the appearance of acetylcholine receptors clusters, functional innervation only occurs in the epaxial muscles when the myotome has started its transformation. The true mammalian myotome is therefore never innervated and seems to have lost its role as a neurally-controlled muscle in contrast to the myotomal muscle of fish and amphibian tadpoles. 
 Overall the results indicate that the development of the epaxial muscles is strikingly different from that of the muscles originating from migratory myoblasts. Contrary to the migratory muscles, the myotome develops in the absence of nerves and its differentiated muscle fibres are transformed in position and orientation to create the epaxial muscles. The development of mammalian epaxial muscles upon a template of embryonic muscle resembles the development of some adult muscles in Drosophila, developing from the larval muscles. This suggests that the mammalian myotome could be of a larval nature but with the loss of innervation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">morphogenesis</field><field name="subject">muscles</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090702.134656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Therapeutic potential of SERM and EGCG drug combinations for the treatment of basal-like breast cancer</field><field name="creator">Stuart, Emma</field><field name="description">Basal-like breast cancer represents a subgroup of mammary cancers associated with a particularly poor prognosis, as they are refractory to current targeted therapies employed for the treatment of breast cancer. In this work I aimed to explore the therapeutic potential of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), a targeted breast cancer treatment, in combination with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), for the treatment of basal-like breast cancer, using MDA-MB-231 cell as an in vitro model of the disease. A significant reduction in MDA-MB-231 cell number and a significant increase in cytotoxicity was observed following treatment with 25 [mu]M of EGCG in combination with 1 [mu]M of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) (EGCG+4-OHT) or 4 [mu]M of raloxifene (EGCG+Ral) over a 36 h time course. However, these effects were not resolved in time, with an increase in G&#8321;-phase cell cycle arrest. Changes in the metabolism of EGCG were dismissed as a possible mechanism through which the combination treatments may be eliciting the cytotoxicity. Changes in the expression and phosphorylation of various signaling proteins, important for the proliferation and survival of basal-like breast cancer, were investigated through Western blotting. 
 Interestingly, the two combination treatments produced very similar results; reductions in the phosphorylation of EGFR and AKT occurred after 6, 12, and 18 h with EGCG+4-OHT and 6, 12, 18 and 24 h with EGCG+Ral, while a reduction in S6K phosphorylation was observed following 6, 12, 18 and 24 h of both combination treatments. Interestingly, both SERMs contributed significantly to the net reduction in S6K phosphorylation, induced by the combination treatments. Both combination treatments were also associated with a significant increase in the phosphorylation and total expression of stress activated protein kinases, p38 and JNK1/2 following 12, 18 and 24 h of treatment. As changes were observed at an intracellular signaling level, the effect of the combination treatments were investigated at the transcriptomic level after 18 h of treatment, using human oligonucleotide microarrays. This transcriptomic analysis revealed that both combination treatments reduced the transcript expression of five enzymes involved with cholesterol synthesis, which was confirmed through qRT-PCR. Cholesterol is an important component of the plasma membrane and is critical for the transduction of extracellular signals. Furthermore, both combination treatments induced the transcriptomic expression of the zinc coordinating metallothionein (MT) proteins. This was associated with an increased nuclear localization of MTF-1, the transcription factor responsible for MT expression, after 6, 12 and 18 h of both combination treatments. Finally, nuclear Western blotting of the NF-[kappa]B subunit, p65, revealed that both combination treatments reduced the nuclear localization of NF-[kappa]B following 6, 12 and 18 h. In collating this data, it appears that the combination treatments of EGCG+4-OHT and EGCG+Ral are inducing cytotoxicity through various mechanisms, including reduced cellular signaling through EGFR, AKT and S6K, increased stress signaling through JNK1/2 and p38 and altered gene expression of MTs and enzymes involved with cholesterol synthesis. Therefore, the combination treatment of EGCG+SERMs exhibits therapeutic potential in MDA-MB-231 cells, a model of basal-like breast cancer.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">breast</field><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">chemotherapy</field><field name="subject">basal cell carcinoma</field><field name="subject">estrogen</field><field name="subject">receptors</field><field name="subject">epigallocatechin gallate</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090708.090405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The many derelicts of the War? Great War veterans and repatriation in Dunedin and Ashburton, 1918 to 1928</field><field name="creator">Parsons, Gwen A</field><field name="description">The New Zealand Government&#65533;s repatriation measures to assist Great War veterans have largely been considered a failure. This thesis examines repatriation through the experiences of Dunedin and Ashburton veterans, demonstrating that within the context of the 1920s pre-welfare state these provisions proved to be both generous and far more successful than is often suggested. The Government&#65533;s repatriation response to returning veterans reflected contemporary attitudes towards dependency and need. Belief in self-reliance underpinned repatriation policy, with a stated aim of restoring veterans to the civil position they held prior to enlistment rather than providing assistance to move up the occupational ladder. Fear of the morally corrosive effect of dependency, as well as economic concerns, meant the repatriation provisions were principally concerned with ensuring veterans regained financial independence through employment. To that end war pensions compensated for lost earning power, rather than providing a full living income, and repatriation provisions largely consisted of assistance in finding jobs or obtaining farms and businesses. The Government&#65533;s repatriation provisions also reflected contemporary medical knowledge. The repatriation legislation restricted war pensions and free medical care to veterans with disabilities directly attributable to military service. However the link between military service and disability remained unclear in many cases. Slightly more than half of those discharged unfit suffered from sickness rather than wounds, many from conditions common among the civilian population. Contemporary aetiological knowledge often did not support the war pension applications lodged by returned soldiers disabled as a result of non-contagious disease, and an absence of clinical evidence undermined claims of latent illness. In addition the medical profession&#65533;s failure to adopt psychological theory and practice meant that by the early 1920s shell shock sufferers were treated according to psychiatric medicine&#65533;s understanding of mental illness. 
 Within the context of 1920s New Zealand the repatriation provisions were generous: the Repatriation Department&#65533;s work had no precedent; the war disabled were one of the few groups to receive state pensions and received more than other state pensioners; and the provisions of the soldier settlement scheme were available to all veterans, regardless of health, capital or farming experience. Despite the limited aims of the Government&#65533;s repatriation provisions many veterans did successfully re-establish themselves in civilian society. By the 1930s Ashburton soldier settlements had proved more successful than others in Canterbury, and compared well with other crown settlements in Ashburton County. More generally war service produced no dramatic change in the occupational structure of veterans: veterans generally retained their occupational status during the post-war decade, volunteers faring slightly better than conscripts but neither as well as their civilian counterparts. Although some veterans certainly did experience need and indigence after the war the majority of urban and rural men in the sample groups were financially stable, particularly after the boom and bust of the immediate post-war years. The men in the Dunedin and Ashburton sample groups represent the most successful of the returned soldier population nevertheless they show that a significant proportion of Great War veterans were successfully repatriated by the end of the post-war decade.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">World War (1914-1918)</field><field name="subject">repatriations</field><field name="subject">veterans</field><field name="subject">government policy</field><field name="subject">services for veterans</field><field name="subject">Dunedin</field><field name="subject">Ashburton</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090708.092730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crafting competence:
the governance of multiplicity in nursing</field><field name="creator">Grealish, Laurie</field><field name="description">Competence and competency assessment in nursing are promoted as necessary to ensure the quality of health care services. The dominant discourse in the international nursing community suggests that competence should be assured through some form of competency assessment, however competence is a controversial concept, with many different definitions. There are significant concerns about the validity and reliability of currently available assessment technologies. Rather than continue the debate about definitions and measurement, I take as my research aim the discovery of how what has come to count as competence became settled. The data for this study was drawn from textbooks, journal articles, meeting minutes, government reports, interviews with senior nurse leaders who were active in the development of the ANRAC Competencies and the ANCI Competency Standards 3e and RN preceptors who assess competence, group interviews with Clinical Development Nurses who assess competence, and observations of newly qualified nurses being assessed by Clinical Development Nurses. Newly qualified nurses were chosen as the focus for this study as they are formally assessed as part of Transition to Practice programs offered by health agencies around Australia. The study focuses on the period 1985 to 2005. Theories from the science, technology and social (STS) discipline informed the analysis. I found that rather than existing as a singular definable reality, competence exists in an undecided set of potentials and is momentarily reified in daily nursing practices in the form of competency standards assemblages. Combined, the semiotic (competence) - material (competency standard) assemblages are created by inventive assessors who work allegorically with multiple competences. This is not the work of assessing competence; rather it is the work of producing competence. The findings of this thesis offer new insight into competence and assessment technologies that can inform further research and development into the practices of competence assessment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="subject">new graduate</field><field name="subject">competency assessment</field><field name="subject">risk mangement</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20090818.152940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying sustainability for industry: a New Zealand electricity power sector case study</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Bernard Cho Ming</field><field name="description">Sustainable development is now being recognised as a vital component of our society in the environmental, ethical, social, technological, economic, and institutional aspects, or dimensions, so, this thesis develops a framework to quantitatively measure sustainability. This thesis is distinctive in that it focuses on quantitative methods encapsulated in a formal assessment procedure and includes sustainability concepts that have rarely been put into practical use in sustainability reports.  The framework is designed along the strategy that the methodology needs to be scale invariant and recursive, meaning the procedure is the same irrespective of the scale the user is interested in, and that different people can focus at different levels of sustainability by following a similar procedure. While the quantification process is aimed to be as unbiased as possible, a configuration of the tools from Total Quality Management (TQM) is adapted to identify sustainability indicators which are then mapped onto a scalar with mathematical functions. The sustainability indices are presented according to the amount of details needed by different users &#9472; some may need just one overall figure while others may need sustainability indices broken down by the six sustainability dimensions and presented on a spider diagram, while others may need all the details for analysis. This methodology also caters for sustainability analysis by different stakeholders. To fully demonstrate the potential of the methodology, the author has chosen to test it on a large-size industry sector so that it can have the capacity to be scaled up to a country or down to a small business, and on an industry sector that is important on its own right. Furthermore, this sector needs to be illustrative and has nontrivial complex problems. Under these criteria, the electricity sector of New Zealand was selected. The robustness of the methodology was investigated with inputs from three evaluators with different views: a standard view from the author that was made after much research in the sector and in the concepts of sustainability, a view with an environmental bias and one that focuses on commercial interests.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">TQM</field><field name="subject">Electricity sector</field><field name="subject">Sustainability index</field><field name="subject">Sustainability indicators</field><field name="subject">Quantify sustainability</field><field name="subject">Electricity spot price</field><field name="subject">Chaos</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between organizational fitness and business performance: specific evidence for SMEs</field><field name="creator">Young, Stuart Ian</field><field name="description">In today&#8217;s technological environment, organizational capabilities for managing change are regarded as important for business survival and growth. In particular, dynamic organizational capabilities have attracted considerable research interest over the past decade. Recently several studies have suggested that dynamic capabilities may be associated with a concept termed organizational fitness. What is not clear in this emerging research stream is whether firms with superior organizational fitness are more likely to prosper than unfit firms. In addition, relatively little attention has been directed toward creating a systemic model of dynamic capabilities that explains organizational fitness. The nature of fitness has been intensively debated in the biological sciences over a period of several decades. A confusing variety of fitness definitions have emerged from this literature. The lack of an agreed definition of fitness has resulted in several streams of research on organizational fitness. As a result of this fragmentation, there has been little progress toward answering the question of how to measure organizational fitness. The fragmentation in organizational fitness literature is problematic, because research into the relationship between organizational fitness and firm performance is not well-advanced. In this study, organizational fitness is defined in terms of organizational capability to produce variation. By defining fitness in this way, the tautological criticisms leveled against existing concepts of fitness are avoided. The definition of fitness proposed here accommodates both an evolutionary learning perspective and a perspective of strategic management, and thus reflects an integrative approach to the concept. A notable feature of the literature exploring organizational fitness is that it has been focused on large corporations. However, a growing body of literature suggests that SMEs are different from large firms and need to be examined in their own right.  SMEs are important contributors to business in most countries throughout the world.  This study addresses that perceived gap in the literature and asks: What relationship, if any, is there between organizational fitness and business performance for SMEs? Theory is developed and tested here by means of a large sample of SMEs in New Zealand. Two distinct aspects of organizational fitness are identified for SMEs. First, survival fitness is associated with generic combinative capabilities. Second, growth fitness is associated with knowledge assimilation and transformation. SME growth fitness and survival fitness are each found to be positively related to business performance under a variety of contexts. Further, an increase of growth fitness and survival fitness provides a means of alleviating selection pressures for SMEs. That is, dynamic capabilities of knowledge assimilation and integration are found to be positively associated with SME business performance.   In contrast to studies that advocate SME development of context-dependent capabilities, the findings of this study suggest an alternative perspective: variable selection pressures can be influenced by SMEs with a high level of survival and growth fitness.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SEM Structural equation modeling</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Organisational fitness</field><field name="subject">Variation</field><field name="subject">SME</field><field name="subject">Small to medium sized enterprises</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/671</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reactive milling of organic compounds</field><field name="creator">Li, Ying Yu</field><field name="description">Persistent organic pollutants are a well-known threat to the environment. Substances such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated organic compounds in contaminated soil and groundwater can have severe and long-lasting effects on health in animals and humans. There is an urgent need for the development of safe technologies for their effective removal. Originally developed for mineral processing, mechanical treatment by ball milling is an extremely versatile technique for the degradation of toxic compounds. Reactive milling can rapidly destroy organic compounds without producing hazardous wastes. Complete breakdown of the organic molecules is achieved after relatively short milling times. Successful tests were conducted on polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), DDT, DDD, DDE, Dieldrin and hexachlorobenzene with a conversion yield in the of greater than 99% (Hall et al., 1996; Monagheddu et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2002; Tanaka and Zhang, 2003; Pizzigallo et al., 2004; Nomura et al., 2005; Bellingham, 2006).In this study reactive ball milling was used to investigate the destruction of two classes of persistent organic pollutants environmental contaminants. The compounds studied are either known environmental pollutants or simple analogues. These were chosen as being representative of pollutants to investigate the pathway using ball milling destruction and in most cases were relatively small molecules so that the intermediates could be more easily identified. The first class of compounds was polycyclic aromatic compounds. Some smaller members of this class such as naphthalene, anthracene were investigated. The second class of compounds were some analogues of environmentally hazardous hydroxylated and halogenated compounds such as chloronaphthalene, bromonaphthalene, 1- naphthol, 2-naphthol and pentachlorophenol under reactive milling using GCMS analysis of the degradation pathway. Destruction efficiencies greater than 99% have been achieved for a number of organic compounds. Several different intermediates have been identified during the milling degradation. There was also some evidence from this study that halogens could be transferred between compounds during milling. The final products of the milling destruction of these compounds are an amorphous carbon residue and inorganic chloride or bromides. It was proposed that large amounts of halogens could be found however the results showed that small amounts detected. At early stages of milling a number of intermediate breakdown products were detected which were destroyed on extended milling. The core objective of this research was to clarify the reaction mechanisms pathways used of more complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic organ halogen compounds. This study is a part of a long-term research project on the destruction of toxic organic compounds by reactive milling.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organic reaction mechanisms</field><field name="subject">Organic compounds - Reactivity</field><field name="subject">Environmental chemistry</field><field name="subject">Enviornmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/261</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of attributional style in a call centre environment</field><field name="creator">Fulcher, Patricia Ann</field><field name="description">This study explored the relationship between attributional style and the performance of front line service staff in a call centre environment. Attributional style was evaluated using a well recognised method (Seligman's Attributional Style Questionnaire). This was the first time that the Seligman's Attributional Style Questionnaire (SASQ) has been used in a New Zealand context. Performance was calculated using five independent measures. These measures have been used for several years by the company at the centre of our study as an objective measure of Call Centre Representative (CCR) performance. The association between attributional style and performance was then examined using a combination of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and co relational analysis. People have different ways of reacting to adversity such as failure, rejection or a high-pressure situation. The ability to succeed is closely tied to the ability to handle adversity (DeCarlo et al., 1997; Seligman &amp; Schulman, 1986; Boone, 2000). Research has supported the common sense view that optimistic beliefs can be self-fulfilling prophecies (Sujan, 1999a; Porter, 2000; Furnham et al., 1994). Hundreds of studies have revealed the benefits of optimism such as increased motivation, superior achievement (in various areas e.g. work, school and sports), elevated mood and well-being, and better physical health (Seligman et al., 1990; Seligman et al., 1986). Furthermore, individuals can learn to reduce negative ways of thinking and become more optimistic when it is appropriate (Satterfield et al., 1997; Eronen et al., 1999; Bohart, 2002).Call centres are not new phenomena, however they have become a growth industry in the private and public sector over the last decade (Creagh, 1998). The following definition of call centres was used by Gilmore and Moreland; "A physical or virtual operation within an organisation in which a managed group of people spend most of their time doing business by telephone, usually working in a computer-automated environment." (2000, pg 4)Due to the size and the complexity of tasks undertaken within call centres, there is a growing need for empirical findings to broaden understanding of how to best manage call centres and how to optimise the utilisation of human capital (Feinberg et al, 2000).This cross-sectional study assesses the performance of Call Centre Representatives (CCRs) in a New Zealand based call centre and explores whether there is an association with the Seligman's Attributional Style Questionnaire (SASQ).It was found that the performance measure for soft skills varied significantly when ranked by a measure of optimism. The performance measures considered in this study focus mainly on technical competency and task efficiency, and were therefore not well explained by attributional style. Future research should investigate pre-testing for soft skills at recruitment, interventionist training on attitude and whether that translates into improved soft skill performance, and the reassessment of current call centre performance measurements.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Call centers</field><field name="subject">Employees</field><field name="subject">Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reduction of risk for lifestyle diseases: group diet and physical activity intervention in the workplace</field><field name="creator">Cumin, Michelle Brenda</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death in most Westernised countries. The prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cancers is rapidly increasing. Older people with elevated blood lipids, obesity and DNA damage are at high risk of developing these diseases. There is a plethora of research to support the claim that a healthy diet and increased physical activity can reduce the risk of increased body fatness, diabetes and generally improve health. However, most interventions require intensive one to one advice. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of a group approach to advising on changes in lifestyle with particular attention to foods high in fibre. The study spanned a period of 12 weeks with a follow up session at 52 weeks to ascertain sustainability. The study: This study was a 12 week longitudinal intervention study with a follow up after 52 weeks. Measurements of anthropometry (skin folds, girths, weight and height), blood pressure, body fat by bio impedance and fasting blood (lipids, glucose and insulin) were made at weeks 0, 3, 6, 9,1 2 and 52. The participants were asked to complete a food frequency questionnaire and a physical activity questionnaire at each of the 6 measuring sessions and to provide an indication of what the goals that they had set and if they had accomplished them after 9,12 and 52 weeks. Between measurements at weeks 0 and 3 the volunteers were left to follow their usual food and activity pattern. Then as a group they were given a diet and exercise talk and provided with written material and pedometers to increase motivation. After measurement at week 6 they were randomly divided into two groups. The first group (A) were prescribed and provided with kiwifruit at a dose of 100g/30 kg body weight for three weeks while the second group (B) continued with the changes in diet and physical activity. Following measurement at week 9 group A abstained from kiwifruit while Group B added the kiwifruit to their diet and the measurements repeated. After 52 weeks, with only emails as ongoing communication, they were remeasured. Results For this multicultural, relatively middle aged group of 53 staff (28 women, 25 men) of mean age 46 years, measurable and statistically significant metabolic gains were made in the lipid profile over 12 weeks. Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL all decreased and HDL increased significantly. Total cholesterol decreased from 5.6(&#177;1.1) mean (&#177;SD) mmol/L at baseline to 5.3(&#177;1.1) mmol/L at week 12 (p&lt;0.001); LDL cholesterol decreased from 3.5(&#177;0.97) mmol/L at baseline to 3.3(&#177;0.94) mmol/L at week 12 (p&lt;0.001); and total cholesterol to HDL ratio decreased from 4.0(&#177;1.1) to 3.7(&#177;0.9) (p&lt;0.001). In the 36 who were measured at 52- week follow- up these changes persisted. With the other outcome measures glucose showed a statistically but not biologically significant decrease over the 12 week period and body composition, blood pressure and insulin showed no significant change. The kiwifruit crossover had no apparent affect on the measures of any of the measurements reported. The participants reported that they increased fruit and vegetable and oily fish consumption and increased physical activity. These increases took place over the initial 12 week period and were maintained over 52 weeks. Conclusion: This study has shown that changes in diet and physical activity can favourably influence blood biochemistry even without accompanying changes in percentage body fat and weight. Furthermore, small, manageable lifestyle changes can result in biochemical changes persisting over 52 weeks.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lifestyles</field><field name="subject">Health aspects</field><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Employee health promotion</field><field name="subject">Physical fitness</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rebuilding lives after intimate partner violence in Aotearoa: women&#8217;s experiences ten or more years after leaving</field><field name="creator">Lewis, Rosalind</field><field name="description">My research focused on five women in Aotearoa naming and defining their experiences ten or more years after leaving an intimate partner violence relationship. An increasing amount of literature has been published reporting the prevalence of intimate partner violence among women in our society, including surveys documenting devastating short and long-term health effects. However, little has been published about the long-term experiences of women who have survived such abuse. I was interested in making more visible the experiences of long-term survivors of intimate partner violence. I wondered what the challenges and legacies from experiences of intimate partner violence are and what contributes to women rebuilding their lives after intimate partner violence. In this research utilised a participatory action research approach informed by a critical feminist theoretical perspective. I selected two data collection methods, individual interviews followed by a focus group interview bringing the participants together. The findings identified nineteen themes emerging from the individual and focus group interviews. Some expressed the long-term challenges and legacies of intimate partner violence, such as feelings of powerlessness, guilt and shame and feeling silenced. Others reflected ways women rebuilt their lives, such as empowerment, resilience, courage and the importance of education and meaningful work. Interpreting the findings, empowerment was often juxtaposed with powerlessness, living side by side within the inner world of the long-term survivor of intimate partner violence in equal tension. This study affirms that challenges and legacies from intimate partner violence continue to affect women many years after leaving violence. Despite these challenges and legacies, women work very hard to rebuild their lives, care for their children and attain autonomy, independence and control of their lives. Women spent time and energy to recover &#8216;well enough&#8217; from such violence, in order to lead a productive and functioning life.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Domestic violence</field><field name="subject">Family violence</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="subject">Post traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">Substance abuse</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Project risk management in smaller software teams</field><field name="creator">Crosby, Dave</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates project risk management issues in smaller software teams. Certain gaps in the literature are identified. There is limited literature on what risk management techniques software practitioners use. The studies that are published tend to focus on large software teams. This thesis investigates what risks these smaller teams consider to be important. It also investigates what techniques are perceived to address these risks and how effective those techniques are considered to be. One of those risks is found to be of primary importance, yet this risk is not suggested by the project management literature. This thesis goes on to conduct a more in-depth exploration of that specific risk in the context of these smaller teams Interviews were selected as the most appropriate method to achieve the objectives of the thesis. Nineteen interviews in eight software organisations are conducted to collect data for this thesis. Three different perspectives on project risk were investigated. Those were the perspectives of the; service managers, project managers and developers. Hence a large store of rich information is collated. The results are analysed and a rich set of information is presented in this thesis.  As a result of this research it is suggested that smaller software teams may find it useful to consider the 16 risks discussed in this research and how applicable those risks are to their individual organisation. Service managers may need to do more to raise the awareness of the importance of risks associated with &#8216;customer relationship issues&#8217; within their own organisations. Three risks stood out as areas where future research might be most fruitful. They were; customer relationship issues, introduction of new technology and unrealistic schedules and budgets. Risks related to customer relationship issues were of particular significance and have tended to be over looked in the project management literature. It is submitted that research into standard project risk management approaches may need to be combined with business risk management approaches to gain a full understanding of the risks faced and addressed by these smaller teams.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Project management</field><field name="subject">Software project</field><field name="subject">Small projects</field><field name="subject">Software development</field><field name="subject">Risk management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/378</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quadriceps strength prediction equations in individuals with ligamentous injuries, meniscal injuries and/or osteoarthritis of the knee joint</field><field name="creator">Colvin, Matthew</field><field name="description">The objective of this study was to investigate the accuracy of eleven prediction equations and one prediction table when estimating isoinertial knee extension and leg press one repetition maximum (1-RM) performance in subjects with knee injuries and knee osteoarthritis. Study Design: A descriptive quantitative research study was undertaken utilizing a cross-sectional design. Background: Traumatic injuries and osteoarthritis are common musculoskeletal pathologies that can disrupt normal function of the knee joint. A frequent sequela of these pathologies is quadriceps femoris muscle weakness. Such weakness can contribute to disability and diminished levels of functional and recreational activity. Therefore, safe and accurate methods of measuring maximal strength are required to identify and quantify quadriceps strength deficits. One option proposed in the literature is the use of 1-RM prediction equations which estimate 1-RM performance from the number of repetitions completed with sub-maximal loads. These equations have been investigated previously using healthy populations and subjects with calf muscle injuries. However, to date, no known study has investigated their accuracy in individuals with joint pathologies. Method: Machine-weight seated knee extension and seated leg press exercises were investigated in this study. Twenty subjects with knee injuries and 12 subjects with knee OA completed the testing procedures for the knee extension exercise. Nineteen subjects with knee injuries and 18 subjects with knee OA completed the testing procedures for the leg press exercise. All subjects attended the testing venue on three occasions. At the first visit a familiarization session was carried out. At the second and third visits each subject was randomly assigned to perform either actual or predicted 1-RM testing for both of the exercises. Twelve different prediction methods were used to estimate 1-RM performance from the results. The estimates of 1-RM strength were then compared to actual 1-RM performance to assess the level of conformity between these measures. Statistical procedures including Bland and Altman analyses, intraclass correlation coefficients, typical error and total error of measurement were used in the analyses of the results. In addition, paired t-tests were performed to determine whether actual 1-RM values were significantly different across the control and affected limbs and whether there were any significant differences in predictive accuracy for each equation across the control and affected limbs. Finally, the number of subjects with predicted 1-RM values within 5% or less of their actual 1-RM values was determined for each equation. Results: When the knee injury group performed the knee extension exercise, the Brown, Brzycki, Epley, Lander, Mayhew et al., Poliquin and Wathen prediction methods demonstrated the greatest levels of predictive accuracy. When two atypical subjects were identified and excluded from the analyses, the accuracy of these equations improved further. Following the removal of these two subjects, no significant differences in predictive accuracy were found for any of the equations across the affected and control limbs (p &gt; 0.05). Typical errors and total errors were low for the more accurate prediction methods ranging from 2.4-2.8% and from 2.4-3.5%, respectively. Overall, the Poliquin table appeared to be the most accurate prediction method for this sample (affected limbs: bias 0.3 kg, 95% limits of agreement (LOA) -5.8 to 6.4 kg, typical error as a coefficient of variation (COV) 2.4%, total error of measurement (total error) 2.4%; control limbs: bias -1.3 kg, 95% LOA -9.0 to 6.3 kg, typical error as a COV 2.7%, total error 2.8%). When the knee OA group performed the knee extension exercise, the Brown, Brzycki, Epley, Lander, Mayhew et al., Poliquin and Wathen prediction methods demonstrated the greatest levels of predictive accuracy. No significant differences in predictive accuracy were found for any of the equations across the affected and control limbs (p &gt; 0.05). When an atypical subject was identified and excluded from the analyses, the accuracy of the equations improved further. Typical errors as COVs and total errors for the more accurate prediction methods ranged from 2.5-2.7% and from 2.4-2.9%, respectively. Overall, the Poliquin table appeared to be the most accurate prediction method for this sample (affected limbs: bias 0.9 kg, 95% LOA -4.5 to 6.3 kg, typical error as a COV 2.5%, total error 2.5%; control limbs: bias -0.1 kg, 95% LOA -6.0 to 5.9 kg, typical error as a COV 2.5%, total error 2.4%). When the knee injury group performed the leg press, the Adams, Berger, Lombardi and O&#8217;Connor equations demonstrated the greatest levels of predictive accuracy. No significant differences in predictive accuracy were found for any of the equations across the affected and control limbs (p &gt; 0.05). Typical errors as COVs and total errors for the more accurate equations ranged from 2.8-3.2% and from 2.9-3.3%, respectively. Overall, the Berger (affected limbs: bias -0.4 kg, 95% LOA -7.2 to 6.3 kg, typical error as a COV 3.2%, total error 3.2%; control limbs: bias 0.1 kg, 95% LOA -6.6 to 6.7 kg, typical error as a COV 3.1%, total error 3.0%) and O&#8217;Connor equations (affected limbs: bias -0.6 kg, 95% LOA-6.8 to 5.7 kg, typical error as a COV 2.9%, total error 3.0%; control limbs: bias -0.2 kg, 95% LOA -6.9 to 6.4 kg, typical error as a COV 2.9%, total error 2.9%) appeared to be the most accurate prediction methods for this sample. When the knee OA group performed the leg press, the Adams, Berger, KLW, Lombardi and O&#8217;Connor equations demonstrated the greatest levels of predictive accuracy. No significant differences in predictive accuracy were found for any of the equations across the affected and control limbs (p &gt; 0.05). The typical errors as COVs and the total error values for the more accurate prediction methods were the highest observed in this study, ranging from 5.8-6.0% and from 5.7-6.2%, respectively. Overall, the Adams, Berger, KLW and O&#8217;Connor equations appeared to be the most accurate prediction methods for this sample. However, it is possible that the predicted leg press 1-RM values produced by the knee OA group might not have matched actual 1-RM values closely enough to be clinically acceptable for some purposes. Conclusion: The findings of the current study suggested that the Poliquin table produced the most accurate estimates of knee extension 1-RM performance for both the knee injury and knee OA groups. In contrast, the Berger and O&#8217;Connor equations produced the most accurate estimates of leg press 1-RM performance for the knee injury group, while the Adams, Berger, KLW and O&#8217;Connor equations produced the most accurate results for the knee OA group. However, the higher error values observed for the knee OA group suggested that predicted leg press 1-RM performance might not be accurate enough for some clinical purposes. Finally, it can be concluded that no single prediction equation was able to accurately estimate both knee extension and leg press 1-RM performance in subjects with knee injuries and knee OA.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quadriceps</field><field name="subject">Strength prediction equations</field><field name="subject">Knee OA</field><field name="subject">Knee injuries</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/379</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Raising half the sky: work&#8211;life balance of Chinese female administrative workers</field><field name="creator">Ma, Yan</field><field name="description">In recent years, a growing body of research has examined the issue of work&#8211;life balance (WLB). WLB initiatives have been developed by organisations, not only to aid employees in leading healthier and more satisfying lives, but to attract and retain talent. One area where WLB issues have not been examined in detail is from the perspective of Chinese immigrant women. As one of the largest and growing Asian ethnic groups, the WLB issues faced by Chinese women are especially worthy of being examined and addressed. The primary purpose of this research was to explore the WLB experience of Chinese women in administrative roles at Auckland University of Technology (AUT). It also aims to contribute to the body of knowledge on WLB issues for minority ethnic groups and investigated Chinese women&#8217;s coping strategies for integrating work with their non-work roles. An exploratory qualitative case study approach was adopted for this study in order to compare and contrast organisational initiatives and policies for WLB with women&#8217;s experiences. A triangulated research design was also employed to glean qualitative data by virtue of multiple methods including archival evidence such as publicly available documentation, secondary research on WLB and AUT&#8217;s WLB policies, and semi-structured interviews. This study involved 12 Chinese female administrative staff and three staff members from the Human Resource Department (HRD), the Asian Staff Network (ASN) and the AUT Branch of Tertiary Institutes Allied Staff Association (TIASA). Participants were recruited by utilising sources such as the Asian Staff Network (ASN) and the researcher&#8217;s network of contacts within AUT. The findings of the study indicated that Chinese women&#8217;s WLB experience and ways of handling work&#8211;family conflict (WFC) and family&#8211;work conflict (FWC) were affected by their experiences of immigration and cultural backgrounds. In particular, their family situation had a critical influence on the way they organised their households and arranged for childcare or eldercare. Child/elder care responsibilities, personal/family emergencies, and personal/individual sacrifice engendered tensions around their ability to integrate WLB. In addition, work factors such as heavy workloads, meeting deadlines, and working longer hours, and cultural barriers caused emotional stress and physical consequences.  While informal support from managers and colleagues and the WLB policies offered by the university helped women address their WLB issues, some policies were underutilised. A variety of coping strategies such as family members, win-lose strategies, time management, building clear boundaries, changing mindsets, and demonstrating commitment were actively adopted by Chinese women as mechanisms to cope with tensions between their work and family lives. The implications of these findings are discussed in light of the theory and practice of WLB.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Work&#8211;life balance in organizations</field><field name="subject">Chinese women</field><field name="subject">Immigration</field><field name="subject">Cultural experience in the  workplace</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Qualitative case study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radio on the internet: opportunities for new public spheres?</field><field name="creator">McEwan, Rufus William</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the potential for radio on the Internet to enhance processes of communication and media practice in the form of new a public sphere. Drawing on the work of Marshall McLuhan, the early stages of this thesis present an enquiry into the unique positive qualities of both radio and the Internet. The argument that follows contends that radio presented on the Internet can draw from the perceived technological benefits of each individual medium, combining as a potential site for public spheres. Both Habermas&#8217;s liberal public sphere and contemporary critiques of the concept are examined to define a range of principles that could be tested against relevant examples. The increasing commercialisation of the Internet is presented as a challenge to the normative ideals of a public sphere and counter-balances the optimism of a technologically determinist approach. A series of thematic codes are developed from the relevant theory and combined with qualitative interviews. This forms the framework for a thematic analysis of three individual case studies: Unwelcome Guests, an anti-corporate radio programme, SW Radio Africa, &#8220;the independent voice of Zimbabwe,&#8221; and NH Making Waves, the radio arm of a community peace activist group. The study investigates opportunities for these three individual case studies to act as public spheres, by examining the interplay that occurs between both Internet and radio practices. As the thematic analysis will demonstrate, placing radio content on the Internet presents new opportunities to diversify content and audiences through collaborative production and improved distribution. Recommendations for further research emphasise the need to pursue the Internet&#8217;s role in the public sphere potential of radio.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Digital radio</field><field name="subject">Political economy of the internet</field><field name="subject">Public sphere</field><field name="subject">New media</field><field name="subject">Thematic analysis</field><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physical demands of elite men&#8217;s field hockey and the effects of differing substitution methods on the physical and technical outputs of strikers during match play</field><field name="creator">Lythe, John</field><field name="description">Research has indicated that teams who cover greater distance during matches and complete more basic tasks such as passes, tackles and shots are more successful.  Identifying means of increasing these physical and technical outputs is therefore a significant opportunity for performance enhancement.  There has been limited research performed on hockey, especially at the elite level. An issue that is even more relevant given that in the past 15 years the sport has undergone some significant rule changes including the introduction of unlimited substitutions.  With sixteen players able to be used per match and eleven players on the field at any one time the coach can make substitutions as frequently as desired to try and maximise the overall performance of the team.  The objectives of this thesis were to use methods of performance analysis to measure the physical and technical outputs of players during elite hockey and to specifically measure the impact of differing substitution strategies on the physical and technical outputs of strikers during match play. Three striker conditions were assessed; three strikers with no substitutions, four strikers with a moderate amount of substitutions; and, five strikers with a large amount of substitutions.  Five matches between the New Zealand men&#8217;s hockey team and Tasmania state representative team were played over eight days.  Physical outputs of players were measured using portable GPS units and heart rate monitors and technical aspects of match play were measured using team performance statistics and a set of technical criteria which awarded points to strikers for each contribution they made to the game based upon a scale of effectiveness. Average total distance covered during 70 minutes by a position was 8160 &#177; 428m of which 479 &#177; 108m (6.1%) was performed at speeds greater than 19km.h-1.  Within this high intensity distance were 34 &#177; 12 sprints per player with an average duration of 3.3s.  Average match HR was 85.3 &#177; 2.9% HRmax and average peak HR was 96.3 &#177; 2.7% HRmax.  Distance covered decreased by 6.2% between the 1st and 2nd halves and there was a trend of decreasing distance in both halves when total distance was broken into five-minute time periods. When assessing the impact of substitutions on the performance of strikers it was found that there were no significant differences in physical outputs between conditions with total distance (S5 = 8414 &#177; 125m, S4 = 8422 + 34m; S3 = 8282m) and distance covered at speeds greater than 19km.h-1(S5 = 701 &#177; 46m, S4 = 685 &#177; 28m, S3 = 723m) being similar.  Substantial differences were found in technical outputs between the substitution conditions with more strikers and greater substitutions offering a better total output than less strikers and fewer substitutions (S5 = 241 &#177; 35, S4 = 207 &#177; 38, S3 = 173) but statistical significance between conditions was also not found. In conclusion, the results suggest that although substitutions are not a means to increase the physical work of strikers they do appear to be a way to enhance the contributions that strikers are making to the game.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hockey</field><field name="subject">GPS</field><field name="subject">Heart rate</field><field name="subject">Techincal outputs</field><field name="subject">Match analysis</field><field name="subject">Notational analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pseudoephedrine and its effect on performance : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Sport and Exercise Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Betteridge, Scott Sheng-yi</field><field name="description">Pseudoephedrine is a mild stimulant which partially mimics the action of noradrenaline and adrenaline. Recently, pseudoephedrine has been removed from the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) prohibited substances list. This occurred despite limited research in regards to its effects on sporting performance, and no studies on prolonged exercise performance (&gt;2hrs). There is some evidence to suggest pseudoephedrine may have an ergogenic effect at dosages exceeding therapeutic levels, possibly by masking fatigue. This study investigated the possible ergogenic effects of pseudoephedrine on endurance cycling performance. Using a double blind, randomised cross over design, eight well-trained cyclists (VO2max 69 &#177; 2 ml&#215;kg-1) performed two self- paced performance time trials at least 6 days apart. Ninety minutes prior to the trial, subjects consumed either placebo or pseudoephedrine (2.5 mg&#215;kg-1) capsules. Diet and exercise were controlled for 48 hrs prior to each trial. The time trial required completion of a set amount of work, equivalent to riding at two and half hours at a power output calculated to elicit 70% VO2 max. Power output was measured using a Powertap system (Cycle Ops Power, Saris Cycling Group, USA). Venous blood samples were collected prior to capsule ingestion, just before starting the trial, and at every 20% increment in completed work until completion and were analysed for glucose and lactate. Heart rate was recorded throughout the trial. There was no significant effect of pseudoephedrine on average performance (p=0.235). Heart rate was significantly higher with pseudoephedrine consumption compared to placebo (p&lt;0.05), but there was no significant difference in glucose or lactate between trials. Pseudoephedrine does not significantly improve self-paced endurance cycling performance, though the individual response was variable. However, exercising heart rate was significantly higher during exercise after ingestion of the stimulant.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ergogenic effects</field><field name="subject">cycling performance</field><field name="subject">heart rate</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321400 Human Movement and Sports Science::321401 Exercise physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/970</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organic agriculture: an empowering development strategy for small-scale farmers? A Cambodian case study : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Beban, Alice</field><field name="description">This thesis explores claims that organic agriculture may be an empowering development strategy by investigating the impacts of conversion to organic farming systems on the lives of small-scale farmers in Cambodia. The thesis interrogates the diverse uses and abuses of the term =empowerment&#8216; in development rhetoric and argues for an empowerment model that is derived from farmers&#8216; self-defined concepts of development. This model was used to conduct a qualitative case study involving semistructured interviews and focus groups with members of organics initiatives in seven diverse Cambodian communities. Results indicate that many farmers in all communities felt that their most important objective was not only to achieve food security, but to be able to grow sufficient rice to feed their family. Farmers joined the organics initiatives primarily to improve their health and reduce the cost of farming inputs. As a result of joining the initiatives, all farmers (including both certified and non-certified organic farmers) felt they had improved their health and food security. Most farmers also increased incomes, created stronger family and community ties and felt they had more control over their livelihoods. These benefits were not, however, distributed equally amongst individuals or communities. Very poor and isolated farmers could not generally access benefits. The three main factors that determined the impact of the organics initiatives on farmer empowerment were identified as: the individual&#8216;s level of resources, the strength of the farmer group, and the policies and values of the supporting organisation. The implications for future initiatives are, firstly, the tremendous potential for farmers and wider rural communities to benefit from organic agriculture as a development strategy. However, this study also shows that if organics is to be viable for low-resource people, it may be necessary to promote both resources and techniques in organics initiatives. Also, a focus on building strong relationships both within the farmers group and linkages with local and wider stakeholders may enhance long-term sustainability of organics initiatives.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organic farming</field><field name="subject">empowerment</field><field name="subject">development strategy</field><field name="subject">development initiatives</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340213 Economic development and growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/971</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of image quality on recall rates in a BreastScreening Program</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Masters Research -
