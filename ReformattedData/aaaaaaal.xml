The earliest clinical symptoms include episodic memory loss and dysnomia. This is followed by other signs of cortical impairment including apraxia, agnosia, and visuospatial impairment. In advanced stages, victims become mute, cannot walk and are incontinent; they therefore become totally dependent on carers. AD is the third leading cause of death in the aging population after heart disease and cancer. The incidence of AD doubles every 5 years in subjects between the ages of 65 and 85 years, affecting one in three by the age of 80. AD is characterised by the existence of intracellular and extracellular amyloid deposits in the brain. Extracellular amyloid deposits consist of plaques, whereas the deposits within and around blood vessels are referred to as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are characteristically found in AD; however, they are also found in some other neurodegenerative disorders such as tuberose sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, parkinson-dementia complex and dementia pugilistica.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease -- Animal models</field><field name="subject">Cholesterol</field><field name="subject">Oxidative stress</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's animal models</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="subject">Role of antioxidants</field><field name="subject">Role of cholesterol</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0081</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Periodic forcing of surface water-groundwater interaction : modelling in vertical section</field><field name="creator">Tony.J.Smith@csiro.au</field><field name="description">Sinusoidal variations in recharge can induce cyclical flows in surface water and groundwater. In this thesis, such time-dependent flows are explored in a coupled lakeaquifer system. The modelling extends previous steady state results and introduces new flow-visualisation techniques. Local responses in a 2D vertical section are illustrated for lakes within a 1D regional groundwater mound. The theory employs complex variables to decouple the periodic groundwater flows into separate steady state and fluctuating components.

The time dependent behaviour causes the lake-aquifer flow to change between flowthrough, recharge and discharge regimes. Corresponding fluctuations between inflow and outflow across the lakebed allow interchange of lake water with the aquifer (recycling and recapture). This also gives rise to sinuous flowpaths that can result in apparent dispersion; the number and size of waves, cusps and loops is characterised by a nondimensional waviness ratio. Streakline plots are introduced and provide an intuitive impression of the time-dependent groundwater motion. Such plots are enhanced by animation and illustrate the complex and potentially dispersive nature of the flows.

Interplay between the steady state and fluctuating responses determines the type and strength of flow regime transition. Importantly, there is an inverse relationship between head and flow in the fluctuating response. This is characterised by a dimensionless response time; a function of the aquifer geometry, hydraulic properties and period of fluctuation. During fast response, the recharge propagates mainly as fluctuation in flow, with small phase lags; particle trajectories form elliptical paths in the visualised flows. With a slower aquifer response, variation in recharge is manifest mostly as fluctuation in water level; cyclical perturbations in the flows are small and flows are nearly in steady state.

The position of a lake within the regional setting, size of the lake, and ratio of lake to aquifer recharge are important to the steady state response. Flow-through regimes occur throughout the regional setting, but dominate when the lake is lower in the system and groundwater flow is greater. Discharge and recharge regimes occur higher in the flow system, when the ratio of lake to aquifer recharge is large in magnitude.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aquifer</field><field name="subject">lake</field><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">surface water</field><field name="subject">interaction</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090617.93320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cross-cultural collaboration in New Zealand : a Chicano in Kiwi land</field><field name="creator">Franco, William</field><field name="description">In my exegesis, I will explore the different social, political, cultural and artistic themes, influences and methods that direct my art practice.

It is important that the road environment supports drivers in safe performance of the driving task. At present, increasing amounts of visual information from sources such as roadside advertising create visual clutter in the road environment. There has been little research on the effect of this visual clutter on driving performance, particularly for vulnerable groups such as novice and older drivers. The present work aims to fill this gap. Literature from a variety of relevant disciplines was surveyed and integrated, and a model of the mechanisms by which visual clutter could affect performance of the driving task was developed. To determine potential sources of clutter, focus groups with drivers were held and two studies involving subjective ratings of visual clutter in photographs and video clips of road  environments were carried out. This resulted in a taxonomy of visual clutter in the road environment: &#8216;situational clutter&#8217;, including vehicles and other road users with whom drivers interact; &#8216;designed clutter&#8217;, including road signs, signals, and markings used by traffic authorities to communicate with users; and &#8216;built clutter&#8217;, including roadside development and any signage not originating from a road authority. The taxonomy of visual clutter was tested using the change detection paradigm. Drivers were slower to detect changes in photographs of road scenes with high levels of visual clutter than with low levels, and slower for road scenes including advertising billboards than road scenes without billboards. Finally, the effects of billboard presence and lead vehicles on vehicle control, eye movements and responses to traffic signs and signals were tested using a driving simulator. The number of vehicles included appeared to be insufficient to create situational clutter. However billboards had significant effects on driver speed (slower), ability to follow directions on road signs (slower with more errors), and eye movements (increased amount of time fixating on roadsides at the expense of scanning the road ahead). Older drivers were particularly affected by visual clutter in both the change detection and simulated driving tasks. Results are discussed in terms of implications for future research and for road safety practitioners. Visual clutter can affect driver workload as well as purely visual aspects of the driving task (such as hazard perception and search for road signs). When driver workload is increased past a certain point other driving tasks will also be performed less well (such as speed maintenance). Advertising billboards in particular cause visual distraction, and should be considered at a similar level of potential danger as visual distraction from in-vehicle devices. The consequences of roadside visual clutter are more severe for the growing demographic of older drivers. Currently, road environments do not support drivers (particularly older drivers) as well as they could. Based on the results, guidance is given for road authorities to improve this status when designing and location road signage and approving roadside advertising.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Road safety</field><field name="subject">Driving simulator</field><field name="subject">Cognitive workload</field><field name="subject">Roadside advertising</field><field name="subject">Billboard</field><field name="subject">Road signs</field><field name="subject">Novice drivers</field><field name="subject">Older drivers</field><field name="subject">Change detection</field><field name="subject">Visual perception</field><field name="subject">Information processing</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/64951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The other basic aspect of reality.</field><field name="creator">Floth, Simon, History and Philosophy, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">It is argued that physical (and not inherently psychical) properties are insufficient to constitute all else.  Specifically they cannot constitute an instance (K1) of our knowledge that the number of existing things is at least one.   This employs a new version of entry by entailment:  Every fact as to the presence of a constituted trope is entailed by facts about the presence of the ontologically basic, where a property is ontologically basic if and only if the fact of its presence is not entailed (even allowing exhaustive definitions of all tropes in terms of their ultimate constituents) by facts about the presence of things non-identical to it. Existence is a mind-independent presence.  Things can be present (to mind) as opposed to existing but must be accompanied by the presence of all of their parts and of anything else that their presence might entail.  This includes some existing thing in the case that knowledge that something exists is present, since it is analytic that knowledge cannot be of what is not the case. Purely dynamical properties cannot exist apart from instances of some other property kind (on pain of regress as to what moves).  Material properties can make a difference to cognitive states only in virtue of differences they can make to dynamical properties.  Thus, any cognitive state present in some dynamical and material scenario must be present in an equivalent purely dynamical scenario, which cannot exist. Hence:  1) There can be no knowledge of existence, or thus trope K1, in a purely dynamical scenario.  2) There can thus neither be a trope K1 if only dynamical and material properties (and what they constitute) are present.  So because there is a trope K1, there are one or more ontologically basic properties which are not dynamical or material.  It is further argued that nothing ontologically basic is per se (directly and non-obscurely) conceivable except as psychicality or a categorical basis of a disposition to change or constancy (respectively, dynamism and materiality).   Thus at least one ontologically basic property is either psychical or not per se conceivable.  The latter proposition has less merit.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Consciousness.</field><field name="subject">Qualia.</field><field name="subject">Metaphysics.</field><field name="subject">Mind.</field><field name="subject">Psychoanalysis.</field><field name="subject">Reality.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31864</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive load theory and mathematics education</field><field name="creator">Khateeb, Majeda, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cognitive load theory uses the immense size of human long-term memory and the significantly limited capacity of working memory to design instructional methods. Five basic principles: information store principle, borrowing and reorganizing principle, randomness as genesis principle, narrow limits of change principle, and environmental linking and organizing principle explain the cognitive basics of this theory.  The theory differentiates between three major types of cognitive load: extraneous load that is caused by instructional strategies, intrinsic cognitive load that results from a high element interactivity material and germane load that is concerned with activities leading to learning. Instructional methods designed in accordance with cognitive load theory rely heavily on the borrowing and reorganizing principle, rather than on the randomness as genesis principle to reduce the imposed cognitive load. As learning fractions incorporates high element interactivity, a high intrinsic cognitive load is imposed. Therefore, learning fractions was studied in the experiments of this thesis.  Knowledge held in long-term memory can be used to reduce working memory load via the environmental linking and organizing principle. It can be suggested that if fractions are presented using familiar objects, many of the interacting elements that constitute a fraction might be embedded in stored knowledge and so can be treated as a single element by working memory. Thus, familiar context can be used to reduce cognitive load and so facilitate learning.  In a series of randomized, controlled experiments, evidence was found to argue for a contextual effect. The first three experiments of this thesis were designed to test the main hypothesis that presenting students with worked examples concerning fractions would enhance learning if a real-life context was used rather than a geometric context. This hypothesis was tested using both a visual and a word-based format and was supported by the results.  The last two experiments were intended to test the context effect using either worked examples or problem solving. The results supported the validity of the previous hypothesis using both instructional methods.  Overall, the thesis sheds some light on the advantages of using familiar objects when mastering complex concepts in mathematics.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Context effect</field><field name="subject">Cognitive Load Theory</field><field name="subject">Mathematics education</field><field name="subject">Instructional techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An XML-based framework for electronic business document integration with relational databases</field><field name="creator">Shamsedin Tekieh, Razieh Sadat, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are becoming  increasingly  engaged in  B2B interactions. The ubiquitousness of the Internet and the quasi-reliance on electronic  document exchanges with larger trading partners have fostered this move. The main  technical challenge that this brings to SMEs is that of business document integration:  they  need  to  exchange  business  documents  with  heterogeneous  document  formats and also integrate these documents with internal information systems. Often they can not  afford  using  expensive,  customized  and  proprietary  solutions  for  document exchange and storage. Rather they need cost-effective approaches designed based on open standards and backed with easy-to-use information systems.  In this dissertation, we investigate the problem of business document integration for  SMEs  following  a  design  science  methodology.  We  propose  a  framework  and conceptual  architecture  for  a  business  document  integration  system  (BDIS).  By  studying existing business document formats, we recommend using the  GS1 XML standard  format  as  the  intermediate  format  for  business  documents  in  BDIS.  The GS1 standards are widely used in supply chains and logistics globally.  We present an architecture for BDIS consisting of two layers: one for the design of internal information system based on relational databases, capable of storing XML business documents, and the other enabling the exchange of heterogeneous business documents  at  runtime.  For  the  design  layer,  we  leverage  existing  XML  schema conversion  approaches,  and  extend  them,  to  propose  a  customized  and  novel approach for converting GS1 XML document schemas into relational schemas. For the runtime  layer,  we  propose  wrappers  as  architectural  components  for  the conversion of various electronic documents formats into the GS1 XML format.  We demonstrate our approach through a case study involving a GS1 XML business document.  We  have  implemented  a  prototype  BDIS.  We  have  evaluated  and compared  it  with  existing  research  and  commercial  tools  for  XML  to  relational schema  conversion.  The  results  show  that  it  generates  operational  and  simpler relational schemas for GS1 XML documents. In conclusion, the proposed framework enables SMEs to engage effectively in electronic business.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SMEs.</field><field name="subject">B2B integration.</field><field name="subject">XML schema.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cognitive load approach to instruction in formation of algebraic equations</field><field name="creator">Pawley, Duncan Medway, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">In a series of five experiments, the effectiveness of using worked examples to teach grade 8 and 9 students the process of translating a written sentence into an algebraic equation, was examined from a cognitive load perspective. The first experiment compared the use of worked examples with a problemsolving strategy. Both for higher and lower levels of prior knowledge in mathematics, the worked examples format group performed significantly better than the problemsolving group. In experiment 2 the worked examples format was compared with an ??algorithm?? method for teaching students to write equations. No significant differences were found in performance on similar questions at either the higher or the lower levels of prior knowledge. However, for transfer questions and questions testing understanding, the performance of the worked examples format was significantly better than that of the algorithm format for the higher level of prior knowledge, though differences were not significant for the lower level. In experiment 3 worked examples using two different methods of checking the translation, the ??comparison?? method and the ??substitution?? method, were compared. No significant differences were found between the two methods for either knowledge group. In experiments 4 and 5 it was shown that grade 8 and 9 students were initially disadvantaged by the inclusion of a checking method. However, after a more substantial period of acquisition, for the students with a lower level of prior knowledge, those who received checking instructions performed significantly better than did those who did not receive such instructions. In contrast, higher knowledge students were continually disadvantaged by the inclusion of a checking method. Higher knowledge students receiving checking instructions experienced a significantly higher cognitive load than did those not receiving them, as shown by a measure of mental effort. The positive effect of checking for lower knowledge students and the negative effect for higher knowledge students in this domain is a further example of the expertise reversal effect. Evidence was found that the inclusion of checking instructions led to a redundancy effect for higher knowledge learners and caused retroactive inhibition for all learners.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Equations</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching (Secondary)</field><field name="subject">Cognitive learning theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20494</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of exercise and the exercise setting on older women???s self-concept</field><field name="creator">Dickman, Nancy Margaret, School of Health &amp; Sports Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the effect of exercise and the exercise setting on self-concept in the context of older women. Very little research in this area has focused on older women. At the same time it attempted to identify possible mechanisms underpinning exercise-induced change in self-concept, including the effect of the group and change in real and perceived body condition and real and perceived fitness. Adherence issues and the hierarchical structure of self-concept were examined in an exploratory manner. An extensive literature review was undertaken. It concluded with a preliminary exercise-self-concept model which would be used to explain and evaluate the thesis??? hypotheses. Two studies were undertaken. Study 1 validated the English version of the Self-perception in Exercise Questionnaire (SPEQ) (Sorensen, 1999) and examined relationships between exercise status, age, body size, and physical self-perceptions in a sample of older Australian women. The SPEQ was found to be a valid and reliable instrument to be used in Study 2 to measure self-perceptions relevant to exercise in older Australian women. Study 2, a randomised controlled trial, examined the effect of exercise and the exercise setting on older women???s self-concept. It comprises the main body of work for this thesis. It compared a group of older women exercising together in a group to a similar group of women who performed exactly the same exercise alone. Then both groups were compared to a similarly motivated group of women who did not exercise, but were waiting to start an exercise program. Using a pre-posttest design it measured exercise-induced change in self-concept, selfperceptions, satisfaction, and 13 physiological measures. Following a 12-week exercise treatment, the older women who walked regularly either alone or in a group thrice weekly experienced significantly improved total, physical, and social self-concept, more positive perceptions of their body and fitness, increased satisfaction with self and with life in general, and improved aerobic fitness compared to controls. When the three experimental conditions were compared, however, these outcomes were significant only for group exercise compared to controls; not for alone exercise compared to controls. Of greater importance, when the two exercise settings, walk alone and walk in a group, were compared, the women who walked in a group experienced significantly improved physical self-concept, satisfaction with life, and more positive perceptions of their body and fitness compared to the women who walked alone. Unexpectedly, aerobic fitness also increased significantly for the women who walked in a group relative to controls, but not for the alone walk condition. Taken together these findings suggest group exercise offers considerable psychological and aerobic fitness benefits to older women. These are valuable and unique findings. They are reinforced by the high adherence (91%) and participation rates (95%) achieved in the walk trial. Partial support was found for the proposed exercise-self-concept model and the hierarchical structure of self-concept was demonstrated. Perceived change accounted for more of the variance in self-concept than real body and fitness change. Effect sizes were larger for certain physical self-perceptions than for global self-concept. In conclusion, this thesis has extended current knowledge of exercise effects on selfconcept to older women, added a systematic exercise-self-concept review, added a useful instrument for measuring older women???s self-perceptions in exercise in future studies, and added to current knowledge of mechanisms underpinning improved self-concept following exercise. Exercise, moderate-intensity walking, was found to positively and significantly affect older women???s self-concept. The exercise setting differentially affected older women???s selfconcept; effects were significantly greater when the exercise was performed in a group with similar others. The group exercise setting and its effect on self-perceptions is suggested as a possible mechanism underpinning the positive exercise-self-concept association.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older women</field><field name="subject">exercise.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interocular interactions in normal and amblyopic visual systems</field><field name="creator">Vedamurthy, Indu, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to add to our understanding of interocular interactions in normally sighted children (Group I, N=20), normal adults (Group II, N=20) and adults with anisometropic amblyopia (N=12) by investigating responses to a range of visual functions under three kinds of viewing condition. Visual functions tested were visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and alignment sensitivity.  Stimuli were generated on a Cambridge VSG card driving a high resolution monitor and FE liquid crystal goggles, enabling three kinds of viewing conditions:  1.	Monocular (non-tested eye occluded), used as a baseline for most functions.  2.	Dichoptic (uniform field presented to the non-tested eye but with a binocular fusion lock).  3.	Binocular. In general, binocular performance was better than monocular (binocular summation) but so too was dichoptic performance (dichoptic advantage).   However there was much variation within individuals (the three functions showing different summation/advantage pattern) and between individuals. Significant conclusions include:  (a)	Maturational windows for interocular interactions differ for different spatial visual functions. (b)	Interpretations of results from one visual function cannot be applied automatically to other functions.

Its administration and operation within UN development discourse has not been explored previously in academic analysis. This thesis explores this rich archive of development discourse. It seeks to situate the LDC category as a vehicle that both produces and is a product of  development discourse, and uses gender analysis as a critical tool to identify the ways in which the LDC category discourse operates. The thesis draws on Foucauldian theory to develop and use the  concept &#145;technologies of knowledge&#146;, which places the dynamics of LDC discourse into relief. Three technologies of knowledge are identified: LDC  policy, classification through criteria, and data. The ways each of these technologies of knowledge operates are explored through detailed readings of over thirty years of UN policy documents that form the thesis&#146;s primary source material. A central question within this thesis is: If the majority of the world&#146;s poor are women, where are the women in the policy about the countries that are the poorest of the poor? In focusing the analysis on the representation of women in LDCs, I place women at the centre of the analytic stage, as opposed to the marginal position I have found they occupy  within LDC discourse. Through this analysis of the
reductionist representations of LDC women, I  explore the gendered dynamics of development discourse.
Exploring the operation of these three  technologies of knowledge reveals some of the discursive boundaries of UN LDC category  discourse, particularly through its inability to  incorporate gender analysis. The discussion of these three technologies of knowledge &#150; policy, classification through criteria, and data &#150; is framed by discussions of development and gender. The discussion on development positions this analysis within post-development critiques of  development policy, practice and theory. The discussion on gender positions this analysis within the trajectory of postmodern and  postcolonial influenced feminist engagements with development as a theory and praxis, particularly with debates about the representation of women
in the third world. This case study of the  operation of development discourse usefully highlights gendered dynamics of discursive ways of knowing.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Development discourse</field><field name="subject">United Nations</field><field name="subject">Postcolonial</field><field name="subject">Postmodern</field><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="subject">Least Developed Country Policy</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Feminism</field><field name="subject">Poverty</field><field name="subject">Gender Analysis</field><field name="subject">LDC</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070619.123607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental investigation of erosion in variably saturated clay soils</field><field name="creator">Lim, Seok San, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The erosion behaviour of clay soils has been investigated through a comprehensive program of laboratory testing. Three different erosion test methods have been employed including the rotating cylinder test (RCT), the hole erosion test (HET), and the slaking test (SLT). A new rotating cylinder test device is designed and manufactured capable of testing disturbed and undisturbed soil samples in saturated and unsaturated states. Details of the equipment along with its calibration, testing and sampling procedures are provided. The HET has been reviewed and modified to provide consistent test results. In addition, the slaking test has been customised to accept samples identical to those used in the RCT. A total 111 RCT, 139 HET, and 108 slaking tests have been conducted and analysed. Typical shapes of the erosion curves are identified, based on a wide range of shear stresses and erosion rates analysed. Correlations are presented between the RCT and HET, and between the RCT and SLT to allow characterisation of clay soil erosion in a consistent and unified manner. The erosion modes of clay soils are investigated and categorised into three main groups: ???dispersive erosion???, ???saturated non-dispersive erosion???, and ???unsaturated non-dispersive erosion???. It is shown that soils falling in the same category exhibit near identical erosion characteristics. Factors affecting clay soil erodibility are investigated and displayed for each erosion mode. All findings are presented in a unified framework.

To achieve the capacities of MIMO channels, MIMO bit-interleaved-coded-modulation (BICM) systems with iterative detection and decod- ing (IDD) are studied in this thesis. The research for this dissertation is conducted based on the iterative receivers with convolutional codes and turbo codes. A variety of MIMO detectors, such as a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) detector, a list sphere detector (LSD) and a parallel interference canceller (PIC) together with a decision statistic combiner (DSC), are studied. The performance of these iterative receivers is investigated via bounding techniques or Monte-Carlos simulations. Moreover, the computational complexities of the components are quantified and compared. The convergence behaviors of the iterative receivers are analyzed via variance trans- fer (VTR) functions and variance exchange graphs (VEGs). The analysis of conver- gence behavior facilitates the finding of components with good matching. For a fast fading channel, we show that the &amp;quotwaterfall region&amp;quot of an iterative receiver can be predicted by VEG. For a slow fading channel, it is shown that the performance of an iterative receiver is essentially limited by the early interception ratio (ECR) which is obtained via simulations. After the transfer properties of the detectors are unveiled, a detection switching (DSW) methodology is proposed and the switching criterion based on cross entropy (CE) is derived. By employing DSW, the performance of an iterative receiver with a list sphere detector (LSD) of a small list size is considerably improved. It is shown that the iterative receiver achieves a performance very close to that with a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) detector but with a significantly reduced complexity. For an iterative receiver with more than two components, various iteration sched- ules are explored. The schedules are applied in an iterative receiver with PIC-DSC. It is shown that the iterative receiver with a periodic scheduling outperforms that with the conventional scheduling at the same level of complexity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MIMO systems</field><field name="subject">Signal processing</field><field name="subject">Iterative methods (Mathematics)</field><field name="subject">Coding theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A pragmatic approach to area coverage in hybrid wireless sensor networks</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Nadeem, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Success of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) largely depends on whether the deployed network can provide desired area coverage with acceptable network lifetime. In hostile or harsh environments such as enemy territories in battlefields, fire or chemical spills, it is impossible to deploy the sensor nodes in a predeter- mined regular topology to guarantee adequate coverage. Random deployment is thus more practical and feasible for large target areas. On the other hand, random deployment of sensors is highly susceptible to the occurrence of coverage holes in the target area. A potential solution for enhancing the existing coverage achieved by random deployments involves the use of mobility capable sensors that would help fill the coverage holes. This thesis seeks to address the problem of determining the current coverage achieved by the non-deterministic deployment of static sensor nodes and subsequently enhancing the coverage using mobile sensors.  The main contributions of this dissertation are the design and evaluation of MAPC (Mobility Assisted Probabilistic Coverage), a distributed protocol for ensuring area coverage in hybrid wireless sensor networks. The primary contribution is a pragmatic approach to sensor coverage and maintenance that we hope would lower the technical barriers to its field deployment. Most of the assumptions made in the MAPC protocol are realistic and implementable in real-life applications e.g., practical boundary estimation, coverage calculations based on a realistic sensing model, and use of movement triggering thresholds based on real radio characteristics etc. The MAPC is a comprehensive three phase protocol. In the first phase, the static sensors calculate the area coverage using the Probabilistic Coverage Algorithm (PCA). This is a deviation from the idealistic assumption used in the binary detection model, wherein a sensor can sense accurately within a well defined (usually circular) region. Static sensors execute the PCA algorithm, in a distributed way, to identify any holes in the coverage. In the second phase, MAPC scheme moves the mobile nodes in an optimal manner to fill these uncovered locations. For different types of initial deployments, the proposed movement algorithms consume only 30-40% of the energy consumed by the basic virtual force algorithm. In addition, this thesis addresses the problem of coverage loss due to damaged and energy depleted nodes. The problem has been formulated as an Integer Linear Program and implementable heuristics are developed that perform close to optimal solutions. By replacing in-operational nodes in phase three, MAPC scheme ensures the continuous operation of the WSN.  Experiments with real mote hardware were conducted to validate the boundary and coverage estimation part of the MAPC protocol. Extensive discrete event simulations (using NS2) were also performed for the complete MAPC protocol and the results demonstrate that MAPC can enhance and maintain the area coverage by efficiently moving mobile sensor nodes to strategic positions in the uncovered area.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coverage Issues.</field><field name="subject">Wireless sensor networks.</field><field name="subject">Computer networks.</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The nature of error, error detection and automaticity in skilled behaviour</field><field name="creator">Baker, Troy Andrew, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This series of research attempted to clarify a number of issues relating to highly skilled performance including the frequency and nature of errors, the error detection capabilities and the purported role of automaticity in the production of skilled behaviour. The first study applied Rasmussen???s (1980) skill-, rule- and knowledge-based behaviour taxonomy to examine the frequency and nature of errors in skilled and highly skilled behaviour. Results provided an estimate of the frequency of skill-based errors, which has been unavailable in previous diary studies. A significantly lower proportion of skill-based errors were reported by elite compared with recreational golfers, suggesting that a characteristic of highly skilled behaviour is a reduction in the tendency toward minimal levels of cognitive control exhibited in everyday tasks and by those of lesser skill. In order to establish the level of insight skilled performers have into their actions, the second study manipulated visual feedback to examine the detection of error in elite and recreational golfers. Results indicated that an increase in skill was associated with an increase in the ability to detect error, however the error detection capability of elite players was far from perfect with fewer than 60% of marginal errors detected. Visual confirmation of the outcome is apparently necessary for precise error detection even in highly skilled golfers. In addition, both elite and recreational golfers attributed errors to poor concentration, yet this result appeared to be dependent upon observation of the error. Elite and recreational golfers reported attending to cues relating to the target, rhythm and technique during execution of the golf swing. The final series of experiments examined the effect of a sudden irrelevant sound on the performance of elite and recreational golfers. The first phase of this series of experiments demonstrated that an irrelevant sound occurring during the golf swing could disrupt the performance of elite and recreational players. The second experiment suggested that, in elite golfers, the disruption of performance was most likely an orienting response to the sudden noise. The results of these studies suggest that although attentional resources become available with the progression to skilled behaviour, even a highly proceduralised movement sequence, such as the golf swing, never becomes completely resource free. The final experiment suggested that increasing the attentional engagement of elite golfers could attenuate the negative impact of a sudden irrelevant sound on performance. Whilst there is no question of a tendency towards automaticity with extended practice, overall the research questions the proposition that highly skilled behaviour is characterised by a literal interpretation of automaticity, either in the planning or execution of movement, or in relation to error detection.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">errors</field><field name="subject">golf</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Do Patent Systems Improve Economic Well-Being?  An Exploration of the Inventiveness of Business Method Patents</field><field name="creator">Moir, Hazel Veronica Jane</field><field name="description">The reach of the patent system has substantially broadened in recent decades. Subject matter extensions were not introduced by parliaments, but by individual judges considering specific cases, often between private parties. The focus in this thesis is whether these changes create a net economic benefit to society. Because of the lack of data on patents, it is not possible to address this question directly. The thesis therefore focuses on a critical aspect of patents: their inventiveness.&#182;

The main contribution of this thesis is a detailed empirical assessment of the inventiveness of patents. This assessment breaks new ground by using the actual claims in the patent specification as the basis for a qualitative assessment against the yardstick of whether there is any new contribution to knowledge. This yardstick is used because a key social benefit from private invention is the spillovers from new knowledge. In addition a low inventive threshold encourages monopoly grants for inventions that would have occurred absent patents, and thus increases social costs without any offsetting benefits.&#182;

A small universe of 72 recently granted Australian business method patents is assessed on this basis. Of these, one possibly contributes new knowledge, and three others possibly contribute new ideas, but without any associated new knowledge. It is hard to find any contribution in the rest of the dataset. The data suggest that the large majority of currently granted patents produce no benefit to society, and do not meet the normal definition of the concept of &#147;invention&#148;.&#182;

The detailed analysis shows the underlying problems to include identifying previous knowledge, an issue already suggested by the literature, but more extensively documented here. The legal judgement rules developed through case law are shown to be very poor yardsticks for implementation of an important economic policy. The narrow legal doctrines result in, for example, the computerisation of well-known methods being judged both novel and inventive. They also allow obvious combinations of old ideas, and trivial variations on old ideas to be granted patent monopolies. Despite the analogous use doctrine, patents are granted for the application of known methods to new areas for which they are well suited.&#182; 

A number of proposals are put forward for reform of patent policy. The underlying theme is that there should be a good chance, and clear evidence, that the patent system enhances national economic well-being. Specific proposals include writing the objective of patent policy into the statute so that judges have clear guidance in their decision-making, limiting the grant of patents to science and technology based inventions, requiring the patent applicant to demonstrate novelty and inventiveness beyond reasonable doubt, setting the inventiveness standard in the context of a balance between benefits and costs, and introducing a defence of independent invention.&#182;

As the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) mandates no discrimination under patent law between fields of technology, the results of this investigation may be generalisable to other technology fields. They may also be generalisable to the inventiveness standards in other jurisdictions: of the 72 Australian patents, 32 have already received at least one overseas grant (18 if New Zealand is excluded).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">patent monopolies; economic assessment of patent monopolies; height of the inventive step; business method patents</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090621.135115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crossing the channel : socio-cultural exchanges in English and French women's writings - 1830-1900</field><field name="creator">Pauk Filgueira, Barbara</field><field name="description">The focus of this study is an investigation of cross-channel exchanges represented in travelogues, historical works, journalism, letters and journals written by English women Frances Trollope, Lady Margaret Blessington, George Eliot and Julia Kavanagh on France and by French women Flora Tristan and Marie Dronsart on England. The work is based on the view that narratives about another culture betray preconceptions and beliefs and are never innocent descriptions. Nineteenth-century English descriptions of France, for instance, are not only marked by the stereotype of the gregarious French bon vivant but also by the often tense political relationship and economical concurrence between the two countries. French descriptions of England reflect the consciousness of England's superiority in the domains of economy, industry and colonialism as well as the stereotype of the boring, monosyllabic, haughty, egoistic and often xenophobic Englishman. Given that writings on the other culture are marked by practices and belief systems as well as notions of superiority and inferiority like texts emerging from a colonial context, ideas which have been developed in this field by scholars such as Sara Mills and Reina Lewis have been used as a basis for this investigation. I argue that the women whose texts I analyse strategically employ 'discourses of difference' (to use Sara Mills' term), or alignment and 'othering' in regard to nation, class, and political opinion, in order to gain positions which allow them to challenge contemporary ideologies of femininity. They take advantage of their positions in very different ways, according to their personal, class and economic situations, their agenda, and their gendered position within society which changes significantly during the century. The English women Frances Trollope, Lady Margaret Blessington, George Eliot and Julia Kavanagh construct themselves as part of the tradition of French salonni&#232;res from the seventeenth century to the present, while the French women Flora Tristan and Marie Dronsart align themselves with English travel writers, particularly Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Through a careful construction of these foremothers, which often differed from other representations of them, they criticise gender politics in their own country and endeavour to normalise their own activities as intellectuals and writers, in the case of Tristan as a socialist and feminist activist. This strategy is complemented by 'othering' with regard to nation, class and political convictions which confers on the women an authoritative authorial voice and / or allows them to support their argument. They endorse ideologies of gender, nation and class at the same time as they reject some aspects of them. This study reveals new aspects of nineteenth-century discussions of the so-called 'woman question' through a broader approach which encompasses not only the parameters of gender, class and political orientation but also cross-cultural experience.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">French</field><field name="subject">Women authors, English -- 19th century</field><field name="subject">Women authors, French -- 19th century</field><field name="subject">England -- In literature</field><field name="subject">France -- In literature</field><field name="subject">England -- Social life and customs -- 19th century</field><field name="subject">France -- Social life and customs -- 19th century</field><field name="subject">National characteristics</field><field name="subject">Cross-cultural exchanges</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">English</field><field name="subject">Trollope</field><field name="subject">Blessington</field><field name="subject">Eliot</field><field name="subject">Kavanagh</field><field name="subject">Dronsar</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0083</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the monocyte-derived cell populations of the uveal tract and retina in homeostatic conditions and during the early stages of ocular autoimmune disease</field><field name="creator">Kezic, Jelena Marie</field><field name="description">The eye contains closely related but widely different tissues, offering a unique opportunity to investigate the phenotype and function of monocyte-derived cell populations within functionally unique microenvironments in a single complex organ. The uveal tract and retina contain rich networks of immune cells that reside and traffic through the eye, these cells having been implicated in various ocular inflammatory processes and immune-mediated diseases. One such inflammatory condition is human posterior uveitis, an autoimmune disease mainly affecting the retina. As current treatments for posterior uveitis only serve to slow down disease progression, studies using animal models, namely, experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), have focused on determining the key cellular and molecular mediators involved in disease initiation in order to expand the potential for novel therapeutic applications. The overall purpose of experiments in this thesis was to explore monocyte-derived cell populations of the uveal tract and retina, this being achieved by utilising a novel transgenic mouse model. Cx3cr1gfp/gfp transgenic mice on both BALB/c and C57Bl/6 backgrounds contain an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) encoding cassette knocked into the Cx3cr1 gene, disrupting its expression but facilitating GFP expression under the control of the Cx3cr1 promoter. Heterozygous (Cx3cr1+/gfp) mice were generated by crossing Cx3cr1gfp/gfp mice to wild-type (WT) mice. This transgenic model allowed for the exquisite visualisation of Cx3cr1-bearing monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages in ocular tissues, whilst also enabling the investigation of a potential role for Cx3cr1 in recruiting monocyte-derived cells to the eye in steady-state and inflammatory conditions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anterior segment (Eye) -- Diseases -- Animal models</field><field name="subject">Uveitis -- Animal models</field><field name="subject">Retina -- Diseases -- Animal models</field><field name="subject">Transgenic mice</field><field name="subject">Autoimmunity</field><field name="subject">Macrophages</field><field name="subject">Uveal tract</field><field name="subject">Retina</field><field name="subject">Microglia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0084</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soft systems analysis of ecosystems</field><field name="creator">Shanmuganathan, Subana</field><field name="description">This research is a case study evaluation of the use of self-organising map (SOM) techniques for ecosystem modelling to overcome the perceived inadequacies with conventional ecological data analysis methods. SOMs provide an analytical method within the connectionist paradigms of artificial neural networks (ANNs), developed from concepts that evolved from late twentieth century neuro-physiological experiments on the cortex cells of the human brain.  The rate and extent at which humans influence environmental deterioration with commensurate biodiversity loss is a cause for major concern and to prevent further degradation by human impact, parsimonious models are urgently needed.  Indeed, the need for better modelling techniques has never been so great.  Ecologists and many national and international bodies see the situation as 'significantly critical' for the conservation of our global ecosystem to foster the continued wellbeing of humanity on this earth.The thesis investigates and further refines SOM based exploratory data analysis methods for modelling naturally evolving, highly diverse and extremely complex ecosystems. Earlier studies provide evidence on SOM ability to analyse complex forest and freshwater biological community structures at limited scales.  On the other hand, growing concerns over conventional methods, their soundness and ability to model large volumes of data are seen as of little use, leading to arguments on the results derived from them. Case study chapters illustrate how SOM methods could be best applied to analyse often 'cryptic' ecosystems in a manner similar to that applied in modelling highly complex and diverse industrial system dynamics.  Furthermore, SOM based data clustering methods, used for financial data analysis are investigated for integrated analysis of ecological and economic system data to study the effects of urbanisation on natural habitats.SOM approaches prove to be an excellent tool for analysing the changes within physical system variables and their effects on the biological systems analysed.  The Long Bay-Okura Marine Reserve case study elaborates on how SOM based approaches could be best applied to model the reserve's intertidal zone with available numeric data.  SOM maps depicted the characteristic microclimate within this zone from ecological monitoring data of physical attributes, without any geographical data being added.  This kind of feature extraction from raw data is found to be useful and is applied to two more case studies to study the slow variables of ecosystems, such as population dynamics, and to establish their correlation with environmental variations.   SOM maps are found to be capable of distinguishing the human induced variations from that of natural/ global variations, at different scales (site, regional and global) and levels using regional and global data.  Hence, SOM approaches prove to be capable of modelling complex natural systems incorporating their spatial and temporal variations using the available monitoring data, this is a major advantage observed with SOM analyses.In the third case study, potential use of SOM techniques to analyse global trends on the effects of urbanisation in environmental and biological systems are explored using the World Bank's statistical data for different countries.  Many state and international institutions, concerned over global environmental issues, have made attempts to develop indicators to assess the conditions of different ecosystems.  The enhancements with SOM approaches against the currently recommended indicator system based on information pyramid and pressure-state-response (PSR) models are elaborated upon.The research results of SOM methods for ecosystem modelling, similar to that applied to industrial process modelling and financial system analysis show potential. SOM approaches (i.e. cluster, dependent component, decision system and trajectories/ time series analyses) provide a means for feature extraction from the available numeric data at different levels and scales, fulfilling the urgent need for modelling tools to conserve our global ecosystem.  They can be used to bridge the gap in converting raw data into knowledge to inform sustainable ecosystem management.  Increasingly, traditional methods based on Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) designs and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) are seen to be unsuitable for ecological data analysis, as they are unable to detect human induced environmental impacts from that of a natural cause.  This thesis proves that SOM techniques could be applied to modelling not only a natural systems complexity but also its functioning and dynamics, incorporating spatial as well as temporal variations, to overcome the constraints with conventional methods as applied in other stated disciplines.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biotic communities</field><field name="subject">Ecosystem management</field><field name="subject">Classification</field><field name="subject">Enviornmental studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intellectual capital reporting in New Zealand: refining content analysis as a research method</field><field name="creator">Steenkamp, Natasja</field><field name="description">This study examines voluntary intellectual capital reporting (ICR) in New Zealand firms' annual reports, with a view to contributing to understanding ICR practice. This study also reflects on content analysis with a view to refining the methodology when applied to investigating ICR.The literature includes widespread claims that intellectual capital (IC) resources are important value drivers and assets, and that IC information should be reported externally. However, complexities relating to identifying IC prevent it from being recognised as an asset under current accounting regulations. Consequently, the traditional financial reporting system is being criticised as out-of-date, giving deficient and irrelevant information, and having lost its value relevance. Numerous scholars have investigated voluntary ICR in several countries, but have presented different results and findings. The literature argues that the results of many ICR studies cannot be meaningfully compared because inconsistent data collection instruments have been applied. To advance ICR research, further refining and developing of the methodology is advocated; problems relating to applying methodological issues need to be resolved. Moreover, to establish consensus about ICR, more research and evidence is needed concerning exactly what and how IC is reported.The 2004 annual reports of the 30 largest (by market capitalisation) New Zealand firms listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange were analysed. Content analysis was applied to determine what and how IC is reported. Inferences about what IC is communicated were made based on an analysis of the content of texts and visual representations. To determine how IC is reported, voluntary reporting was categorised according to the form, nature and location of the disclosure. Frequencies of mention were recorded. Hence, each incidence of occurrence was coded and counted.This study reflected on content analysis methodology by searching the literature for guidance on how to apply this approach and how to deal with the challenges and problems it poses. The thesis discusses methodological issues that could be applied differently, and hence hinder the replicability and comparability of ICR studies. Moreover, the ICR literature provided limited guidance about how to deal with methodological challenges and problems, and revealed an absence of explicit recording instructions. Therefore, explicating this study's recording instructions should enhance replicability and comparability of future ICR research and hence further refine the methodology.Some results of this content analysis study disconfirm those of prior research: New Zealand firms show high levels of ICR, the most reported IC category is human capital, and the most reported IC item is employees. In line with prior research, this study showed that most ICR is presented in declarative terms. Moreover, more than one-third of New Zealand firms' ICR is disclosed as pictures. This indicates the importance of pictorial information as a means of reporting IC and the need to include graphics when conducting ICR research. This study's findings also indicate a narrative approach, similar to the European notion of story telling, to voluntarily report IC information. This approach suggests that narratives have possible potential for voluntary ICR, as an approach that departs from a measurement and quantification approach.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intellectual capital reporting</field><field name="subject">ICR studies</field><field name="subject">Voluntary reporting</field><field name="subject">Accounting regulations - New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Content analysis methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of simulated altitude exposure on sea level performance</field><field name="creator">Hinckson, Erica</field><field name="description">Exposure to natural altitude using the "live high-train low" method improves athletic endurance performance at sea level by 1-2%. This method can also be employed with hypoxic devices that simulate altitude, but there is limited and conflicting research on their efficacy. Consequently, three studies were undertaken to investigate changes in sea level performance of endurance runners following exposure to altitude simulated with hypoxic tents. The device was chosen because of its potential for incorporation into the athlete's routine. In Study 1, 10 runners received altitude simulated with hypoxic tents (~9 h overnight at 2500-3500 m) and trained at sea level, while 10 runners in the control group performed usual training. Athletes in both groups performed a lactate-threshold test, but only the altitude group performed a run to exhaustion. The effect on  4-mM lactate speed was unclear, owing to poor reliability of this measure. There was a 16% increase in time to exhaustion in the hypoxic conditioning group, equivalent to a 1.9% (90% likely limits, &#177;1.4%) increase in speed in a time trial. Effects on performance were not apparent four and eight weeks after use of the tents. To improve precision of the effect of the tents and to determine the effects on performance of different durations, a further controlled trial was performed. A reliability study (Study 2) was first conducted to investigate the potential for runs to exhaustion to provide reliable measures of performance. Eight runners performed a test consisting of three runs to exhaustion lasting ~2, ~4 and ~8 min on six occasions over 14 wk. The critical power and log-log models were used to provide factors for converting variability in time to exhaustion into variability in equivalent time-trial time. Variabilities in time to exhaustion expressed as coefficients of variation for predicted 800-3000 m timetrial times were ~1-3%. A crossover study (Study 3) was then conducted in which 11 athletes performed usual (control) training and usual training with altitude exposure by using tents for 25 &#177; 3 days (mean &#177; SD) for 8.1 &#177; 0.6 h.d-1, progressing from a simulated altitude of 2500 m to 3500 m above sea level. Washout period between control and altitude treatments was four weeks. Performance was assessed with treadmill runs to exhaustion as in Study 2. Improvements in mean predicted times (altitude-control) for standard competition distances of 800, 1500 and 3000 m derived from the runs to exhaustion were 1.0% (&#177;1.3%), 1.4% (&#177;1.2%) and 1.9% (&#177;1.5%) respectively. There was some evidence that hypoxic exposure favoured those athletes carrying the I allele for angiotensin converting enzyme. In summary, the main finding from the series of studies is that hypoxic tents are likely to enhance sea level endurance running performance by ~1-2%.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Altitude, Influence of</field><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Exercise science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inclusive education a decade after democratisation: the educational needs of children with disabilities in KwaZulu-Natal</field><field name="creator">Maher, Marguerite</field><field name="description">Commitment to a single, inclusive education system has been the aspiration of reform in education in a democratic South Africa. The dilemma facing the democratically elected government was to write educational policy which, when translated into practice, would improve the educational standards offered to students in impoverished schools while at the same time allow the maintenance of the high standards achieved in schools which had been privileged under the apartheid system. There was, furthermore, the challenge of providing a curriculum that would be meaningful to students from diverse backgrounds bearing in mind the socio-historical moment within which education found itself.Research on inclusive education in the developed world has been extensive. There has been less research completed in developing world countries. Situated in the Pietermaritzburg area of KwaZulu&#8208;Natal (KZN), South Africa, a developing world country, participants in the current study were parents of children with disabilities, aide workers, regular and special educators, managers who made decisions affecting the education of these children, and the children themselves. The research is positioned in the theory of interpretivism which provided the opportunity to give a voice to the participants, to interpret how they made sense of their world. The methodology used was qualitative description with an evaluation component. Qualitative description allowed the discovery and understanding of "a phenomenon, a process, or the perspectives and worldviews of the people involved" (Merriam, 1998, p. 11). Data are presented so that the participants' point of view could be understood and made explicit (Artinian, 1988). Using qualitative description, this current study explored the beliefs about disability and inclusive education specifically of stakeholders in the education of disabled children. The evaluation component provided the means of ascertaining the extent to which disabled students were having their educational needs met, and the extent to which the policy ideals of inclusive education, as articulated in White Paper 6 (Department of Education, 2001), were being achieved.Inclusive education in this present study is viewed as a multifaceted construct which shares a reciprocal relationship with various theoretical determinants. The determinants considered in the present study are (a) concept of other, (b) disability discourse, (c) equity, (d) reconceptualist/incrementalist approaches to inclusive education, and (e) prerequisites for regular and special educator buy-in.Findings revealed that there was evidence of inclusive education beginning to be implemented in KZN in that barriers to learning for many students were being addressed and removed. The specific provision in policy documents directed towards children with disabilities was behind schedule, however, and there was little evidence of full inclusion of students with disabilities in regular education. Reasons for this were multiple and were explored in relation to criteria at a macro- and micro-level, distilled from the literature, which seem to be necessary for the successful inclusion of students with disabilities.The most significant macro-level factors were (i) the legacy of apartheid and the democratic process, moving towards a liberal democracy, still being in progress; (ii) the discourse around disability espoused by the majority of the population resulting in high levels of ostracism of the disabled; and (iii) the disabled becoming lost in the wide definition of need in the barriers to learning approach to inclusive education.The most significant micro-level factors were (i) regular educators being reluctant to embrace the inclusive education initiative because of problems they had encountered with another recent initiative, the implementation of Outcomes Based Education; (ii) special educators fearing for their students if they were to be included without the requisite preparation and support; and (iii) some parents lacking the efficacy to access education of any sort for their disabled children.These macro- and micro-level findings exist within a multifaceted array of factors, an intricate web of nuances and complexity.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Inclusive education</field><field name="subject">South Africa</field><field name="subject">Democratisation</field><field name="subject">Disability discourse</field><field name="subject">Interpretive paradigm</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The making of a journalist: the New Zealand way</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Ruth</field><field name="description">This study is a first of its kind for New Zealand journalism education, following 20 students at two different schools throughout a year-long training programme. It used two methods to gain a deeper understanding: a discourse analysis of their news stories written at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the year, and retrospective protocol analysis, to provide insight into their thinking processes, through their taped reflections. The research found that journalism education controlled by the New Zealand Journalists Training Organisation still resembles that of 20 years ago, despite increasing numbers of students learning journalism as part of degree programmes. Students are trained for the media industry through learning by doing. They receive basic instruction and then are expected to perfect their skills by practising their writing and to learn the conventions and routines of the media industry through socialisation and work experience. In the first half of the year, the students developed some skills in writing the traditional inverted-pyramid news stories. However, by the end of the year, their news writing showed technical signs of regression. Firstly, they were not writing in a succinct, clear fashion, emphasising news values. Secondly, they had been inadequately trained to write outside of the inverted-pyramid news story or to use popular &#8220;soft&#8221; lead sentences, so that their writing tended towards being promotional. Thirdly, journalism institutions strongly favour subediting by tutors and this detracted from the students gaining understanding of their own writing and being able to self-monitor and evaluate it. Lastly, they failed to show the critical thinking skills and independence necessary for a professional journalist so that they could research thoroughly, reflect deeply and write entertaining, informative and important news stories with flair. Their reflections confirmed these findings, suggesting some stress and disillusionment. The students could &#8220;declare&#8221; what they knew about writing a news story but could not put it into practice. They blamed their failure to write high quality news stories on the pressures of the course, the deadlines and high volumes of stories. The gaps in their journalism education were also revealed through what was not mentioned in their taped reflections: in particular, they failed to mention the importance of news values in making their stories more appealing. The major influence at first was the students&#8217; tutors, followed by work experience and the &#8220;real world&#8221; of the media industry. The concentration on job skills and gaining a job coupled with a lack of knowledge and discussion provided the students with an incomplete understanding of the pressures of the media industry they were entering.  The study recommends more debate about journalism education and more research, as well as a change away from &#8220;learning by doing&#8221; to a more critical, reflective approach.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Journalism education</field><field name="subject">Skills-based training</field><field name="subject">Advantages of reflective practice</field><field name="subject">Discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Thinking-aloud</field><field name="subject">Learning by doing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Patterns in a world in slippage": playback theatre as professional development in three primary healthcare centres in Aotearoa New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Day, Fe</field><field name="description">This thesis is an account of praxis: it examines Playback conceptually, and portrays a programme of practical work exploring the experience of workplace audiences of five Playback Theatre performances, delivered from 2002-2005. The aim of the performances was to assist multi-disciplinary teams of staff in community health centres in Auckland New Zealand to communicate and work together with more understanding of each other. The thesis describes Playback as a way not only to elicit complex narratives which allow for diverse points of view to be expressed, but also as an aesthetic reworking of these narratives using action, music, dance, gesture and speech, in ways which have been influenced by 20th century avant-garde forms such as surrealism, dada, collage, jazz and poetry. Unlike some forms of theatre, Playback calls on elements of ritual and group method, in that it relies on audience members taking an active part in the performance by contributing narratives from their own lives. The thesis interrogates the notion of audience in theatre, using the words audience, spectator, spectactor, participant, public and polis, and specifically investigates two moments of the theatre as polis, in the French and Russian revolutions, when the potential of theatre to engage with the widest cross-section of the nation led to influential experiments and innovations in theatrical practice, each of which influenced the succeeding century. Some Playback discourse and practice is found to contain simplistic, even nostalgic, concepts of personal narrative, and the potential for performers&#8217; interpretations in Playback to reinscribe social privilege is noted. In spite of its simple structure, Playback demands extremely complex skills from all the performers, not only the facilitator. In addition, the complex setting of the practical work encompasses both local NZ health initiatives and developments in global health. The work in each Healthcare Centre is described in a complete chapter: each containing details of the Centre and the Playback, seen through the findings of the patient focus groups, through comments made in interviews by the staff and through the researcher&#8217;s observation and experience. In all three Centres, existential and emancipatory metanarratives surfaced in the performances and in interviews. Professionalism was seen as meaning different things: at Ng&#257;kau it was a measure by which people were found to be unsatisfactory; at Oranga, it referred to applying the lessons of the Playback to one&#8217;s own practice; while at P&#257;taka, professionalism was evident in narratives of self care, dedication and seeking clarification and support from peers. While the study revealed limitations of Playback, it also pointed to some unique contributions this form of improvisational theatre can make to a programme of staff or group development. In particular, Playback can open up spaces, people and topics, for non-dogmatic, pluralistic, embodied thinking and reflection, leading people to more nuanced understandings of themselves and each other, and can even affect attitudes and behaviours.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narrative</field><field name="subject">Audience</field><field name="subject">Playback theatre</field><field name="subject">Staff development</field><field name="subject">Radical hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">Primary healthcare</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The alchemy of love: recent graduates' lived experiences of psychotherapy training: a hermeneutic study</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Marilyn</field><field name="description">Most of the research related to psychotherapy is about modality, treatments and therapeutic outcomes. There is little research on the psychotherapists themselves; their subjective experiences, their preparation or personal development. Personal growth, which leads to a developmental level permitting self-reflection and relational ability, is considered by the psychotherapy profession to be an important aspect of the psychotherapist's education. This hermeneutic study focuses on students' experience of personal growth during a formal psychotherapy educational programme. The core of the thesis is the presentation of the students' lived experience during training. Recent graduates of psychotherapy programmes were interviewed and their accounts include the process of personal growth, in what ways the developmental journey was felt to be supportive and containing, ways graduates feel changed, the impact on their lives during and after the training, and the meanings they ascribe to the experience. The particular growth experiences of Maori graduates are to some degree explored, as are the experiences of psychotherapy teachers who facilitate personal development. Themes emerged from data analysis; personal growth did happen, was felt to be positive, and took place as a journey. The growth process was turbulent, painful, yet resulted in positive outcomes for the graduates. Love and relationship were experienced as the most significant catalyst in promoting growth towards key outcomes. It was felt that bicultural learning activities enhanced and supported growth for Maori and non-Maori. The nature and complexity of love is discussed; including the place of love in personal change, psychotherapy and psychotherapy training. The discomfort commonly experienced in the profession around describing the therapeutic relationship as one involving love is highlighted. Possible reasons are given for this, for not using the word love in psychotherapy. Implications for psychotherapy education arising from the research are presented; with questions about, and recommendations for, facilitating personal growth, and the utilisation of love in a more open and conscious manner as a part of psychotherapy training. Currently most preparation of psychotherapists occurs in mainstream academic institutions, with a movement in the profession towards more formal qualifications. It is a challenge for educators and students alike to continue to include in traditional academic structures and processes what is felt to be the essence of psychotherapy; love and relationship, the practice of which requires high levels of personal development.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">Psychotherapists - personal development</field><field name="subject">Psychotherapists' training</field><field name="subject">Psychotherapy students</field><field name="subject">Bicultural</field><field name="subject">Love</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/10</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The reliability of foot and ankle water volumetry</field><field name="creator">Balasundaram, Jeyakhanthan</field><field name="description">The objective of this study was to investigate the intra-rater (within day &amp; between days) and inter-rater reliability of foot/ankle water volumetry in healthysubjects.Study design: Repeated measures design with 2 raters.Background: Physiotherapists more often aim to reduce swelling in the acute phase of soft tissue injury. Reduction in swelling will hasten the healing process. Therefore swelling forms an important outcome measure that is worth studying during the healing process to determine the efficacy of the intervention. Though there are different methods available to measure extremity swelling, water displacement method is widely used in physiotherapy studies. Although water volumetry has been used to assess the reduction in swelling over time, there is paucity of reliability studies that have assessed the between-days reliability.Methods: Thirty normal subjects with asymptomatic ankles were measured by 2 raters. Three repeated foot volume measurements were performed by each of the rater using water volumetry during a single test session. The same procedure was repeated approximately at the same time on the 3rd day and 5th day following the 1st measurement day by the same raters on the same subjects. The raters were blinded to each other's measurements. The order for rater's volumetric measurement on each subject on each day was determined by a random chart produced by SPSS. The reliability was measured in terms of systematic bias (Paired t test &amp; Bland &amp; Altman's plot), absolute reliability (Limits of Agreement [LOA] &amp; Standard Error of Measurement [SEM]) and relative reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient [ICC]).Results: There was no systematic bias between any of the trials within day/between days or between raters. The intra-rater reliability within day as calculated by ICC; LOA and SEM were 0.99, &#177;10ml and &#177;3.5ml respectively and for between days reliability the values were 0.99 (ICC), &#177;20ml (LOA) and &#177;7ml (SEM) and for interrater reliability the values were 0.99 (ICC), &#177;13ml (LOA) and &#177;5ml (SEM). The results demonstrated that water volumetry method was highly reliable within day and between days for both the raters; and highly reliable between raters.Conclusion: Water volumetry is a highly reliable method for measuring foot/ankle volume repeatedly on different days. The random error range in milliliters (ml) as estimated by the absolute reliability indices provides the practical use of this method in a clinical/research setting.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ankle - wounds and injuries - measurement - evaluation</field><field name="subject">Foot - wounds and injuries - measurement - evaluation</field><field name="subject">Edema - measurement - evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/26</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Luminosity and illusion in the Bardo</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Mark</field><field name="description">This is a creative practice-based photographically researched project that is contextualised by a written exegesis. I am attempting to conceptualise the apparent visual experiences that occur during the dying process, death, and rebirth as believed within Tibetan Buddhism. The Bardo of life is also relevant as it pre-ordains the visual context of the experiences within the dying, death and rebirth Bardos.Through the medium of photography, my methodology and practice are reflective of two fundamental ideas. These are: Luminosity and Illusion. They are supported by my research into the phenomenon of the 'Near Death Experience' and the Jungian concept of the conscious and subconscious mind. These states of reality are explored in relation to the Tibetan Book of the Dead's concept of the Bardo. My focus is to photograph the four elements of Earth, Fire, Air and Water as mediums familiar to all human beings and relate these in context to the Tibetan Book of the Dead's description of entering the Bardo of death. Illusion and luminosity are discovered by 'seeing' these within the four elements, and are related in context to the Tibetan Buddhists' belief of an after-death reality. This transition from the dying process into the unknown Bardo of death is supported by the familiarity of these four elements in life, and the mind's notion of reality.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Luminosity</field><field name="subject">Illusion</field><field name="subject">Buddhism</field><field name="subject">Bardo</field><field name="subject">Death</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/27</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A phenomenological study of the experience of psychotherapists who meditate</field><field name="creator">Solomon, Paul</field><field name="description">My research explores the work of six psychotherapists who meditate. Vipassana meditation focuses on developing sensitivity to body sensations, which are understood to accompany all emotion experiences; experienced meditators can feel in their own bodies physical sensations that reflect the experience of a person in close proximity. An aim of the research was to discover whether their meditation practice had enabled the participants to use this ability in their work with patients. The study focuses on psychotherapists' lived experience during clinical hours, and enquires about how they direct their attention to their body sensations, and to the relationship with patients. The study explores links between the practice of Buddhist meditation and the evenly-suspended attention recommended by Freud, and further developed by Bion in his psychoanalysis without memory or desire. Because I was interested in many aspects of therapists' lived experience, I chose the methodology of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (Smith, 2003) as a framework for analysing the data. I drew on philosophical underpinnings offered by Heidegger and van Manen. The study showed that the participating psychotherapists were helped by their meditative training to develop a sensitive receptivity to their own physical sensations and emotion experience, predisposing them to be aware of limbic resonance with their patients' emotional and physical experiences. Some participants focused their meditative awareness on the ebb and flow of closeness and distance between themselves and their patients, in an orientation to psychotherapy that can be described as relational mindfulness.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychotherapy - religious aspects - Buddhism</field><field name="subject">Psychiatry and religion</field><field name="subject">Meditation - Buddhism</field><field name="subject">Meditation - therapeutic use</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/44</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hesitating performance</field><field name="creator">Harris, Brent</field><field name="description">This research project participates in the genre of Performance art. It explores performativity in relation to Emmanuel Levinas' formulation of two interlacing modes of language, the ethical saying and the ontological, political said. The saying is of my originary, ethical relation to the other person that constitutes me, whereas the said is the mode of 'content', knowledge, and ontology. The project suggests that at least two registers of performativity pertain to the saying. One is in Simon Critchley's description of the saying as performative, prior to any decision to perform. In regard to another meaning of performativity, I propose that a political signification of art may be what Levinas calls a "reduction" of the said that 'performs' a showing of the saying. To perform a showing of the saying, would, in a Levinasian engagement, be to make apparent the ultimate interruption by ethics of ontology and politics, thus pointing to a constitutive non-closure of the political like that theorized by Jacques Derrida and by Critchley. Such a non-closure of the political is tentatively linked with critiques of Nicolas Bourriaud's Relational Aesthetics such as Claire Bishop's which draw on Jacques Lacan's notion of the subject. Performances explore the notion of the "reduction" of ontology resourced by Derrida's formulation of Levinas' later writing style as involving a s&#233;riature; serial and heterogeneous interruptions of the said1. The project has unfolded in a series of performance pieces, and will conclude with a final performance in March 2007. This exegesis articulates the major provocations for the project, contextualises the project with regard to selected art practices, and documents and discusses the major performance pieces.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Performance art</field><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Emmanuel Levinas</field><field name="subject">Jacques Derrida</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/86</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling a Real Time Operating System Using SpecC</field><field name="creator">Nukala, Akilesh</field><field name="description">In today's digital (electronics) world, people's desire for electronic goods that ease their life at work, and leisure is increasing the complexity of the products of the embedded systems industry. For example, MP3 players for listening to music and cell phones for communicating with people.The gap between the hardware and software parts of embedded systems is being reduced by the use of System Level Design Languages (SLDL) that can model both hardware and software simultaneously. One such SLDL is SpecC.In this thesis, a SpecC model of a Real Time Operating System (RTOS) is constructed. It is shown how RTOS features can be incorporated into a SpecC model. The model is used to develop an application involving a robot avoiding obstacles to reach its destination. The RTOS model operates similar to the actual RTOS in the robot.The application includes a testbench model for the robot, including features such as interrupts, sonar sensors and wheel pulses, so that its operation closely resembles the actual robot. The sensor model is programmed to generate the values from the four sensor receivers, similar to the behaviour of the sensors on the actual robot. Also the pulses from the wheels and associated interrupts are programmed in the model so that it resembles the interrupts and wheel pulses present on actual robot.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SLDL</field><field name="subject">SpecC</field><field name="subject">RTOS</field><field name="subject">Robot</field><field name="subject">Obstacle avoidance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/87</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The stakeholder value and pedagogical validity of industry certification</field><field name="creator">Hitchcock, Leo</field><field name="description">In December 2004, at the SoDIS&#174; (Software Development Impact Statements) symposium in Auckland, an industry certification as a method of credentialing teachers and analysis of SoDIS was mooted.  SoDIS, a process of ethics-based risk assessment and analysis of downstream risk to project and software stakeholders, including the public, is currently in the process of progressing from prototype to commercial product.  Certification was proposed to ensure the integrity of the process and the quality of service to stakeholders.Certification sponsored by industry, commercial organisation, or professional association (collectively referred to as industry certification, or certification) has been a form of credentialing for over half a century.  Industry certification was adopted by the IT industry when Novell, Inc. began testing and certifying IT industry and IT network professionals in 1986 (Cosgrove, 2004; Novell, 1996).  Global certification testing centres were established in 1990 by Drake International (now Thomson Prometric) (Foster, 2005).During the 1990s, industry certification became a veritable juggernaut: a "multi-billion dollar business" (Cosgrove, 2004, p. 486), an industry that has arisen in its own right (Adelman, 2000) and driven by several dynamics (Hitchcock, 2005).  In 2000 there were over 300 discrete IT certifications with approximately 1.6 million individuals holding approximately 2.4 million IT certifications (Aldelman, 2000). The total number of available certifications is impossible to quantify (Knapp &amp; Gallery, 2003).  Many academic institutions both at tertiary and secondary level are integrating industry certification, especially IT certification, into their curricula.Is industry certification, however, a pedagogically robust form of credentialing?  Does it have value to its stakeholders?  Is it an appropriate form of credentialing for the SoDIS process?  This research, using both Phenomenography and Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) as a joint methodology, focuses on the experiences of actors with the phenomenon of industry certification and extracts both the essence of the understanding and perceptions of the value and validity of industry certification, and the essence of industry certification itself.Due to the vast amount of literature found describing industry actors' perceptions of and experiences within the phenomenon, the research is predominantly literature-based.  Further data was collected from interviews with a small, purposive sample of industry certification holders and employers, with the research further informed by my own experiences within the domain which is the focus of the research.  The methodology paradigm is interpretive: the research aims to interpret the social construction that is the phenomenon of industry certification.While this research does not attempt to single out specific industry certifications to determine their value or pedagogical robustness, the findings suggest that, in general, well designed and well administered certifications with integrity and rigour of assessment processes, are indeed pedagogically sound, with significant value.  The research identifies both benefit and criticism elements of typical certifications, along with elements of the various certification programmes categorised into standard (typical), and more rigorous (less typical) certification programmes.The research develops and presents a paradigm for building an appropriate vendor  specific or vendor neutral certification programme that is pedagogically sound with value for its stakeholders.  The contrasts and complementary aspects of industry certification and academic qualifications are highlighted. It is therefore concluded, and supported by data from the interviews, that such a credential is indeed appropriate for teachers and analysts of SoDIS.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA)</field><field name="subject">Phenomenography</field><field name="subject">IT industry</field><field name="subject">SoDIS (Software Development Impact Statements)</field><field name="subject">Professionalism</field><field name="subject">Credentialing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/90</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The housing experiences of the Auckland Somali population and their impact on the resettlement process</field><field name="creator">Adam, Halango M</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the impact of the housing experiences of resettled refugees. It reiterates that becoming a refugee was not a matter of choice, but for those in refugee situations it was imperative to seek refugee status for their survival. This study focuses on the housing experiences of the Auckland Somali resettled refugees and seeks to identify the effect of housing policy and provision in Auckland. It also demonstrates the links of housing to employment, education and health. Refugees face considerable resettlement challenges based on differential factors such as ethnocentrism, immigration status, household composition and socio-economic conditions. These barriers are exacerbated by a lack of English language proficiency, a variety of educational backgrounds and unfamiliarity with institutional practices, especially during their early years of adaptation as relative newcomers to New Zealand.The vulnerable position of this group in housing markets requires up to date information to increase the provider's awareness of housing experiences and their impact on the resettlement process. In turn, an increased knowledge allows evidence-based decisions for appropriate intervention, policy, and strategy developments to facilitate optimum resettlement outcomes. Policy formulation and effective implementation must focus on the identification of suitable services to address the specific barriers experienced by this group. The empirical evidence supports previous findings that there were close correlations between the participants housing experiences that are the types of housing they occupied and their income.The study developed and implemented a Participatory Research Design involving a case study approach with multiple data collection methods. The primary field data was collected from focus group participants through a workshop of qualitative discussion and a survey.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resettled refugees</field><field name="subject">Housing experiences</field><field name="subject">Resettlement</field><field name="subject">intergration</field><field name="subject">Somali resettlement in NZ</field><field name="subject">Participatory research design</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/93</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dwelling in architecture: design for a house for two strangers.</field><field name="creator">Hanlen, M A</field><field name="description">This exegesis seeks to explicate the current Masters project Dwelling in Architecture.

However, few studies exist which have investigated the effects of acute short-term Cr supplementation on appropriately simulated soccer-specific performance.Aims.  To determine the reproducibility of a 90 minute soccer-specific performance test and to subsequently examine the effects of acute short-term Cr ingestion (1 week) on soccer-specific physical performance. Study design.  Two experimental designs were adopted for this thesis.  For study one, a test-retest design was used to determine the reliability and validity of the Ball-sport Endurance And Sprint Test (BEAST).  Two trials of the BEAST were performed, separated by five to seven days.  For study two, a randomised, triple-blind, placebo-controlled experimental design was adopted to determine the efficacy of acute short-term Cr supplementation (seven days) on soccer-specific performance, using the BEAST protocol.Methods.  Twenty male amateur soccer players volunteered to participate in the study.  For study one, the test-retest reliability of several soccer-specific performance measures obtained during a modified version of the BEAST was quantified using the standard error of measurement (Van Cutsem, Duchateau, &amp; Hainaut) (or typical error) (Hopkins, 2000), coefficient of variation (CV), and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC).  For study two, the cohort was split and subjects randomly allocated to one of two groups (Cr supplementation and Placebo) on a matched-pair basis.  The Cr group (mean age 25.4 &#177; 4.5 years, mean body-mass 79.3 &#177; 10.5 kg) ingested 20 g of Cr and 8 g of glucose powder per day for seven days, whereas the placebo (mean age 26.7 &#177; 4.6 years, mean body-mass 80.8 &#177; 8.6 kg) group ingested 20 g of corn-flour and 8 g of glucose per day for seven days.  The effects of acute short-term Cr supplementation were analysed by repeated measures ANOVA.  In addition, effect sizes (ES) were calculated and entered with the associated p-value into Hopkins' spreadsheet for determination of the ES confidence limits (95%) and the chances that the true effect was substantial (i.e. ES &#8805; 0.2).  Clinical/practical inferences were made accordingly.Results.  Study 1: The BEAST protocol had good reliability (high ICC values, relatively low coefficients of variation, low noise to signal ratios) and face validity (HR, VO2, distances covered, duration, and movements performed in the BEAST were all similar to those reported in actual soccer matches).  Study 2: Performance of the four major physical measures (12 m sprint, 20 m sprint, circuit time and vertical jump) during the BEAST deteriorated during the second half relative to the first half for both Cr and placebo groups, indicating a fatigue effect associated with the protocol.  HR and body-mass values also decreased for both groups during the 90 minute protocol.  However, there was no statistically significant differences between the groups for these four measures  or for body-mass, HR or VO2max values, suggesting Cr had no substantial effect (relative to placebo) on improving physical performance (or reducing fatigue).  When the effects were assessed for the whole 90 minute BEAST protocol, all effects showed a negative trend and, correspondingly, the chances of a detrimental effect were greater than the chances of a beneficial effect.Conclusions:  The 90 minute BEAST protocol had good reliability and face validity making it a suitable soccer simulation and performance protocol with which to investigate the effects of Cr supplementation on soccer performance. However, no significant (statistical or clinical) effects of acute short-term Cr supplementation on soccer performance were observed suggesting its potential use as an ergogenic aid for soccer players is questionable.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creatine</field><field name="subject">Soccer</field><field name="subject">Supplements</field><field name="subject">Acute</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Simulated</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of teacher bilingualism</field><field name="creator">Martin, Derek</field><field name="description">This study introduces themes and trends apparent from notable research and literature regarding the value and usefulness of bilingual teaching methods in the ESOL classroom, and the perceptions of ESOL managers and teachers regarding these, both from an international and a New Zealand perspective. From this, a shortage of awareness and research in the New Zealand context was identified, which created an opportunity for further research. The study aimed specifically to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of Auckland based ESOL-school professionals regarding the value of teacher bilingualism and the use of other languages in the ESOL classroom. The basic method employed was a survey involving the distribution of questionnaires to 60 Auckland language school teachers and 20 Auckland language school managers, and included both qualitative and quantitative type questions. The study probed the foreign language skills and overseas work experience of the managers and teachers, and investigated whether these factors had influenced their perceptions regarding the value of teacher bilingualism and the use of other languages as an ESOL teaching tool. The study identifies the perceptions of Auckland ESOL professionals regarding these issues and analyses further differentiating factors likely to have influenced these perceptions. It identifies differences of opinion between managers and teachers and investigates reasons for these. The study analyses the linguistic composition of the Auckland language school clientele and considers implications for the industry resulting from the identified perceptions of ESOL professionals. Finally, the study offers suggestions for further future research, in the interest of improvement and enhancement of the industry.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bilingualism</field><field name="subject">Teachers</field><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">Communication in education</field><field name="subject">Foreign languages</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinant attributes of customer choice of banks, supplying mortgage products</field><field name="creator">Kotykhov, Mikhail</field><field name="description">The following research study attempts to identify the determinant factors, affecting the customer choice among alternative suppliers of mortgage products.

The subject of knowledge transfer is undisputedly important because knowledge is the essence of competitive advantage. In addition, multinational organisations are believed to be more effective at facilitating inter-firm knowledge transfer. The theoretical framework of this thesis is based on four constructs of knowledge transfer: motivation to transfer knowledge; richness of communication channels; absorptive capacity and organisational context. The research uses both quantitative and qualitative methods to explore these constructs. The research confirms the positive relationship between these constructs. Importantly, it highlights three knowledge transfer levels namely: pooling; assimilation; application and integration of knowledge into the multinational organisation. The research shows that knowledge must move through each of these levels if the focus is knowledge creation, these levels not to be treated as isolated but in fact overlapping. The research also found that high levels of espoused motivation are not always supported by proactive knowledge transfer behaviours. It demonstrated that at a certain level of knowledge transfer encouragement becomes less important than other motivational factors. Importantly, the multinational needs to manage knowledge transfer. To do this, the nature of knowledge must be considered and there needs to be an understanding that ad hoc knowledge transfer patterns can inhibit knowledge being transferred to where it may be needed. The research highlights how important it is for multinational inter-firm knowledge transfer to begin with the individual and then move to the organisation. The individual needs to have the necessary attitudes and ability to understand the benefits. Also, they need to understand that knowledge is not transferred through acceptance alone, but needs to be implemented. This means the multinational must provide strategic direction and structure that facilitates the movement of knowledge across the multinational organisation. Knowledge transfer routines must be managed to allow knowledge to move to where it can create unique knowledge because it is this unique knowledge that can be a strategic benefit to the organisation.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multinational organization</field><field name="subject">Knowledge management</field><field name="subject">Knowledge creation</field><field name="subject">Business strategy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resident perceptions of event impacts: Taupo and Ironman New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Buch, Tina</field><field name="description">In New Zealand the development and promotion of sporting events is becoming increasingly popular, due in part to the role of sport in building the nation's identity, the economic benefits, and a growing awareness of the importance of health and fitness within the community. Given this increased popularity it is important that the impacts of these events upon the local 'host' communities be understood. Social impacts have been given more and more attention in recent years by event researchers, due to the recognition that the long term sustainability of such events can only be achieved with the approval and participation of residents. This research addresses these issues in the context of Taupo, New Zealand using the case of Ironman New Zealand.This thesis adopts a mixed method approach using interviews (n=7), participant observation, and a web-survey (n=111). The findings confirm that it is vital to investigate and understand impacts of events on host communities. The findings are also consistent with theories identified in the literature in terms of the nature of social impacts on host communities. The overall results indicate that residents are aware of both the positive and negative impacts of Ironman New Zealand. Respondents highlight positive impacts such as economic benefits, exposure of Taupo, community togetherness, and the encouragement of sports, yet they also recognize negative impacts such as inconvenience from traffic congestion, and road closures. Accordingly, the community was grouped into three distinct clusters with positive, negative and ambivalent perceptions, and were labelled 'Lovers', 'Pessimists' and 'Realists'. The findings further suggest that the use of web-surveying for community research is still in its infancy and needs further development enabling it to be used as an effective tool. Finally it is proposed that small to medium scale sporting event hosted in regional communities may contribute to a sense of community and to the creation of social capital. Further research is needed to confirm this proposition.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resident perceptions</field><field name="subject">Sporting events</field><field name="subject">Community participation</field><field name="subject">Social impacts</field><field name="subject">Web-survey</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/190</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Touching a sensibility: a photographic exploration of haptic experience</field><field name="creator">Turner, Allen Julie (Jules)</field><field name="description">Touching a sensibility will attempt to locate the exchange when the living body physically touches the world.

Paradoxically, there is also a high prevalence of low birth weight in this population. Throughout life, factors associated with these abnormalities reflect genetic, environmental and lifestyle patterns.World-wide, the Indian population is largely non-meat-eating which could compromise the quantity and quality of the diet in macronutrients (proteins) and micronutrients (vitamin B12). Vitamin B12 has been suggested to increase the risk for the metabolic syndrome (dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hypertension and central adiposity). Factors measured in this pilot study designed to examine the differences between meat-eating and non-meat-eating Indian preadolescent girls were body composition, dietary food and nutrient analysis, physical activity patterns and biomarkers of diet and metabolic syndrome.Six non-meat-eating (9.8&#177;0.9 y) and six meat-eating (10.0&#177;0.6 y) Indian preadolescent girls participated in the two weeks study. Mothers and their daughters in each group had followed the same dietary pattern from birth. Anthropometry, hand-to-foot bioelectrical impedance and resting energy expenditure were measured. Biomarkers associated with one carbon metabolism; serum B12, methylmalonic acid (MMA) and folate were measured. Inflammatory markers; high sensitivity C-reactive protein and ferritin were measured. Serum lipids, fasting glucose and haematological parameters were measured. Time spent in sedentary activities and dietary information was extracted from seven day physical activity and food diaries respectively.There was an overall trend towards higher values for the non-meat-eaters as compared to the meat-eaters in body fat percent (29.7&#177;6.6 vs. 29.0&#177;6.2%, p = 0.85), and waist to hip ratio (0.89&#177;0.12 vs. 0.84&#177;0.07, p = 0.37) but the meat-eaters weighed more (31.2&#177;5.5 vs. 33.3&#177;9.6kg, p = 0.65). Compared to British reference ranges, girls in both groups had a higher BF% of 29&#177;6% which was 34 percentile points above the British median (McCarthy et al., 2006) adjusted for age.Both groups spent 21 hours each day in non-moving/sedentary activities. Dietary consumption of vitamin B12 was higher in meat-eaters compared to non-meat-eaters (2.5&#177;0.8 vs 1.8&#177;0.6&#956;g.day-1, p = 0.11). Serum vitamin B12 was substantially higher in the meat-eaters (543&#177;212 vs. 232&#177;95 pmol/L, p = 0.01) with lower serum concentrations of MMA (0.2 &#177; 0.1 vs 0.3 &#177; 0.2 &#956;mol/L, p=0.3). Serum folate was adequate in all girls ranging from 16.5-45.0 pmol/L, which was within the normal reference values. Two non-meat-eating girls were vitamin B12 deficient (&lt;170pmol/L). These differences were associated with high fibre and less protein intake in the nonmeat-eaters (30&#177;8 vs. 20&#177;7 g day-1; 64&#177;12 vs. 66&#177;11 g.day-1).The initial findings in this pilot study provide early evidence that risk factors for metabolic disease associated with body composition, diet and activity are accumulating in preadolescent Indian girls. Imbalance in one carbon metabolism is clearly a factor to be considered. In those with a low consumption of meat and/or animal products, B12 monitoring, dietary recommendations and if necessary supplementation should be considered and where possible intervention before pregnancy (as for folate) be a priority. New Zealand Indian people would be a priority group.It is time for serious action in this area of health so that the risk accumulated through an imbalance in nutrition and physical activity is reduced and the health of those as yet unborn is improved.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pre-adolescent girls</field><field name="subject">Indians</field><field name="subject">Obesity</field><field name="subject">Dietary patterns</field><field name="subject">Meat eaters</field><field name="subject">Vegetarians</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitor setups for IT helpdesk workers: a comparison study</field><field name="creator">Whalley, Sarah Marie</field><field name="description">In the hectic world of an IT helpdesk with an ever increasing number of applications and tasks on the go, managing the intricacies of how to navigate these is a cause of frustration for helpdesk workers. I had noticed while working on a helpdesk that the workspace area - particularly the monitor setups that IT helpdesk workers have to use - makes doing their job difficult. The number of applications open, the number of tasks on the go at once and the added pressure of customer contact, all call for applications and data to be accessed quickly - but the set up of the users workspace generally does not allow for this. The main objective of this research is to compare the difference between the use of a single screen, a dual screen and the new Multi-Layer Display (MLD) and the complications of having multiple applications and multiple monitors operating at one time for IT Helpdesk Workers. This research looked at how the users' monitor setup influenced the performance, efficiency, satisfaction, ergonomics and learning of the participants.The research showed that there was a clear dislike of the current set up of single screens; all participants felt that the single screen setup limited what they could do at once and it rated the least favourite of all. The dual and MLD screens showed positive outcomes for increasing multi-tasking abilities and raising users' perceived performance and satisfaction levels. The added screen real estate of both the dual and MLD over the single screen meant that users consistently had more information available to them 7which enabled them to complete tasks quicker, monitor other applications for incoming jobs, easily transfer data from one application to another and multi-task more effectively. While there were some minor ergonomic concerns and learning difficulties with the unique features and utilities of the both the dual and MLD monitors, participants still preferred to use these setups over the single screen.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IT personnel</field><field name="subject">Computer monitors</field><field name="subject">Dual screen</field><field name="subject">Multi Layer Display</field><field name="subject">Job performance</field><field name="subject">Ergonomics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/196</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of cyclic loading on the extensibility of human hamstring muscle-tendon units in vivo</field><field name="creator">Dombroski, Erik</field><field name="description">The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of cyclic loading on the extensibility of hamstring muscle-tendon units in vivo.Study Design: A test-retest randomised controlled trial with repeated measures was undertaken.Background: Stretching has been commonly promoted to increase the passive extensibility of the muscle-tendon units, yet the mechanism behind its proposed effects remains ambiguous. In vivo studies of stretching have mostly been limited to the viscoelastic characteristic of stress-relaxation. Few studies have investigated the characteristic of creep. Animal and cadaver in vitro creep experiments have consistently shown increases in the length of the soft tissues, with associated changes in their resistance and stiffness. These results however, might not be representative of human muscle-tendon units under in vivo conditions. Additionally, those in vivo human studies that have investigated creep phenomenon have contrasting results. To date, no known in vivo study has examined passive cyclic loading of human hamstrings to a constant load level.Method: Using a repeated measures design the extensibility of the hamstring muscles were assessed by a passive knee extension test (PKE) to maximal stretch tolerance using a KinCom&#174; dynamometer. Those participants in the intervention group underwent 45 continuous passive cyclic loadings as the KinCom&#174; dynamometer moved the knee joint into extension until torque reached 85% of maximal passive resistance torque measured in the passive knee extension test. The control group sat quietly relaxed during the intervention period. Measurements of hamstring passive extensibility using the PKE test were repeated at the end of the intervention.Results: Following the intervention, the PKE test showed for the cyclic loading group there was a significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in both maximal passive resistance torque (mean 23%) and knee joint angle (mean 6.3%). A significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease in passive resistance torque (mean 11.8%) when re-measured at the baseline position of maximal passive knee angle was observed. A significant increase (p &lt; 0.05) was found for passive stiffness over the final 10% of the knee torque-angle curve. No significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) was found for passive stiffness for the full (100%) of the torque-angle curve. Of the control group, no significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) were observed for all variables of the PKE test. Analysis of cycle one compared to forty-five of the cyclic loading intervention procedure showed a significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in both passive knee joint angle (mean 5.2%) and passive stiffness (mean 28.6%) over the final 10% of the knee joint torque-angle. No significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) was found for passive stiffness across the full (100%) knee joint torque-angle.Conclusion: The findings of the current study demonstrated that after cyclic loading the hamstring muscles lengthened and became stiffer over the final gained range of knee joint motion. Although the current study cannot determine the mechanism behind the changes in the variables of interest, these findings do provide some evidence that most likely a combination of altered stretch tolerance and local mechanical effects within the muscle-tendon unit, i.e. creep lengthening were responsible.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stretching exercises</field><field name="subject">Knee</field><field name="subject">Muscles</field><field name="subject">Tendons</field><field name="subject">Hamstring muscles</field><field name="subject">Exercise science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Association of ABO, Lewis and Secretor phenotypes and genotypes with Neisseria gonorrhoeae</field><field name="creator">Perry, Elizabeth Holly</field><field name="description">Previous studies of association of ABO phenotypes with gonorrhoea have shown contradictory results. Despite the interdependencies, none have examined the combined effect of ABO, Lewis and Secretor phenotypes. Furthermore, none have used genotyping to confirm phenotyping. This study is ground-breaking in this regard, and illustrates how such an association study should be performed. STUDY DESIGNS AND METHODS: The study examined 175 individuals who tested positive for gonorrhoea, and 211 individuals who tested negative for gonorrhoea. Strain typing was not performed. The following blood grouping methods were performed on the study participants: ABO phenotyping Lewis phenotyping, and genotyping of selected samples Secretor genotyping Chi-square and p values were used to examine whether or not there is an association of ABO, Lewis and Secretor blood group related molecules with gonorrhoea infection. RESULTS: Neither random statistical analysis of data sets, nor statistical analysis of data sets arranged by blood group, yielded a statistically significant association of ABO, Lewis and Secretor phenotypes and genotypes with Neisseria gonorrhoeae that could not be refuted when the data was disaggregated for ethnicity. The study did show a statistically significant difference in the incidence of the partial secretor phenotype (26.7%) in the gonorrhoea positive population and the incidence of the partial secretor phenotype (15.4%) in the gonorrhoea negative population, when all ethnic groups were analysed together. However, when the data was disaggregated for ethnicity, the p values were no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSION: There is no association of ABO, Lewis and Secretor phenotypes and genotypes with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Nevertheless, this study still has merit, because, to the author's knowledge, it is the first time a study of these human blood groups with a disease has been performed correctly.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phenotype</field><field name="subject">Gonorrhea</field><field name="subject">Health studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Work life balance: a Maori women's perspective</field><field name="creator">Harris, Ngaire Te Aroha</field><field name="description">Spending time at work, with family/whanau, and communities takes up a large proportion of Maori women's lives. Finding a balance can often be complex and challenging, due to surrounding environmental influences that are continually changing.  This thesis explores those challenges, and considers whether 'being Maori' affects the way they manage their lives around the dimensions of work family/whanau and community.The study interviewed Maori women over 20 years of age, in paid work, and who were active members in two urban Maori communities of Auckland, namely Te Whanau o Waipareira Trust and Manukau Urban Maori Authority.It was anticipated that information gleaned could be used to consider positive strategies to facilitate the better management of their time given the constraints imposed on them by modern existence without compromising their cultural obligations as Maori actively involved in their communities.Overall, it was found that being Maori does have an affect on how the women manage their lives around work, family/whanau, and community. A number of factors are identified that help balance work and everyday life including whanau and community support as well as individual strategies and personal assistance. For example, flexible employers that valued Maori beliefs and culture helped reinforce and facilitate the achievement of this balance. Similarly, quality childcare was invaluable. Further research is suggested as to how Maori women balance competing priorities from community and whanau demands.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Paid employment</field><field name="subject">Family</field><field name="subject">Whanau</field><field name="subject">Urban Maori</field><field name="subject">Community involvement</field><field name="subject">Flexibility in employment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heavy metal concentrations in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas</field><field name="creator">Perera, Percy</field><field name="description">Heavy metals present in high concentrations in aquatic habitats are bioaccumulated within the tissues of intertidal organisms. The chemical analyses of animal tissues and sediments provide an indication of bioavailability of heavy metals in the environment. Monitoring of the coastal pollution using organisms is widely practiced all over the world.Chemical analysis of the tissues of Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, and river sediments were used in this study to monitor the environmental concentrations, of cadmium, copper, lead and zinc of shallow coastal areas near to the river mouths of Mahurangi, Awaruku, Waiake, Taiorahi and Wairau. All of these river mouths are situated along the northeastern coast of Auckland. Each month, during the period of November 2002 to October 2003, three replicate samples of oysters, and sediments were collected from each of the river mouths for analysis. Three additional replicate samples of oysters were collected separately, in each month in order to calculate the condition index of oysters. Oyster tissues and sediments were analysed with Inductively Coupled Atomic Plasma Emission Spectrometer to detect the concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead and zinc.The highest level of copper and zinc concentrations in the oyster tissues was observed in the river mouth of Wairau. Wairau river mouth receives water from heavily urbanised and industrialised catchments. A higher concentration of cadmium was observed in the oysters of the river mouth of Mahurangi than in the oysters in the other sites. The reason for this difference could be due to the heavy use of cadmium contaminated fertilizers at the pasture lands situated around the Mahurangi estuary. Therefore, the relationship between the land use of the catchments and the degree of pollution of the estuarine habitats could be established from the data obtained from this study. Higher concentrations of heavy metals were found in the sediments of Waiake, Taiorahi and Wairau compared to the sediments of Mahurangi and Awaruku. Significantly higher level of copper was observed in the sediments of Awaruku. However no clear co-relation was found between heavy metal concentration in oysters and in sediments. Variations of the condition of oysters were closely related to seasonal changes of the life cycle of the oysters. No clear relationship was found between the condition of the oysters and the heavy metal concentration of the river mouth habitats.This study provides evidence that Pacific oysters are good organisms to use as bioindicators of environmental heavy metal levels in shallow coastal waters. The results of this study suggest a clear relationship between the heavy metal concentration in river waters and the land use of the catchment areas of those rivers. The results may be useful in management strategies of the northeastern coastal areas of Auckland.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oysters</field><field name="subject">Oyster culture</field><field name="subject">Pollution</field><field name="subject">Heavy metals</field><field name="subject">Enviornmental studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The acute effects of weight training on softball throwing velocity</field><field name="creator">Sheehy, Kevin M</field><field name="description">The short-term enhancement of physical performance known as post-activation potentiation could be exploited in the design of sport-specific training sessions. The purpose of this study was to compare the potentiation of softball throwing velocity following two kinds of resistance-training session: a control session consisting of traditional heavy-load sets, and an experimental "Pmax" session consisting of sets of loads selected to maximise the mean power output during explosive bench presses.  Both sessions included plyometric medicine ball chest passes.  Eight male softball players of premier grade, with at least 2 yr experience of resistance training, performed the two sessions in a crossover fashion, with 30 min recovery between sessions. Softball throwing velocity was measured with a radar gun immediately before and at 2-min intervals 4-10 min after each session. Percent effects on throwing speed were analyzed via log transformation, and t statistics were used to make magnitude-based inferences with respect to the smallest important change of 2%. The average throwing velocity increased between pre and post tests for both treatments; the average increase was a substantial 2.3% (0.5 to 4.1%).  Throwing velocity after Pmax training was a trivial 0.4% slower relative to that after heavy-load training (90% confidence limits -1.2 to 1.9%). There was a greater change in throwing velocity by 10 min post treatment than by 4 min post treatment; the change by 10 min was 5.0% (3.2 to 6.7%) for the Pmax training session and 5.3% (2.1 to 8.6%) for the heavy-load session. These effects were almost certainly beneficial for throwing speed, but the difference between them was unclear (-0.3%; -3.7 to 3.1%). The mean change between 4 and 10 min for both treatments combined was 5.1% (90% confidence limits 3.6 to 6.7%). The short-term enhancement of throwing performance following heavy-load and Pmax training sets has implications for the design of softball warm-up routines. There is also the potential for softball players to use such training to improve their throwing velocity during games.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Softball</field><field name="subject">Weight training</field><field name="subject">Physiology</field><field name="subject">Improved throwing performance</field><field name="subject">Post activation potentiation</field><field name="subject">Pmax</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Passionate dedication: a qualitative and descriptive study of nurses' and hospital play specialists' experiences on a children's burn ward</field><field name="creator">Isaac, Dorothy</field><field name="description">A qualitative descriptive approach was undertaken to explore the experience of eight registered nurses and two hospital play specialists who care for children hospitalised with burn injuries. The research participants were recruited from a paediatric ward that offers centralised specialty care to children with burns. Collected through face-to-face interviews, the participants' stories were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim using a process for analysis informed by van Manen, (1997b).Emerging out of the data was the over-arching theme of 'passionate dedication' that shows the nurses and hospital play specialists genuine compassion and commitment to meet the needs of the children with burns. The findings of the study reveal that the participant's dedication is shaped and determined by a dynamic process that involves having professional integrity and in-depth knowledge of caring for children and burn management. The nurses and the hospital play specialists have a common understanding of what their role entails and the skills required to provide quality care and support to the children and the children's family. On a personal and professional level the participants encounter several challenges in this care context that are physically and emotionally overwhelming. Despite becoming overwhelmed the participants are revealed as being resourceful and resilient in their aptitude to find ways that enable them to cope and get through.This study supports international literature that suggests that caring for children with burns is equally rewarding, as much as it is physically and emotionally demanding. The implication in this study for the organisation is to seriously consider issues regarding productivity and efficiency of the workforce with acknowledgement that nurses and hospital play specialists cannot do this emotional work without effective systems of support in place. With the help of team leaders, managers and educators, the organisation will need to consider ways to monitor the job satisfaction of their staff. Furthermore, reinforce existing comprehensive measures, such as mentorship and clinical supervision programmes to encourage the retention and well-being of all staff, at all stages of their career on the children's burn ward.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Paediatric nursing</field><field name="subject">Play specialists</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Burns</field><field name="subject">Qualitative methodology</field><field name="subject">Descriptive study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing employee customer service interpersonal exchanges in the hospitality industry: a New Zealand hotel case study</field><field name="creator">Goodsir, Warren</field><field name="description">The continued growth of service industries and the development of the experience economy has highlighted the need for employees to have extensive social and interpersonal skills. The need for employee interpersonal skills is further emphasised by the extensive interaction between employees and customers, during the provision of customer service, in full service hotels. Despite the heterogeneous nature of the customer service environment, management expect that a consistent level of service will be maintained, while customers desire a unique experience that meets or exceeds their individual expectations. To ensure that both the needs of the organisation and customers are consistently met, management control of employee actions and behaviours is required.The aim of this study was to identify how hotel organisations and managers control employee interpersonal interactions with customers. The research also sought to identify the interpersonal and emotional capabilities employers require from employees to meet the needs of customers and present the desired corporate image. A qualitative, case study, research methodology was applied to understand the expectations of managers, the issues concerning managing employee interactions with customers, perceptions of employee capabilities, and beliefs about current management control strategies in a hotel environment. The research was conducted at four hotel properties belonging to one international hotel group. The data gathering methods included semi-structured interviews, documentation review and field notes.The research concluded that effective alignment of employee and management goal congruence first requires the alignment of managers' goals to the organisation. To ensure management's expectations, customers' expectations and employee actions and behaviours are aligned, management must also have a sound understanding of the organisation's brand and desired image. Cultural and social control mechanisms were found to be important, as they provided a consistent method of aligning employees' behaviour with the goals and expectations of management. The development of social cohesion and norms, through serial and investiture socialisation mechanisms, also helped to create self-managing teams that reinforced the goals of management. The study suggests that, due to the increasing diversity of the stakeholders' views and goals, some of the traditional management perspectives of hospitality may need to change to meet the needs of contemporary employees.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Customer service</field><field name="subject">Management control</field><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="subject">Interpersonal</field><field name="subject">Customer orientated behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of physiotherapy and RICE self treatment advice for early management of ankle sprains</field><field name="creator">Lopes, Justin</field><field name="description">Ankle sprains are one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries.  Physiotherapy treatment and advice to rest, use ice, use compression, and elevate the ankle (RICE advice) is believed to speed up the functional recovery and enhance healing associated with acute ankle sprains.  However, there is limited evidence to support the efficacy of RICE treatment.  This study investigated whether physiotherapy (including RICE advice) was as effective as RICE advice alone in improving the time to recovery in a clinical situation.The evidence for RICE advice was reviewed along with the different treatment modalities currently used by physiotherapists in New Zealand for acute ankle sprain.  This review highlighted the low number and poor quality of studies investigating RICE and early intervention physiotherapy management for ankle sprains.  RICE principals appear to be relatively inexpensive and somewhat effective for pain relief and may reduce further tissue damage in the acute stage of Grade I and II ankle sprains.  Evidence extrapolated from studies investigating the use of post surgical ice appears to support the use of ice in the acute stage of an ankle sprain to minimise bleeding and oedema.  The intermittent application of ice is more effective for pain relief in the acute phase than sustained icing.  Physiotherapy interventions such as TENS for pain relief and bracing for the support of Grade II - III ankle sprains have been shown to be beneficial for pain relief in the acute phase.  A need for further high quality, randomised controlled trials (RCT's) was identified.Subsequently a RCT was conducted with 28 participants to investigate the difference between (a) early intervention physiotherapy management combined with RICE advice, and (b) self management RICE advice without physiotherapy.Twenty eight individuals (males n = 22, females n = 6), between the ages of 16 and 40 with acute ankle sprains, who met the inclusion criteria, were approached by physiotherapists working on this project and invited to participate.  Dependant variables were pain, function, swelling, compliance and medication use up to Day 11 post injury.  Swelling, pain and function were measured over three assessments on Days 1, 3 and 11, using volumetric analysis, a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a functional question derived from a validated functional questionnaire respectively.  Medication use and compliance were elicited from information gathered in a participant home diary. Both groups were similar on Day 1 in respect to their initial pain, swelling, the number of participants who were referred for X-rays, and the time taken to present to the physiotherapist.  However the RICE group had significantly higher function scores (p = 0.042).  The RICE group also had a significantly higher use of medication on Day 1 (p = 0.035) and Day 11 (p = 0.048).  For both groups there was a statistically significant decrease in swelling (p = 0.003), pain scores (p = 0.000), and an increase in function scores (p = 0.000) in relation to time over the eleven days of assessment.  The physiotherapy group had significantly improved function scores (p = 0.042) from Day 1 to Day 11 compared to the RICE group.  There were no significant differences between groups for swelling, pain scores, and their first day of documented non-compliance.  The within day range of error in the volumetric measurements was within 189.9 ml and 1.2 ml.  Three trials were conducted per person within a Day session.  The first volumetric analysis was significantly less than the subsequent two measurements (p = 0.040).It was concluded that, in the early stage of an ankle injury both physiotherapy and RICE, and RICE advice alone, resulted in significant improvements in swelling, pain and function.  Early intervention physiotherapy was significantly better at improving the functional ability of participants by Day 11.  Early intervention physiotherapy may also identify complications associated with ankle sprains.Despite its limitations this research could potentially lead to changes in the standard treatment protocols for soft tissue ankle injuries.  Implementation of self management RICE by patients in the acute stage would initially reduce the cost of physiotherapy treatments, and may lead to equal improvements in pain and swelling outcomes.  However, it appears that physiotherapy may lead to better functional outcomes which would reduce the costs associated with time off work, and rehabilitation.  It is important to note that these findings are based on a small sample size and on Grade I or II ankle ligament sprains, and that treatment for more severe ankle injuries may be better with physiotherapy, or surgery, rather than self management RICE by patients.  Findings contribute to the growing body of 'best practice' evidence for health practitioners.

Despite the fact that women aged 18-39 years now outnumber men within New Zealand universities, there is still evidence of inequality for pregnant university students.A qualitative case-study approach was used to explore and describe the stages and patterns of transition from being a university student to becoming a pregnant university student. Each woman demonstrated the complexity of the transitions. The pregnant body and becoming visible were factors that impacted on all five women who participated in this study. The case studies describe how pregnancy intervened in the experience of being a student.Various coping mechanisms were employed by these pregnant university students. The research suggests that they find balance through compartmentalizing aspects of their lives. They attribute educational and personal outcomes to luck.

Previous reviews of caffeine's effects on exercise performance have been limited to qualitative analysis.  The purpose of this paper was therefore to quantitatively meta-analyze the effects of caffeine on exercise performance.  We identified 90 estimates of performance effects of caffeine in 32 peer-reviewed studies.  All estimates were converted to mean power in an equivalent time trial then subjected to a mixed-model meta-analysis.  The fixed effects were gender, training status (elite athlete, non-elite athlete, non-athlete), dietary caffeine status (habitual consumer, non-consumer), caffeine abstention period, caffeine dose (mg/kg body mass), type of caffeine (pure or in coffee), delay between ingestion and performance test, duration of test, and presence or absence of fatiguing exercise before the test.  The random effects accounted for within- and between-study variance.  We found that caffeine enhanced mean power by 2.8% (90% confidence limits &#177; 1.1%) in male non-elite athletes who are habitual caffeine consumers abstaining from caffeine for 2 d before consuming 6 mg/kg of caffeine capsules 1 h before performing a 30-min time trial without intervening fatiguing exercise.  The effects for other athletes and conditions were:  females, 3.1% (&#177; 2.7%); elite athletes, 2.9% (&#177; 1.4%); non-athletes, 1.3% (&#177; 1.2%); habitual non-consumers, 4.0% (&#177; 1.4%); 7 d of abstention, 3.4% (&#177; 2.6%); 0.3 mg/kg of caffeine, 1.6% (&#177; 5.3%); caffeinated coffee, 1.0% (&#177; 1.6%); 2-h delay before exercise, 2.9% (&#177; 1.2%); 6-s exercise test, 1.6% (&#177; 1.7%); prior fatiguing exercise, 3.0% (&#177; 1.6%).  Each of these effects of caffeine varied typically between studies by &#177; 1.4% (the between-study random effect; 90% confidence limits &#177; 0.9 to &#177; 3.5%).  We conclude that caffeine has a greater effect on performance with athletes, with habitual non-consumers of dietary caffeine, when administered as pure caffeine, and in endurance exercise, but there is considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of the effects on individuals.  More research is needed to reduce this uncertainty and to determine the performance effects of caffeine with females, following longer periods of dietary abstention, in low doses, and for brief exercise.  There has also been no research on effects of caffeine on the repetitive fatiguing exercise typical of team sports.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Caffeine</field><field name="subject">Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Sports</field><field name="subject">Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Exercise science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The meaning and importance of service for health professionals</field><field name="creator">Raleigh, Susan</field><field name="description">The primary purpose of this study was to explore and identify the meaning and importance of service for health professionals. Those who participated in this study are all registered nurses who each have between 10 and 40 years of clinical nursing and nurse lecturing experience. The participants each wrote two stories, one about the meaning of service and the other about the importance of service. Definitions of service generally suggest organised labour involving an act of help or assistance. Our intent was to understand what constituted service for each of us in the healthcare - and specifically the nursing practice/education - context.A secondary purpose of this qualitative research was guided by participatory and critical theory paradigms. Seven participants and I (as the initiating researcher) formed a co-operative inquiry group to undertake the research using a collaborative process. Within this method the leader and the group became co-participants and co-researchers. Nurses and women are identified as marginalised people and by honouring the principles of co-operative inquiry we were empowered through this process. While the initial data was analysed thematically by the lead researcher, the original 19 sub-themes were refined by participants into five themes.The findings of the participants are consistent with overseas studies on emotional labour and sentimental work. The five themes that emerged as the meaning of service are helping, giving, elements of service, acts of doing, and pride in work. Helping was defined as an attitude and an action, which often results in a spiritual connection. Giving involves stretching yourself, and altruistic behaviour that also incorporated a spiritual component. Five sub-themes merged to form the third theme elements of service; working with people, being a public servant, being a servant, need and duty. The complexity and hidden aspect of service work was expressed in acts of doing where being professional was paramount. The final theme, pride in work, acknowledged childhood conditioning and a sense of contributing to the greater good through our unique work as nurses. This study affirmed that service has much importance to those involved and deepened our understanding of the blend of meanings service expresses.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Service as vocation</field><field name="subject">Helping</field><field name="subject">Elements of service</field><field name="subject">Act of doing</field><field name="subject">Pride in work</field><field name="subject">Spiritual care</field><field name="subject">Emotional labour</field><field name="subject">Caring</field><field name="subject">Compassion</field><field name="subject">Sentimental labour</field><field name="subject">Giving</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/297</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nga kapua whakapipi a tamamutu - strength in unity nurturing future Turangitukua leaders</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Evelyn  H</field><field name="description">Education is development. It helps to create choices and opportunities for people, reduce the twin burdens of poverty and diseases, and give a stronger voice in society. For nations it creates a dynamic workforce and well-informed citizens able to compete and cooperate globally - opening doors to economic and social prosperity.This study examines how a small group of students coped under conditions of adversity. It follows in the tradition of a wide body of qualitative work that has investigated ethnic minorities and their educational experiences. Much of the existing work, however, focuses on merely describing thematically and/or conceptually, what goes on. This study aims to construct an integrated conceptual understanding of how a minority group engaged in the coping process. More specifically, this study seeks to develop a substantive theory that can help explain and predict human behaviour. Grounded theory methodology was used in aid of the theory development process (Glasser and Strauss, 1967). Put simply, grounded theory is an inductive methodology that attempts to understand action from the perspective of social actors (Brooks, 1998).To uncover the coping process, the Turangitukua students and their Hapu (sub tribe) in New Zealand are used as the main data source. Two other student groups were used for comparative purposes. Data was obtained by a number of means; including interviewing, focus groups, hui (meetings), and documentary analysis. The collected data was summarised and analysed over a two- year period.This study contributes to three areas of research. First, it adds to the small but growing body of work relating to Turangitukua hapu (sub-tribe) in New Zealand. Second, it contributes to research in the area of Maori and non-Maori relationships, especially work that focuses on interaction. And finally, it adds to the formal theoretical literature on indigenous educational settings and its management.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="subject">Ethnic minorities</field><field name="subject">Indigenous people</field><field name="subject">Maori students</field><field name="subject">Educational opportunity</field><field name="subject">Coping with adversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns and motifs in the Va: a Samoan concept of a space between</field><field name="creator">Clayton, Leanne</field><field name="description">This project is an exploration of the endless negotiation of the va, the relationships that consistently define and redefine themselves in the space between two cultures. The va consists of relationships between people and things, unspoken expectations and obligations: the inherent and changeable patterns, of obligations and expectations between people and their environment. The va space can be viewed as the stage upon which all patterns and motifs carry meaning. How the patterns and motifs change meanings are subject to other elements in the va. Meaning in my work will evoke the interweaving connections of past and present through oral history, genealogy, and fagogo&#185; (story telling) memory and artist sentiment. As participant, the artist reflects through the remembrance of sifting through images, person, family, events, time, and space. An emphasis will be placed on the exploration of pattern and motif as a signifier of events and sign of respect, with a focus on notions of the va. The project explores notions of visual patterns and motifs to be utilized as a vehicle to signify in that all patterns and motifs carry meaning in that they signify an event, person, time, and space.

The function of local Chinese media could be like a bridge connecting the Chinese community and the mainstream society. This was an exploratory study which examined the current situation of local Chinese media to determine such issues as to whether they are the main source of information for the Chinese community, what if any difficulties they are facing and how they may develop in the future. A general research was conducted for the local Chinese media in Auckland, which covers brief introductions for some local Chinese newspapers, radio, websites, and the sole Chinese television company-World TV. Meanwhile, the researcher collected 102 questionnaires and conducted 10 in-depth interviews from the local Chinese residents and the staff working in local Chinese media companies. The findings of research suggest that most local Chinese residents utilize Chinese language media as a tool to collect daily information either from local society or their original countries. The local Chinese media not only provides information for the local community, but also has social value as a means for self-representation of the Chinese community in New Zealand and better adaptation to the mainstream society. On the other hand, the funding shortage as well as the tough competition became the obstacles for the future development for the local Chinese media. The results of this research may point to what the government&#8217;s role should be.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Questionnaires</field><field name="subject">Face to face interviews</field><field name="subject">Diasporic media</field><field name="subject">Mainstream media</field><field name="subject">Minority media</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Backpackers: the next generation?</field><field name="creator">Markward, Anne</field><field name="description">New Zealand has a well-established network of accommodations, transportation, and visitor activities developed specifically for backpackers. These tourists account for almost ten percent of the country&#8217;s international visitor expenditure. To date, the majority of backpacker research has focussed on the traditional market segment of student and youth travellers, though a few quantitative studies have also researched the needs and preferences of older travellers using hostels and backpackers&#8217; accommodations. Though more than 50 percent of New Zealand&#8217;s international visitors are over age 40, few currently stay at this type of accommodation. Using New Zealand as a case study, this thesis explores, qualitatively, the perspectives of older backpackers: their self-perceptions, their travel motivations, their needs and expectations in accommodation. In addition, it examines the points of view of the owners of small, independent backpackers&#8217; accommodations to gain their perspectives on hosting a multi-generational clientele and on what the implications might be of expanding this market. Key findings show that older travellers who use backpackers&#8217; accommodations technically meet all Pearce&#8217;s (1990) original definitions of &#8220;backpacker&#8221; &#8211; they prefer budget accommodations, they are socially interactive, they travel independently and flexibly, they travel for longer holidays than do most, and they choose informal and participatory activities. However, these travellers reject the self-definition of &#8220;backpacker&#8221;, an impasse that presents a lexical challenge to both scholars and tourism marketers.  The final section addresses the impacts and implications of &#8220;backpacker&#8221; nomenclature on baby boomer travellers, academia, and the backpacker industry at large.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Backpackers</field><field name="subject">Baby boomers</field><field name="subject">Budget travel</field><field name="subject">Travel motivations</field><field name="subject">Self-perception</field><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finding the shadows in the mirror of experience: an ontological study of the global-co-worker</field><field name="creator">Fleck, Kenneth</field><field name="description">This study explores the phenomenon of a personal exploratory field visit to HIV programmes in Malawi and how that informs my future plans to work cross-culturally with HIV.  I use hermeneutic phenomenology with the guidance of Heidegger and Gadamer, and draw on Ackermann, Hill, Maluleke, Moltmann, and Thielicke for theological direction. This study analyses how personal formation takes place and how the meaning of that experience can inform future cross-cultural interaction.  The data of this study is drawn from a range of people interviewing &#8216;me&#8217;. This includes a pre and post interview in relation to my three week exploratory visit to Malawi, and recorded daily reflections during the visit.  Upon return I was interviewed about my experience by ten people from the following areas: nursing, counselling, development, theology, business, medicine, clergy, an Expatriate Malawian, and a women working from a Maori paradigm.  These interviews focused on my experience with questions framed from the interviewer&#8217;s specialty area.  The transcripts become further data for my study. The findings of this thesis suggest that people wishing to work cross-culturally need to understand their motivation for their work, and understand who they are before entering a foreign land.  This transformative journey also needs to continue as part of the process of working with people because we can only be effective with change if we are listening and hearing the other&#8217;s perspective.  It is in being open to this difference between persons that we continue to find ourselves.  While perhaps we have a tendency to want to make everybody like us, we can only grow into our full potential in relationship with truly different others.  Tensions I experienced demonstrate that there is a complex need to understand how the context controls how HIV is perceived.  This requires uncovering some of the deeper issues of HIV and culture, and knowing how to conceptualise these in both positive and informative ways.  This thesis asks four key questions for the global-co-worker to work through before embarking on cross-cultural mission: 1. How do you know you should go?; 2. How are you going to make a difference?; 3. Who are you going to be?; and 4. What will sustain your involvement?  My own experience has drawn me into a deeper awareness of the need for a vital connectedness of faith, hope and love underpinning the everydayness of such an experience.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Working cross-culturally with HIV and AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-discovery</field><field name="subject">Hermeneutic Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Theology, health care, and development</field><field name="subject">Reflective thinking</field><field name="subject">Exploratory field visit to Malawi</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/468</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physiological effects of flushing ewes on ovulation and embryo survival</field><field name="creator">Averill, R. L. W.</field><field name="description">Prolificacy in sheep, under most types of flock management, may exert an overwhelming influence on profitability. Three major classes of sheep farming are found in New Zealand, namely Extensive farming, on high country and droughty areas where wool is the chief product, Store sheep farming, on harder hill country, where income is derived from sales of both wool and surplus stock, and Fat lamb farming, in the easier and improved areas, where sales of fat stock almost exclusively dictate the size of the income. In all three types, ewe fertility is of paramount importance.  This investigation was undertaken as a pilot attempt to demonstrate, with more accuracy, the source of, or reason for, the additional lambs which result from flushing ewes, in as far as this practice may increase both ovulation rate and subsequent mortality or merely reduce mortality in developing ova at some as yet underdefined stage of early pregnancy. The nature of the experiment was such that a study of the time-relationships of ovum loss and embryo mortality at various stages in early pregnancy could be made. Thus the matings of 225 ewes in two separate mobs were observed and slaughter dates were measured for individual ewes from  mating times. By this means a considerable collection of both field and laboratory data was made available for a study of comparative individual and group reactions to the flushing treatment applied.</field><field name="date">1952</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">ewes</field><field name="subject">flushing</field><field name="subject">ovulation</field><field name="subject">fertility</field><field name="subject">reproduction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300402 Animal reproduction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300403 Animal nutrition</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300406 Animal growth and development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Host-parasite coevolution in New Zealand: how has Odontacarus, a mite with a free-living stage in its life-cycle, coevolved with its skink host?</field><field name="creator">Vargas, Mariana L.</field><field name="description">The effect of a free-living stage in host-parasite coevolution: a skink mite phylogenetic study in New Zealand.   During the last decade, phylogenetic trees have even been used to compare ecologically related taxa such as parasites and their hosts, and are used to determine their level of coevolution or reciprocal adaptation in time. Diverse coevolutionary events have been detected for this ecological association, where generally the parasite has been regarded as one that feeds exclusively on the host and is likely to cospeciate with it. A different coevolutionary pattern might occur when the parasite has a free-living stage in its life cycle, in which the parasite may have the opportunity to abandon its host and successfully colonise a new species (host-switching) making cospeciation less likely. Many New Zealand skinks are infested with a parasitic mite, Odontacarus sp. (Prostigmata: Leeuwenhoekiidae), which becomes free-living as an adult. The genetic variation of these mites found on four hosts was analyzed for host- parasite coevolutionary events. The hosts were the McCann&#8217;s skink and the common skink in coastal Birdling Flat, Canterbury, plus these species and the Grand and Otago skinks in Macraes Flat, Central Otago, South Island, New Zealand. The genetic variation of fast evolving nuclear Internal Transcribed Spacers 2 and mitochondrial Cytochrome c Oxidase I in Odontacarus mites found on these hosts was determined by PCR and DNA sequencing and phylogenetic trees were built using the computer programs PAUP*4 and MrBayes 3. The results show that mite haplotypes only had a significant geographical division and no host-related differences. In Birdling Flat, the COI haplotypes were represented in two groups that infested both regional hosts and had 5.7 % divergence. The same individual mites belonged to a single ITS 2 haplotype, thus indicating a historical geographical division between two populations that now interbreed successfully. The Macraes Flat mites were divided into two COI haplotypes with 2.4% divergence and internal nodes, which showed greater genetic variability than the Birdling Flat populations. The Macraes Flat mites formed two ITS 2 haplotypes with 6% divergence. This greater geographical structure of the Otago mites is probably due to the older age of the mainland area compared to the recently exposed coastal locality of Birdling Flat. The COI haplotypes from the two different regions had a mean distance of 15.5%, with an earlier divergence time than that known for the hosts. For both genes, the haplotypes from different regions had 100% bootstrap support and the parasite showed no host specificity. Mites of the different COI and ITS haplotypes were found on most of the host species that were sampled in Canterbury and Otago. The results of this study suggest that a free-living stage in a parasite&#8217;s life cycle can favour coevolutionary events such as inertia (failure to speciate) and host-switching, probably as a result of resource-tracking of the parasite.

Even before its introduction, there were fears within the rugby union community that league would replace union unless steps were taken to make that game more attractive to both play and watch. In the early years of the twentieth century disputes within the New Zealand Rugby Union as to whether to introduce rule changes to make the game more attractive, or to stay with the status quo, had led to division and disharmony. This situation led the promoters of rugby league to be optimistic that their game, once introduced, would quickly replace rugby union as New Zealand's premier winter sport, but they greatly underestimated the hostility they would encounter from rugby union authorities, and this never happened. Investigated in this thesis are the reasons why the high hopes of rugby league's promoters were not fulfilled but how, nevertheless, in the years 1908 to 1920, the game did become established as a working-class sport in parts of the country, particularly the cities of Auckland and Christchurch. Newspapers of the period are used to show where and when league was introduced, where it was, and was not, successful, and to provide evidence of the efforts of rugby union authorities to brand league a professional sport, to threaten its players with banishment from rugby union, to deny league the use of Council owned playing fields, and to deny schoolboys the right to play rugby league at school. Occupations of league players and officials, found from electoral rolls, are used to show that league was an overwhelmingly working-class sport, shunned by the middle-class. The difficulties of establishing the game in small New Zealand towns are related to the geographic and demographic features of the country, and finally, the recovery from the effects of the Great War, which forced most leagues into recess, is shown to owe much to the highly successful postwar tours by international teams from Britain and Australia. Five periods in the development of rugby league are postulated; its introduction in 1908, its near collapse in 1909 and 1910, its expansion during the years 1911 to 1914, the difficulties experienced in the war years 1915 to 1918, and its post-war recovery in 1919 and 1920. The Great War put paid to the real possibility that league would rival union as New Zealand's premier winter team sport, but by 1920 it had recovered sufficiently to become firmly established on the New Zealand sporting scene with its own constituency of players and supporters.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rugby league</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">rugby union</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430101 History: New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/879</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sexual behaviour of international backpackers in the context of travel in Australia</field><field name="creator">Egan, Caroline Elizabeth, National Centre in HIV Social Research, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study is the first to collect detailed empirical data on sexual practice among backpackers while exploring the material and social context of backpacking using an ethnographic framework. The theoretical concepts of liminality and sexual scripts were drawn on to analyse the findings. Backpackers were recruited from hostels in Sydney and Cairns; 559 backpackers (243 women, 316 men) completed an anonymous self-administered questionnaire. In addition, 25 in-depth one-to-one interviews with backpackers and 25 semi-structured interviews were conducted with sexual health and travel clinic staff and hostel service providers. Participant and non-participant observation in backpacker hostels also informed the analysis.  Drinking alcohol, often to excess, was central to the backpacking setting and was both a reason for and a post-facto justification of unprotected sex. The backpacking setting encouraged transient liaisons. More than half (55%) of backpackers had sex with someone new during their trip and for 71% of them it was with someone that they had just met that day. Twenty-five per cent of those with no expectations to have casual sex on their trip and 22% of those with no previous experience of casual sex had casual sex during their trip. More than half (53%) of those who had sex with a someone new did so while other people were in the room. Only 55% always used a condom with their last new partner. While most backpackers carried condoms and intended to use them, unprotected sex was common. Perception of risk was low: 78% of those who did not use a condom the last time they had casual sex on the trip perceived their risk of getting HIV to be ??low?? to ??nil??. Three participants acquired HIV during their trip. The culture of backpacking encourages more sexually permissive attitudes but does not encourage condom use, especially for those who did not consistently use condoms at home. These findings highlight the need for more broad-based dissemination of information on STIs to young people, and for future sexual health campaigns to specifically target backpackers in the context in which they travel.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Backpackers</field><field name="subject">Sex</field><field name="subject">Travel</field><field name="subject">Sexual risk</field><field name="subject">Sexual health</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring and control of the CO2 laser cutting process</field><field name="creator">El-Kurdi, Zeyad, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Laser cutting is one of the most important applications of laser in manufacturing industry; it is mainly used for sheet metal cutting. In laser cutting, performing real-time evaluation of laser cut quality is very important to the advancement of this process in industry. However, due to the dynamic nature of the laser cutting process specially when cutting ferrous alloys using oxygen as an assist gas, laser cut quality cannot be easily predicted; therefore, the quality inspection of the laser cut is performed by off line inspections of the edges of the metal by skilled operators. This methodology is carried out after the process and thus cannot maintain a good quality if the process performance is out of control. Therefore, the objective of the research project is to qualify and develop a sensor system that ensure fault recognition online and can automatically control the laser metal cutting process to achieve good quality cut. For the realization of this objective the following has been done: -	study the relationship between process parameters and cut quality characteristics;  -	identify the best sensors that can be used to monitor the process;  -	design and develop an experimental setup to test the proposed sensors;  -	collect and analyze data from the proposed sensors and correlate them to specific cut quality characteristics (process state variables);  -	develop direct relationships between the process signals and cut quality;  -	develop appropriate strategy for process control;  -	design and develop an integrated monitoring and control system;  -	test and evaluate the proposed system using simulation.  In this study, a new technique for the determination of cut quality of sheet steels under the CO2 laser cutting process has been established. It is based on on-line detection and post-processing analysis of light radiation and acoustic emissions from the cut kerf. Determination of machining quality during cutting is best done through the measurement of surface roughness and kerf widths, as these are the two parameters that vary in successful through cuts. These two quality parameters can further be correlated to the two dominant process parameters of laser power and cutting speed. This study presents an analysis of acoustic emissions and reflected light for CO2 laser cutting of steel plates, and discusses their use for the estimation of cut quality parameters of kerf width and striation frequency for mild steel plates of 3mm, 5mm, 8mm, and 10mm thicknesses. Airborne acoustic and light signals are acquired with a microphone and a photodiode respectively, and recorded with a PC based data acquisition system in real time. The signals are then analyzed to establish a correlation between the signals obtained and the cut quality achieved. Experimental evidence shows that the energy levels of acoustic emission signals (RMS analysis) can be used to maintain the cutting process under steady state condition. On the other hand, the light intensity signal fluctuates with a frequency that corresponds to the frequency of striations formed on the cut surface; therefore it can be used to regulate cutting speed and laser power to obtain an optimum cutting condition and best cut quality. The validity of the proposed control strategy was tested experimentally by simulating the variations of cutting speed and examining their effect on the signals. So far, the prototype used for experimentation has been successful in providing correct information about cut quality in terms of striation frequency, and also about the state of the process where the microphone signal was successful in determining system failure or improper cutting conditions. A microprocessor based control system utilizing the PID control algorithm is recommended for the implementation of the control strategy. The implementation requirements of the proposed system for industrial use are then discussed. A new setup for the coaxial monitoring of CO2 laser cutting using a photodiode is proposed to enhance the quality of the signal and also to protect the photodiode from the harsh cutting environment. It is also proposed that an open control architecture platform is needed to enhance the integration of the proposed process control functions. Conclusions and future research directions towards the achievement of Autonomous Production Cell (APC) for the laser cutting process are then given.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Laser beam cutting</field><field name="subject">Metal-cutting</field><field name="subject">Carbon dioxide lasers</field><field name="subject">Industrial applications.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of amelioration of lipid-induced insulin resistance: role of AMP-activated protein kinase</field><field name="creator">Iglesias, Miguel Angel, University of New South Wales / Garvan Institute of Medical Research. Physiology &amp; Pharmacology, UNSW</field><field name="description">Insulin resistance is an early marker of Type II diabetes. Excessive lipid accumulation in muscle and liver leads to insulin resistance, and lowering tissue lipids causes an enhancement of insulin action. The enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated when cellular energy levels are compromised, such as during exercise; this enhances fuel oxidation and inhibits energy consuming processes. The hypothesis in this thesis was that activating AMPK in a lipid-induced insulin resistant state leads to tissue lipid reduction and improved insulin sensitivity. Insulin resistant high-fat fed (HF-) rats were administered 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-??-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), a specific AMPK activator. During an euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp performed 24h later, HF-rats showed increased whole body, muscle and liver insulin action, independent of changes in PKB-phosphorylation. The liver had reduced triglycerides, malonyl-CoA and increased IkB-a content. A lowering of muscle malonyl-CoA was consistent with conditions favouring increased lipid utilisation. Normal, chow-fed rats also showed improved insulin action post-AICAR. Further studies showed that basal glucose uptake was not increased 24h after AICAR, suggesting that AMPK activation had caused an increase in insulin sensitivity. Diacylglycerols and triglycerides, but not ceramides, were reduced in the liver of AICAR treated HF-rats, suggesting lipid reduction as a likely mediator of enhanced liver insulin action. These lipid species were not reduced in muscle. AICAR administration to HF-rats lowered plasma glucose and fatty acids (FA) acutely, probably due to increased muscle glucose uptake and FA oxidation. Glycogen was reduced in liver and increased in muscle, suggesting glucose mobilisation from liver to muscle. Adrenergic blockade excluded the sympathetic nervous system in the acute AICAR effects. AMPK was activated in white muscle and liver of HF-rats immediately after AICAR, the same tissues that exhibited later improved insulin sensitivity. Tracer technologies used to investigate glucose and lipid fluxes showed that AMPK activation in white muscle simultaneously increased both glucose and FA uptake and their metabolism, with glucose also being stored as glycogen. The liver showed lower lipid synthesis, consistent with reduced liver lipid accumulation observed 24h post-AICAR. In conclusion, these results suggest that activation of AMPK leads to selective tissue lipid reduction and improved insulin action, and is a potential target for the treatment of insulin resistance and type II diabetes.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Insulin resistance</field><field name="subject">diabetes</field><field name="subject">AMPK</field><field name="subject">AMP-activated protein kinase</field><field name="subject">lipid accumulation</field><field name="subject">liver</field><field name="subject">muscle</field><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="subject">amelioration of insulin resistance</field><field name="subject">euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp</field><field name="subject">in vivo studies</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">syndrome X</field><field name="subject">metabolic syndrome</field><field name="subject">protein kinases</field><field name="subject">lipids</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Nation of Sadness? Reading history, culture, and gender in Hou Hsiao-hsien???s A City of Sadness</field><field name="creator">Hung, Christine Yu-Ting, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis engages with Taiwanese history by offering a reading of Hou Hsiaohsien???s A City of Sadness (1989), making reference to the film???s historical dimensions, cultural representations and gender issues in the period 1945 to 1949. In addition, Hou???s cinematography is detailed with comparison to Yasujiro Ozu and the influences of Japanese colonisation. Hou???s immense contribution to Taiwanese film consists principally in a Taiwanese trilogy that traces Taiwan???s history in the 20th century. In The Puppet Master (1993) Hou details the era of Japanese colonisation from 1895 to the restoration of Taiwan by the Kuomintang in 1945. Later, A City of Sadness focuses on the fate of the Lin family from 1945 to 1949, which epitomises people???s life in Taiwan during the initial stages of Kuomintang domination. Finally, Good Men, Good Women (1995) highlights two different eras in Taiwan: the political movement in the 1950s and the pop culture in the 1990s. The thesis uses illustrations from all three films to explore Hou???s historical, cultural and gender representations. In order to understand Hou???s ideology and beliefs in greater depth, I also review his autobiographical film, A Time to Live, and A Time to Die (1985). This thesis examines Taiwan???s indigenous culture and the impact of Japanese and Chinese cultural practices in A City of Sadness through the post-colonial theories of Perry Anderson, Homi Bhabha, and Chris Berry. I draw on their theories of cultural hegemony and my empiricism to investigate Hou???s representation of the political situation in Taiwan. Finally, the thesis evaluates gender issues in A City of Sadness, with reference to Julia Kristeva???s notion of ???feminine time??? and the debate between Emilie Yeh and Mizou concerning ???whether women can really enter history???. In evaluating A City of Sadness I argue that Hou Hsiao-hsien???s use of a family???s microhistory to parallel the national macro-history of the February 28th Incident opens an important historical window through which the audience may re-encounter and reflect on Taiwan???s past, and think positively about its future.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motion pictures - Taiwan - History</field><field name="subject">Women - Taiwan - History</field><field name="subject">Taiwan - History - 1945-</field><field name="subject">Taiwan - Civilization - Japanese influences</field><field name="subject">Taiwan - Civilization - Chinese influences</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluoride Release From Glass Ionomer Cements</field><field name="creator">Turek, S.

The thesis applies soft systems methodologies (SSM) to explore the research question and to develop conceptual models. The theoretical basis for the M&amp;E framework proposed is drawn from a transdisciplinary review of three academic fields: information systems,organisational effectiveness and project management. It is argued that inadequacies in the operationalisation of M&amp;E systems arise from divergent epistemological and ontological assumptions about the nature of information and its role within organisations that are concerned with effecting social change. The M&amp;E framework proposed seeks to resolve the dilemma posed by these divergent assumptions. This involves a M&amp;E information system (i.e.  MEIS) that is novel in terms of its scope, purpose and application. Firstly, the scope of the proposed MEIS takes in the entire aid organisation, going beyond the dominant, conventional approach, which is project-centric.  This enables alignment of project strategies with organisational mission. Further, it aims to promote the institutionalisation of lessons learned within projects (conceived as 'social experiments') for organisational learning, thereby enabling informed debate about the effectiveness of the organisation in fostering sustainable development. Secondly, the purpose of the proposed MEIS has been defined as being concerned with promoting organisational success. The critical success factors of learning and accountability are identified, and the role of M&amp;E in encouraging responsive management decision-making and critical inquiry and reflection is described. Thirdly, the application of the proposed MEIS involves a modified logframe.  The '3D-Logframe' serves as a conceptual basis to address limitations found with the conventional two-dimensional logframe matrix when employed for M&amp;E purposes. The proposed M&amp;E framework was developed out of iterations of action in the field and reflection. Further research will involve applying the framework in its entirety.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Humanitarian assistance.</field><field name="subject">Nonprofit organizations.</field><field name="subject">Economic assistance.</field><field name="subject">Developing countries.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language and Power in Nonprofit/For-Profit Relationships: A Grounded Theory of Inter-sectoral Collaboration</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Concerns over the future of the nonprofit sector due to increasing resource pressures and an economic rationalist political climate in Australia have led to increasing public and private interest in partnerships between nonprofit organisations and the private sector.  The purpose of this research is to describe, understand, map and analyse the experiences of nonprofit staff in organisations that are linked to businesses in a variety of funding relationships. The major questions that drove the research were: 1. Does the language used by nonprofit staff and in organisational documentation relating to relationships with for-profits reflect the status of and contribute to the reproduction of the power relationship between the organisations? 2. Do nonprofit/for-profit relationships affect the organisational capacity of nonprofit organisations and the social agency of individuals? If so, to what extent can balanced power-sharing arrangements contribute to increased organisational capacity? 3. Does the media aspect of the institutional context of relationships in which nonprofits operate affect the social agency of individuals and the capacity of nonprofits? The thesis presents a grounded theory (Glaser &amp; Strauss 1967; Strauss &amp; Corbin 1998) of language and power in inter-sectoral relationships, using five case studies, a media analysis and a quantitative component as the data from which to draw theoretical implications. The work develops an innovative methodological tool called 'linguistic threads' and uses Clegg's circuits of power model (1987) to culminate in static state and process theories of language and power in relationships between nonprofits and for-profits in the Australian context.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nonprofit organizations.</field><field name="subject">Australia.</field><field name="subject">Finance.</field><field name="subject">Business networks.</field><field name="subject">Strategic alliances.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phosphorus removal mechanisms in soil and slag media.</field><field name="creator">Lee, Seung Hwan</field><field name="description">Excessive phosphorus (P) is one of the major pollutants in natural water that are responsible for algal blooms and eutrophication. P removal by soil and slag is an attractive solution if the P sorption capacity of soil or slag is significant. To design an efficient land treatment facility, basic information on the behaviour of P in the media-water environment is required. In this study, detailed experiments were conducted to study P removal under static and dynamic conditions, and mathematical models were developed to describe these processes. The kinetic studies on P sorption onto a sandy loam soil from North Sydney, Australia, and dust and cake waste products from the BHP steel industry revealed that P sorption is a slow process. More than 90% of the P was adsorbed within 70, 12 and 60 hours in a mixing system for soil, dust and cake respectively while it was within 240, 24 and 120 hours respectively in a static (no stirring) system. Dust adsorbed P the most, compared to the other adsorbents (220-225 times and 4-5 times of the sorptivity of soil and cake respectively). P sorption in the batch experiments was described better by an equation using the Langmuir isotherm than one using the Freundlich isotherm. The kinetics of P sorption were satisfactorily explained by a static, physical, non-equilibrium sorption model (SPNSM). The pH of the P solution played a critical role in the extent of removal and the removal mechanisms of P. Removal was at a minimum at pH 2. The effect of pH on P removal varied depending on the type of adsorbents and the initial P concentration. The dominant removal mechanism of P at pH&lt;8 was physical sorption, while it was chemical precipitation at pH&gt;10. Batch flocculation experiments revealed that the P removal efficiency increased with an increase of adsorbent dose, flocculation (contact) time and mixing rate. P sorption is affected by the presence of NH4 which competes for available sites on the adsorbents. The amount of P adsorbed by dust and cake in the presence of NH4 was less than that in a single solute system. The reduction percentage of P for dust ranged from 33 to 57%. Detailed column experiments conducted with soil, dust and cake as media indicated that dust and cake have much higher sorption capacities than soil. The solid phase P concentrations on dust and cake calculated from batch experimental isotherm constants are substantially higher than those estimated.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phosphorus.</field><field name="subject">Soils.</field><field name="subject">Slag.</field><field name="subject">Algal blooms.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BlackBOX : painting a digital picture of documented memory.</field><field name="creator">Pentes, Tatiana</field><field name="description">This study investigates and records the production of a digital media artwork blackBOX: Painting A Digital Picture of Documented Memory, generated through the media technologies of interactive multimedia, exploiting the creative potentials of digitally produced music, sound, image and text relationships in a disc based and  online (Internet) environment. The artwork evolves from an imaginary electronic landscape that can be uniquely explored/ played in a non-sequential manner. The artwork/ &#8216;game&#8217; is a search for the protagonist Nina&#8217;s hybrid cultural identity. This is mirrored in the exploration of random, fragmentary and non-linear experiences designed for the player engaged with the artwork. The subjective intervention of the player/ participant in the electronic artwork is metaphoric of the improvisational tendencies that have evolved in the Greek Blues (Rembetika), Jazz, and Hindustani musical and performative dance forms. The protagonist Nina&#8217;s discovery of these musical forms reveal her cultural/ spiritual origins. As a musical composer arranges notes, melodies and harmonies, and sections of instruments, so too, the multimedia producer designs a ensemble of audio-visual fragments to be navigated. Dance also becomes a driving metaphor, analogous to the players movement in and through these passages of image/ sound/ text and as a movement between theories and ideas explored in the content of the program. The central concern is to playfully reverse, obscure, distort the look of the dominating/colonialist gaze, in the production of an interactive &#8216;game&#8217; and allow the girl to picture herself.

This characteristic differentiates these Igs from monoreactive Igs which bind to a single antigen, usually with high specificity and affinity. Chronic B lymphocytic leukaemia (B CLL) is a malignancy identified by the incessant accumulation, in the peripheral circulation, of B lymphocytes of a mature and resting morphology. B CLL malignant cells generally express both surface IgM and the pan T cell antigen CD5. Moreover, the IgM on the surface of these CD5 positive B CLL cells is frequently polyreactive. This thesis examines the structural diversity found in the combining sites of B CLL derived Igs in an attempt to elucidate the structural basis of polyreactive antigen binding displayed by a significant proportion of human Igs. The genes encoding the variable (V) domains of five B CLL derived IgM antibodies (Bel, Tre, Yar, Hod and Jak) were cloned and sequenced (Chapter Two). When the light chain V domain genes were aligned with the closest germline VL and JL coding DNA sequences it was determined that there was either a complete absence of somatic mutation (Tre, Yar and Jak) or a minimal number of mutations (Bel and Hod) present in the rearranged VL domain genes. A remarkable fidelity in the splicing of VL to JL genes was noted suggesting that the diversity, normally introduced through variability of splicing VL to JL, is reduced in Igs expressed by B CLL cells. Furthermore, the markedly reduced primary structural diversity was highlighted when two of the VL domain genes (Yar and Hod) were found to be different in sequence by only four nucleotides and two amino acids. The heavy chain V domain genes of the same five Igs were sequenced in another study (Brock, 1995), however, it was interesting to analyse the sequences of the VH domain genes and compare them with the VL domain genes. The naive or gerrnline nature of the B CLL antibodies was reflected in the VH genes by either an absence or a low frequency of mutations within these sequences compared with germline immunoglobulin gene sequences. No obvious conserved motif, which could be related to polyreactivity, was observed when the primary protein sequence was analysed for distribution of identical or similar amino acids. Thus, homology modelling was used to construct three-dimensional models of the Fv (VL-VH) portions of the five B CLL IgM molecules to examine the structures of the combining sites of these Igs (Chapter Three). Framework regions were constructed using X-ray coordinates taken from highly hon~ologous human variable domain structures. Complementarity determining regions (CDR) were predicted by grafting loops, taken from known Ig structures, onto the Fv framework models. The CDR templates were selected, where possible, to be of the same length and of high residue identity or similarity. If a single template CDR was not appropriate to model a particular CDR the loop was built from loop sterns of known conformation, followed by chain closure with a p-turn. Template models were refined using standard molecular mechanics simulations. The binding sites were either relatively flat or contained a deep cavity at the VL-VH domain interface. Further differences in topology were the result of some CDR loops protruding into the solvent. Examination of the electrostatic molecular surface did not reveal a common structural feature within the binding sites of the five polyreactive Fv. While two of the binding cavities were positively charged the other three structures displayed either negatively charged or predominantly hydrophobic combining sites. These findings suggested that a diversity of structural mechanisms are involved in polyreactive antigen binding. Rcsidues within CDRs which have  aromatic side-chains and are partially exposed to solvent were distributed across large regions of the combining sites. It is possible that these aromatic residues are responsible for the conserved binding to mouse Igs observed (Chapter Two) for the B CLL derived polyreactive IgM molecules. Two Fv molecules (Be1 and Tre) were cloned as dicistronic constructs, into the bacterial expression vector pFLAG. The expression of the Fvs was fully characterised and unfortunately the VL and VH of Be1 and Tre Igs did not associate in an appropriate manner to yield large quantities of purified Fv (Chapter Four). Expression of correctly folded and stabilised fragments of human polyreactive immunoglobulins would enable the structural basis for the polyreactive binding phenomenon to be fully explored using protein crystallography.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">immunoglobulins</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">polyreactive</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CDMA systems using zero correlation zone codes</field><field name="creator">Conti, Peter G.</field><field name="description">Zero-Correlation-Zone (ZCZ) codes differ from traditional spreading codes because they contain a region in their correlation functions where the correlation values are null.

Yet, ordinary people frequently encounter the informal application of aspects of probability in daily-life situations that require decision-making under uncertainty, understanding of random behaviour and consideration of likelihood. With the purpose of discovering more about children&#8217;s &#8216;natural&#8217; probability strategies, in a particular part of the world, task-based interviews were conducted with 74 children aged four to twelve years from three schools. These children had not received any formal instruction in probability, as it was not part of their school curriculum. The children&#8217;s interaction with games involving random generators prompted a range of intuitive strategies for making probabilistic judgments. These invented strategies are related to the development of proportional reasoning, but are also interlaced with the development of understanding of randomness. Examination of the strategies revealed an age-related hierarchy of sophistication of reasoning and mathematical precision. The study confirmed the presence of three developmental stages, but also revealed two distinct transitional stages not reported in previous research. The characteristics of children&#8217;s thinking at each stage of development provide a further research on probabilistic thinking and contribute to planning for teaching.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">probabilities</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="subject">learning, psychology of</field><field name="subject">child psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/23279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 'film' on whiteness : depicting white trash in U.S. film, 1972-2002</field><field name="creator">Cunningham, Daniel</field><field name="description">This thesis examines various aspects of whiteness and white trash as it relates to films made between 1972 and 2002. Key to this discussion are the concepts of race and class because whiteness invokes race, and trash invokes class. How is white trash represented in cinema? To begin answering this question, one must call into question a conceptual framework of 'privileged whiteness' because when upper-middle-class whiteness is forced to recognise itself, a crisis occurs whereby whiteness can become trashed. This thesis argues from the outset that little distance exists between privileged whiteness and white trash because this ongoing 'crisis' maintains a proximity between both terms. The sopmetimes difficult relationship between privileged whiteness and white trash is explored in filmic case studies. A discussion of white trash must go beyond race and class, because place, age and sexuality also play a large part in making sense of the way white trash functions on screen. The second half of the work identifies specific modes of cinematic white trash production. These are camp white trash and queer white trash. In the former, the films of John Waters are discussed within a framework of 'camp/trash aesthetics'. The latter looks at queer white trash through a detailed analysis of the 1990's New Queer Cinema. Lastly, this thesis argues that the films discussed contribute to a concept of White Trash Cinema.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">whites in motion pictures</field><field name="subject">race relations in motion pictures</field><field name="subject">social problems in motion pictures</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/24591</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Demography and movement patterns of a population of eastern snake-necked turtles, Chelodina longicollis (Shaw, 1794)</field><field name="creator">Dalem, Anak Agung Gde Raka</field><field name="description">With 226-343 individual/ha, population density of Chelodina longicollis in the dams of the University of Western Sydney-Hawkesbury Richmond campus were in the range of other studies around Australia. Their size extremes (24.3 -223.3 mm) were within the range of previous studies, and the overall sex ratio was skewed toward males. The annual growth rates varied and were weakly correlated with animal size. Scute shedding occurred between September and April and peaked in December. Turtles were generally in excellent condition, indicating that sufficient food resources were available in local habitats. Only 3.4% of the population were in poor condition and few animals (8.8 %) carried signs of past injury. No gross abnormalities were recorded, however, there has been low levels of recruitment to the population compared with other Australian studies. Despite a maximum distance dams sampled of 2.8 km and ample evidence of interchange between dams, there was a great variation in animal size, cohort structure, sex ratio among dams. There are a range of factors which have the potential to bias sampling results. Turtles were not influenced by a dominance hierarchy or by the presence of eels, however, they appeared to be capable of avoidance behaviour when nets are set at a specific location. Different cohorts were caught differentially and this varied with month, season and year. In addition, catchability varied among cohorts. Juveniles were least likely, and sub-adult males were most likely, to be recaptured. In some dams there was evidence that animals moved at random while in others movement did not conform to this pattern.

This essay explores the way in which the author's research papers and the pedagogical materials that they have generated have supported and indeed to some extent been instrumental in bringing about these changes. Beginning with an overview of literature teaching in secondary schools 1990, the essay identifies the questions which have driven the research over the past decade: 1/. Can Reader-Response Theory be made explicit to junior and middle secondary students? Would such knowledge be of value to them? 2/. Are there other aspects of modern literary theory that are worth exploring with secondary students? 3/. Can young readers be encouraged to reflect on their processes of response? Is such an endeavour worthwhile? 4/. How can the teaching of Shakespeare be improved? The last question led the author, during the period of candidature, to explore the puzzling question of why the pedagogy of teaching Shakespeare had lagged so far behind the methods employed in the teaching of other literature, and thus to an historical enquiry covering the teaching of Shakespeare over the past hundred years. At the same time, the author has been concerned to refine some of his teaching methods in order to encourage senior students to explore the plays from, for example, feminist, new historicist and post-colonial perspectives.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shakespeare</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">secondary literary curriculum</field><field name="subject">literary theory</field><field name="subject">secondary students</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/788</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond cultural diversity : exploring micro and macro culture in the early childhood setting</field><field name="creator">De Gioia, Katey</field><field name="description">Experiences in the early years of life are increasingly recognised as significant predictors of long-term cognitive and psychosocial behaviour.

For the first time in history there may be more babies aged 0-3 years in care situations than babies who are cared for at home - this impacts upon the child&#8217;s micro-culture (individual, unconscious practices guided by beliefs, norms and values) and macro-culture (ritualistic, symbolic behaviour, often conscious which is tied to belonging to an ethnic group). This study investigates the way in which child care centres contribute to the development of micro and macro-cultural identity in very young children. This study was originally designed to increase the knowledge base about the ways in which interactions with children (particularly in relation to sleep and feeding micro-cultural practices) differ between home and child care service and the implications of these differing practices. As the study progressed a new focus was developed and evolved into an analysis of communication processes between parents and staff and the effects of those communication processes. Qualitative methods on non-participant observation, semi-structured interviews and semi-structured questionnaires were used to address the research questions. Recommendations from the study focus on setting level and policy issues. The early childhood sector is called on to redress notions around communication and partnership building with parents</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cultural diversity</field><field name="subject">child care centres</field><field name="subject">children of immigrants</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/795</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The intuitive and the intellectual : aspects of personal compositional voice and its complex and intuitive processes in relation to astronomical observations and elementary and advanced performers</field><field name="creator">Clark, Stephen J.</field><field name="description">This dissertation explores the complex and intuitive elements of the author&#8217;s musical compositions. It investigates the concept of a composer&#8217;s &#8216;compositional voice&#8217; by looking at the aesthetic and compositional techniques that are used to express it. In particular, it looks at the author&#8217;s expression of astronomy through his music, along with its realisation through both advanced and elementary performers. The aesthetic is examined by looking at astronomy and its relation to music. It observes the intricate ways that concepts to do with astronomy can be expressed through music, as well as the instinctive act of self-expression that arises from emotionally engaging with these astronomical concepts. The techniques used by the author to express these aesthetical ideas are generally found to be either complex or intuitive, and in turn can result in music that is difficult or simple. The complex techniques are found to be mostly process-based, using canons and subtractive and additive repetition in a similar manner to Olivier Messiaen, Steve Reich and Gy&#246;rgy Ligeti. The intuitive techniques are made of instinctive creative decisions and use elements of performer improvisation and aleatory. The performer is the physical manifestation of the compositional voice; this relationship is developed through the application of both advanced and elementary performer techniques are used to reflect the author&#8217;s engagement with complexity and intuition. Due to their advanced technique, the advanced performer is found to be especially fit to realise the multilayered processes. These processes are used by composer Brian Ferneyhough, who appears to use the notion of &#8216;difficulty&#8217;, especially in terms of notation, as being an aesthetic technique itself. Other composers, including Johann Sebastian Bach, B&#233;la Bart&#243;k and Benjamin Britten have written music for elementary performers. Furthermore, Britten and Peter Maxwell Davies have also written pieces for ensembles that include both advanced and elementary performers. All of these pieces that involve elementary performers have generally been found to be written either with the intention of being a didactic tool or with the intention of contributing to the composer&#8217;s immediate community. The aim in my aesthetic, however, is to combine the complex and intuitive aesthetic with both advanced and elementary performers towards a compositional voice that can embrace the elementary within complex processes. In short, the music aims towards being not only a service to the community but also an elementary-complex compositional voice capable of being relevant to the composer&#8217;s astronomy-related aesthetic. An analysis of the author&#8217;s compositions reveals evidence of the collaboration between complexity and intuition in the astronomy-related aesthetic, which is complexly realised in Messier 7 and intuitively realised in Stellar Meditations and Celestial Dances. It can also be found in the complex techniques in Celestial Shadows and the intuitive techniques used in the first two movements of Pale Blue Dot, and the interaction between the elementary and advanced performers that occurs in the IONS suite.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">composition (music)</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">philosophy and aesthetics</field><field name="subject">vocal music</field><field name="subject">astronomy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/38730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Sex Pistols and the London mob</field><field name="creator">Kitson, Michael E.</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns the invention, improvisation, and right to ownership of the punk patent and questions the contention, put by the band&#8217;s manager, Malcolm McLaren, and other commentators, that the Sex Pistols and English punk were a Situationist prank. This challenge to what, in the majority of punk literature, has become an &#8216;accepted truth&#8217; was first raised by McLaren&#8217;s nemesis, the band&#8217;s lead singer, John Lydon. McLaren and Lydon did agree that the London punk movement took its inspiration from the anarchic and chaotic energies of the eighteenth&#8211;century London mob. This common crowd could switch instantly and unpredictably from a passive state to an anarchic, violent and destructive mob, or &#8216;King Mob&#8217;: one that turned all authority on its head in concerted, but undirected, acts of misrule. Through his own improvisation with punk tropes, Lydon came to embody English punk and functioned, on the one hand, as a natural mob leader; and on the other, as a focus for the mob&#8217;s anger. I argue that, in following McLaren&#8217;s reduction of the Sex Pistols to a Situationistinspired prank, one of the earliest and most influential analyses of the punk phenomenon, Greil Marcus&#8217;s Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century, misunderstood how fundamental the culture and semiotics of the London mob was to McLaren, Lydon, the Sex Pistols and the performance of London punk. I take seriously, then, the idea that the cultural signifiers the Sex Pistols drew upon to make their punk performances, and which accounted in no small way for their ability to &#8216;outrage&#8217;, were exclusively British and unique to London&#8217;s cultural topography and the culture of the London crowd. After the implosion of the Sex Pistols on their 1978 American tour, with Lydon quitting in disgust, McLaren attempted to take ownership of the punk legacy: both actually, through attempting to assert his copyright over the Sex Pistols&#8217; brand; and symbolically through re-writing the Sex Pistols&#8217; story in his 1980 movie The Great Rock &#8216;n&#8217; Roll Swindle. Curiously, and most notably, the mob is foregrounded in the film through its opening sequence, which draws heavily from the events of the Gordon Riots in 1780. This thesis contests the paradigm put in place by McLaren&#8217;s version of events as portrayed in The Great Rock &#8216;n&#8217; Roll Swindle and reconsiders punk as a cultural object trouve. In particular, I consider literary influences on its protagonists: Graham Greene on John Lydon and Charles Dickens and J. M. Barrie on Malcolm McLaren.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sex Pistols (musical group)</field><field name="subject">punk rock music</field><field name="subject">rock groups</field><field name="subject">mobs</field><field name="subject">London (England)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/38784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of the new "econophysics" approach to dealing with problems of financial to traditional econometric methods</field><field name="creator">Koh, Jason S. H.</field><field name="description">We begin with the outlining the motivation of this research as there are still so many unanswered research questions on our complex financial and economic systems. The philosophical background and the advances of econometrics and econophysics are discussed to provide an overview of the stochastic and nonstochastic modelling and these disciplines are set as a central theme for the thesis. This thesis investigates the effectiveness of financial econometrics models such as Gaussian, ARCH (1), GARCH (1, 1) and its extensions as compared to econophysics models such as Power Law model, Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) and Tsallis Entropy as statistical models of volatility in US S&amp;P500, Dow Jones and NASDAQ stock index using daily data. The data demonstrate several distinct behavioural characteristics, particularly the increased volatility during 1998 to 2004. Power Laws appear to describe the large fluctuations and other characteristics of stock price changes. Surprisingly, these Power Laws models also show significant correlations for different types and sizes of markets and for different periods and sub-periods of markets. The results show the robustness of Power Law analysis, with the Power Law exponent (0.4 to 2.4) staying within the acceptable range of significance (83% to 97%), regardless of the percentage change in the index return. However, the procedure for testing empirical data against a hypothesised power-law distribution using a simple rank-frequency plot of the data and the data binning process can turn out to be a spurious result for the distribution. As for the stochastic processes such as ARCH (1) and GARCH (1, 1) the models are explicitly confined to the conditional behaviour of the data and the unconditional behaviour has often been described via moments. In reality, it is the unconditional tail behaviour that accounts for the tail behaviour and hence, we have to convert the unconditional tail behaviour and express the models as two-dimensional stochastic difference equation using the processes of Starica (Mikosch 2000). The results show the random walk prediction successfully describes the stock movements for small price fluctuations but fails to handle large price fluctuations. The Power Law tests prove superior to the stochastic tests when stock price fluctuations are substantially divergent from the mean. One of the main points of the thesis is that these empirical phenomena are not present in the stochastic process but emerge in the non-parametric process. The main objective of the thesis is to study the relatively new field of Econophysics and put its work in perspective relative to the established if not altogether successful practice of econometric analysis of stock market volatility. One of the most exciting characteristics of Econophysics is that, as a developing field, no models as yet perfectly represent the market and there is still a lot of fundamental research to be done. Therefore, we begin to explore the application of statistical physics method particularly Tsallis entropy to give a new insights into problems traditionally associated with financial markets. The results of Tsallis entropy surpass all expectations and it is therefore one of the most robust methods of analysis. However, it is now subject to some challenge from McCauley, Bassler et. al., as they found that the stochastic dynamic process (sliding interval techniques) used in fat tail distributions is time dependent.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">econometrics</field><field name="subject">finance</field><field name="subject">statistical methods</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">statistical physics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/38828</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effectiveness of occupational therapy home program intervention for children with cerebral palsy : a double blind randomised controlled trial</field><field name="creator">Novak, Iona</field><field name="description">Home programs are widely used by occupational therapists as a strategy to address health and development needs of children with cerebral palsy. Experts believe they are essential. Despite wide-spread clinical use there is no high quality research evidence proving home program effectiveness. Further there is no information that provides a parent perspective on home programs. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of occupational therapy home program intervention for school-aged children with cerebral palsy and identify factors perceived to be important in home program practice from a parent perspective. A double blind randomised controlled trial design was used to evaluate effectiveness, where parents and evaluators were blinded to intervention. Children were randomised to three groups, home program intervention for eight weeks (&#8220;8WEEKS&#8221;), home program intervention for four weeks (&#8220;4WEEKS&#8221;), and a control group, that did not receive home program intervention (&#8220;NoHP&#8221;). The primary end-point was change in performance of functional activities and satisfaction with function as measured by the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), after eight weeks. Secondary endpoints were change in COPM scores after four weeks, goal achievement at four and eight weeks as measured by Goal Attainment Scale (GAS), quality of arm movement at four and eight weeks measured on the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST) and participation levels at four and eight weeks measured on the Children&#8217;s Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment (CAPE). Parent experience was explored through semistructured interviews of parents who participated in the home program trial. Content analysis of interview data was conducted to the level of &#8220;open coding&#8221; to identify factors. Results for the primary outcome measure at the primary end point (eight weeks) - Effect of an 8WEEK or 4WEEK home program on COPM scores: comparison between the three groups was conducted using a linear regression model with baseline COPM performance/satisfaction scores, participant age and severity of cerebral palsy as measured by the GMFCS entered into the model as covariates. Overall, there were statistically significant and clinically important differences in performance of activities and satisfaction with function on COPM when comparing either home program group to the NoHP group at eight weeks. There was no difference between 4WEEKS versus 8WEEKS on COPM performance or satisfaction scores at eight weeks. Results on secondary outcome measures: compared to NoHP, receiving a home program for either 4WEEKs or 8WEEKs increased COPM performance scores and GAS measures at four weeks, and increased COPM performance and satisfaction scores, GAS measures, and QUEST scores at eight weeks. There were no differences within or between groups on the CAPE at either four week or eight weeks. There were no statistically significant between-group differences between the 4WEEK and 8WEEK home program groups on any secondary outcome measures. This was most likely the result of a protocol implementation flaw that occurred in the study where 4WEEK group participants continued program activity for the final four weeks when they should have suspended it. Parents perceived their experience of implementing home programs as characterised by five features: &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;guidance for the journey&#8221;, practice makes perfect, they were a necessary &#8220;way of life&#8221;, they maximised progress and something that made it easier to juggle competing demands. Positive home program experiences were characterised by: support, realistic expectations, flexibility, motivation from goals, activities that translated to real-life, reminders to practice, progress updates and role clarity. Parents advised other parents to: accept the disability, never refuse help, be honest, consider home programs essential, develop routines and view programs as a way of improving the child and parents&#8217; life. No negative experiences were reported. Parents advised professionals that they wanted: support, interdisciplinary co-ordination of programs, advice without pressure and prognostic guidance for future planning. This dissertation presents new information about occupational therapy home programs. Until this study, there was little research evidence to inform therapist or parent decision-making regarding the therapeutic value of home programs or the parent perspective on home programs. Findings from this dissertation can inform clinical practice and parent decisions regarding the use of home program interventions for children with cerebral palsy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cerebral palsied children</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">home care</field><field name="subject">occupational therapy for children</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/38884</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating new product development performance in small to medium sized manufacturing firms</field><field name="creator">O'Mara, Charles Edward</field><field name="description">The purpose of the research undertaken for this thesis was to examine management practices relating to new product development processes in small to medium-sized manufacturing firms (SMEs). The thesis topic has its origins in a European Community funded research project carried out during 1997-9 and designated CIMA (Continuous Improvement in Global Innovation Management) ESPRIT project 26056. The CIMA project had as its objective the development, testing and dissemination of a methodology to support knowledge transfer in the product innovation process. The CIMA model suggested a relationship between management behaviours and performance outcomes that used literature from a variety of research areas including continuous improvement, product innovation, performance measurement, and inter-project learning. This literature was centred largely on research undertaken in large organisations, with little information available on the new product development (NPD) practices in SMEs.  This thesis sought to examine the management of NPD activities in SMEs across a range of important variables as identified in larger organisations in an effort to evaluate whether they were as relevant in smaller organisations. The literature review reduced the research to four broad questions: 1.what is the relationship between a business unit&#8217;s competitive strategy and its new product development strategy, 2.how management involvement in improving NPD performance, 3.does a more systematic approach to management of NPD projects would lead to better outcomes, and finally 4.how new product development performance is measured in SMEs. A two-stage, field based research methodology was used to gather data for this thesis. Firstly, a quantitative survey instrument was used to collect data across a broad range of variables. The data thus gathered were supported by a subsequent set of interviews in three SMEs that. In each of these firms, employees from the broad functional areas of sales, operations, and design, were interviewed to gain a greater understanding of the issues that might emerge in the quantitative survey. Thematic analysis was used to examine the qualitative data. Descriptive statistics, in the main were used to evaluate the quantitative data. Findings relevant to each of the research questions provide valuable insights into NPD practices in SMEs. For instance, strategies tend to be hazy, and have a short term emphasis. The qualitative interviews in particular showed a lack of certainty and direction when it came to strategy. With regard to management involvement, there was more emphasis on individual effort rather than team-based activities. Managers tended not to look for external sources to improve their NPD performance. The approach taken in managing NPD activities, whether it was systematic or informal, did not appear to affect innovativeness, though it did appear to impact other variables such as time-to-market. Finally, performance measurement in SMEs tended to emphasise cost outcomes as opposed to variables critical to customers such as conformance quality or time-to-market. Further, outcomes in those performance dimensions did not appear to influence future strategy or actions within the organisations. A detailed review of the data is provided in chapters five, six and seven.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">new products</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">technological innovations</field><field name="subject">product management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/38926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The integration of nature conservation and community development in Nepal's protected natural areas and buffer zones</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Robert J.</field><field name="description">This thesis has endeavoured to enhance the knowledge and effectiveness of integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) as a model for the management of conservation areas and the buffer zones to national parks and reserves in Nepal. ICDPs evolved as it was recognised that the Western model of protected natural area management imposed costs on poor rural communities in developing countries and often failed to achieve nature conservation objectives. The ICDP concept was questioned when, after many years of mostly development effort in several developing countries, ICDPs did not provide an appropriate contribution to nature conservation. An ICDP in Nepal that provided considerable benefit to local people and greatly enhanced nature conservation is provided to establish that the ICDP concept is valid. The question that initiated this research was why some ICDPs fail to contribute to nature conservation while others are successful. The ICDP process is based on the assumption that the welfare of people who rely on resources from within protected natural areas is central to the pursuit of nature conservation and has priority in that nature conservation objectives can only be achieved where the wellbeing of local people and their access to the resources they require has been assured. The establishment of a nature conservation estate in developing countries is both an ecological problem and a social problem. The social problem is one of poverty. ICDPs in Nepal&#8217;s protected natural areas have been studied using qualitative research methods and a contextual constructionist approach that is central to the study of social problems. The evidence suggests that ICDP agencies have accepted assumptions that sustainable development and poverty alleviation will lead to the conservation of biodiversity. This thesis argues that sustainable resource use can not ensure the conservation of biodiversity yet paradoxically the sustainable use of resources in one place may lead to biodiversity conservation in more remote places where human impact is minimal. The variables associated with different settings are such that the outcomes of interventions designed to achieve ICDP objectives are not always predictable. The research suggests that assumptions about the outcomes of interventions should be treated with caution. Monitoring interventions can help ensure the desired outcomes are achieved but ICDP intervention monitoring in Nepal has been neglected. Numerous reports and evaluations detail input and effort rather than outcomes. The results include a recommendation to apply the principles of action research and adoption of a structured process for monitoring and evaluation of progress towards clearly stated objectives for the project and for individual interventions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">conservation of natural resources</field><field name="subject">Nepal</field><field name="subject">community development</field><field name="subject">buffer zones (ecosystem management)</field><field name="subject">protected areas</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/38992</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Removal of ammonia from drinking water by biological nitrification in a fixed film reactor</field><field name="creator">van den Akker, Ben</field><field name="description">The absence of water catchment protection often results in contamination of drinking water supplies. Waters in South East Asia have been exploited to support extensive agriculture, industry, power generation, public water supply, fisheries and recreation use. Ammonia has been identified as a significant contaminant of drinking water because of its ability to affect the disinfection efficiency of chlorine. The interference of ammonia with chlorination is a prevalent and expensive problem faced by many water treatment plants (WTPs) located throughout South East Asia. The conventional approach for ammonia removal was to pre-chlorinate using high concentrations of chlorine, which has a number of disadvantages including the formation of disinfection by-products and high chlorine consumption.

This thesis investigated the application of high rate nitrifying trickling filters (NTFs) as a means of ammonia removal from a polluted lowland water source as an alternative to pre-chlorination. NTFs are widely used for the biological remediation of ammonia rich wastewater, however their performance when required to operate under low ammonia concentrations for potable water applications was unknown. 
A NTF pilot facility consisting of one large-scale, and three small-scale NTFs were constructed at Hope Valley WTP in South Australia. The NTFs were operated to simulate the raw water quality of a polluted catchment identified in Indonesia (Buaran WTP), including variations in ammonia, biological oxygen demand (BOD5), and turbidity. Results confirmed that plastic-packed NTFs were able to operate equally successfully under low ammonia-N concentrations, some 10- to 50-fold lower that that of conventional wastewater applications, where complete conversion of ammonia to nitrate was consistently observed under these markedly reduced loadings. Results also showed that when operated under mass loads equivalent to typical ammonia loading criteria for wastewater NTFs, by increasing hydraulic flow&#172;, comparable apparent nitrification rates were achieved. These results confirmed that mass transport limitations posed by low ammonia-N concentrations on overall filter performance were insignificant.
This thesis also investigated the impact of organic carbon quantity and biodegradability on the nitrification behaviour of the pilot NTF. Results demonstrated that organic carbon loading, rather than the C:N ratio, was an important regulator of filter nitrification capacity, where a linear decline in nitrification performance correlated well with sucrose and methanol augmented carbon loads. Extensive monitoring of inorganic nitrogen species down the NTF, to profile nitrification behaviour, showed sucrose-induced carbon loads greater than 870 mg sBOD5 m&#150;2 d&#150;1 severely suppressed nitrification throughout the entire filter bed. This study also confirmed that critical carbon loads for nitrification varied among carbon sources. In contrast to sucrose, when a more native-like carbon source was dosed (organic fertiliser), no significant decline in nitrification capacity was observed. This could be attributed to differences in carbon biodegradability.

This research has provided new insights into the microbial ecology of a potable water NTF. The combination of fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for in situ analysis of biofilms was successful in identifying the spatial distribution of ammonia oxidising bacteria (AOB), nitrite oxidising bacteria (NOB) and heterotrophs. When the NTF was operated under low organic loads, clusters of AOB and NOB were abundant, and were located in close proximity to each other. Uniquely, the study identified not only Nitrospira spp but also the less common Nitrobacter spp within the NTF biofilm. Biofilm analysis showed that the type of carbon source also strongly influenced the biofilms characteristics in terms of biomass ecology, morphology, and polysaccharide composition, which was correlated with NTF performance. Results showed that an increase in sBOD5 via the addition of sucrose promoted the rapid growth of filamentous heterotrophic bacteria and production of large amounts of polysaccharide. Stratification of nitrifiers and heterotrophs, and high biofilm polysaccharide concentrations were observed at all filter bed depths, which coincided with the impediment of nitrification throughout the entire filter column. High biofilm polysaccharide concentrations also coincided with a significant increase (40 %) in filter hydraulic retention time, as determined by hydraulic tracer experiments. In contrast to sucrose-fed biofilms, organic fertiliser-fed biofilms had a more uniform and dense ultra-structure dominated by many rod shaped bacteria, and was significantly lower in polysaccharide composition. This observation was coupled with superior nitrification performance.

This study confirmed that a well functioning NTF is a viable, low cost alternative for ammonia removal from source water abstracted from poorly protected catchments found in many developing countries. Pre-treatment using NTFs has the potential to reduce the chlorine dose required for pre-chlorination. Thereby improving water quality by minimising the formation of disinfection by-products, and improving the control of chlorination. NTFs could also find ready application in other situations where ammonia interferes with chlorine disinfection.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nitrification</field><field name="subject">trickling filter</field><field name="subject">potable water</field><field name="subject">South East Asia</field><field name="subject">ammonia removal</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090623.160149</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gastro-oesophageal reflux in obstructive sleep apnoea : prevalence and mechanisms</field><field name="creator">Shepherd, Kelly</field><field name="description">Background. Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) is associated with an increase in nocturnal gastro-oesophageal reflux (nocturnalGOR) events and symptoms, however the mechanism for this remains undefined. Treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been shown to reduce nocturnalGOR in individuals with OSA however the reasons for this reduction are not clear. The combination of OSA and nocturnalGOR could be particularly problematic for individuals who have had a lung transplant in whom Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) limits survival. It is thought that GOR plays a role in the development of BOS in these individuals. Methods and Results. Five interrelated studies were undertaken. The first two studies sought to determine and compare the prevalence and risk factors of nocturnalGOR in OSA patients with the general population. To do this, a GOR questionnaire was completed by 2,042 members of the general community as part of the Busselton Health Survey and by 1,116 patients with polysomnography-diagnosed OSA. Risk of OSA in the general population was determined using a standardised sleep questionnaire. 137 of the OSA patients completed the questionnaire before and after treatment with CPAP. The prevalence of nocturnalGOR symptoms reported more than once a week (frequent symptoms) was greater in OSA patients (10.1%) than the general population (5.8%) (p&lt;0.001), in individuals from the general population at high (11.2%) than low risk of OSA (4.5%) (p&lt;0.001) and in patients with severe (14.7%) than mild OSA (5.2%) (p&lt;0.001). Treatment of OSA with CPAP decreased the prevalence of frequent nocturnalGOR from 9.0% to 3.8% (p=0.04). In the general population, high risk of OSA was independently associated with a 2.4-fold increased risk of frequent ABSTRACT vi nocturnalGOR symptoms than low risk. In the OSA group, disease severity was independently associated with nocturnalGOR symptoms, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.7 for frequent nocturnalGOR symptoms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sleep apnea syndromes -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Gastroesophageal reflux</field><field name="subject">Respiratory organs -- Obstructions</field><field name="subject">obstructive sleep apnoea</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0085</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Suppression of the asthmatic phenotype in mice by UVB irradiation</field><field name="creator">McGlade, Jacqueline Patricia</field><field name="description">Background: Exposure of skin to UVB radiation (290-320 nm) modulates the immune system, with most studies showing a suppression of Th1-driven immune responses. Investigations into the effects of UVB exposure on allergic respiratory responses have been limited. This study investigated the systemic effects of UVB on Th2-associated immune responses using two different murine models of allergic respiratory inflammation. The mechanism of immune regulation was also examined. Methods and Results: Two murine models of asthma were used: the papain model and the ovalbumin (OVA) model using papain and OVA, respectively, as the allergens. In the papain model, C57BL/6, histamine receptor-1 knockout (H1RKO) and histamine receptor-2 knockout (H2RKO) mice were exposed to a single 4 kJ/m2 dose of UVB (twice a minimal oedemal dose) on shaved dorsal skin three days prior to intranasal sensitisation with papain, a cysteine protease homologue of the house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) allergen Der p 1. Sensitisation and boost each consisted of five daily intranasal doses of 1 &#181;g papain whilst the challenge consisted of three daily intranasal doses of 100 &#181;g papain. Asthmatic symptoms were assessed 24 h after the final challenge dose. H1RKO mice demonstrated enhanced papain-specific inflammatory responses in the lung-draining lymph nodes (LDLNs) whilst the responses of H2RKO mice closely mimicked those of C57BL/6 mice. UVB irradiation three days before sensitisation reduced in vitro papain-specific proliferation of LDLN cells from C57BL/6 and H1RKO mice but not H2RKO mice 24 h after challenge. The regulatory effect of UVB was transferred by adoptive transfer of 5 x 106 unfractionated LDLN cells from UVB-irradiated, papain-sensitised and -challenged C57BL/6 and H1RKO donor mice into na&#239;ve recipients of the corresponding strain that were ii subsequently sensitised and challenged with papain. Additionally, UVB exposure suppressed papain-induced IL-5 and IL-10 production in vitro by LDLN cells from H1RKO mice but not from C57BL/6 mice or H2RKO mice. The results of this study demonstrate systemic immunomodulation of responses to intranasally delivered antigen by UVB irradiation and the induction of regulatory cells in the LDLN following UVB exposure. Furthermore, these results implicate a role for the H2R in UVB-induced suppression of antigen-specific responses in the draining lymph nodes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asthma -- Immunotherapy</field><field name="subject">Ultraviolet radiation -- Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Asthma -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Immunosuppression</field><field name="subject">Asthma -- Animal models</field><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">Ultraviolet</field><field name="subject">Immune suppression</field><field name="subject">Regulatory cell</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0086</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An autonomic communication framework for wireless sensor networks</field><field name="creator">Sun, Jingbo</field><field name="description">Sensor networks use a group of collaborating sensor nodes to collect information about real world phenomena. Sensor nodes use low-power short-range radio links to communicate with each other. Communication between sensor nodes shows significant variation over time and space. This can lead to unreliable and unpredictable network performance. These dynamic and lossy characteristics of wireless links pose major challenges for building reliable sensor networks and raise new issues that data delivery protocols must address. This thesis addresses the problems of designing protocols to overcome time-varying environmental conditions that lead to unpredictable network performance. The goal is to provide reliable data delivery in sensor networks and to minimise energy use. The major contributions of this thesis are: measuring the performance of wireless links in field trials on a time scale of weeks; systematic analysis of strengths and weaknesses of existing data delivery protocols; and the design, implementation and testing of a novel autonomic communication framework. We have measured link quality over time in experiments in unattended outdoor environments. Most previous work focused on spatial properties and experiments were not extensive, only lasting for a few hours. Besides common phenomena found in other work, such as the variation of network performance over time and the existence of asymmetric links, we find that links are independent over long time scales, and performance patterns of links are different. We also analyse the performance of data delivery protocols that use different techniques to improve reliability in sensor networks. Through systematic analysis of strengths and weaknesses of existing data delivery strategies, we find that networks using a single technique can only perform well for a limited range of link conditions. Different strategies are required in different operating conditions. Based on these experimental and theoretical studies, a novel autonomic communication framework (ACF) for wireless sensor networks is proposed. Nodes in this ACF are able to change their behaviour to adapt to time-varying environments so that optimal network performance can be achieved. Our framework provides a holistic solution for reliable data delivery to overcome time-varying wireless links. Our implementation and experimental evaluations demonstrate that this holistic framework is effective for reliable and energy-efficient data delivery in realistic sensor network settings.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autonomic computing</field><field name="subject">Computer network protocols</field><field name="subject">Sensor networks</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Wireless LANs</field><field name="subject">Data delivery protocols</field><field name="subject">Wireless sensor network</field><field name="subject">Adaptive</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0087</field></doc><doc><field name="title">N-Heterocyclic carbene-metal complexes derived from imidazolium-linked cyclophane and biimidazolium salts</field><field name="creator">Hesler, Valerie Jane</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an investigation into the synthesis of metal complexes of (Nheterocyclic carbene)-based cyclophanes. There were three main areas of focus: synthesis and complexation of bis(4,5-dihydroimidazolium) salts; the synthesis and complexation of phenol-functionalised imidazolium cyclophanes; and the synthesis and complexation of (N-heterocyclic carbene)-based cyclophanes by C-C bond activation of biimidazolium salts with electron-rich metals. The synthesis of xylyl-linked bis(4,5-dihydroimidazolium) salts was investigated. Attempts to prepare these compounds by the cyclisation of a tetraamine (linear or macrocyclic) were unsuccessful due difficulties in preparing the tetraamines. The target compounds could be prepared by adapting the methods developed for the synthesis of bis(imidazolium) salts however problems associated with purification and stability of the products prevented complexation studies. A series of phenol-, phenoxide- and anisole-functionalised imidazolium cyclophanes were prepared. Their structural properties were investigated using dynamic nmr studies and X-ray crystallography. Complexation of the functionalised cyclophanes was investigated. The phenol cyclophane I formed a dinuclear complex with mercury(II). This complex is the first example of a complex derived from a phenol-functionalised imidazolium cyclophane. However the anisole cyclophane II and the unsymmetrical phenol/ortho cyclophane III were unable to form complexes possibly due to steric hindrance and instability of the cyclophane respectively. Preliminary complexation studies of the bis(imidazolium)phenol V suggested that complexation with palladium(II) and mercury(II) were possible but more work is required to determine the optimum reaction conditions. A series of biimidazolium salts VI (both new and known) were prepared. Previously reported biimidazolium salts have very low solubility in common solvents therefore the incorporation of long alkyl chains to the bridging group was investigated as a means to improve the solubility. The structure of the salts was explored using a range of techniques including dynamic nmr spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, UV/Visible spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry. Some of the biimidazolium salts were able to rotate about the C2-C2' bond and the free energy of activation for this process was estimated using dynamic nmr studies. C-C bond activation of the biimidazolium salts with palladium(0) was used to form a series of palladium(II) complexes (VII) of (NHC)-based cyclophanes. These reactions are the first examples of the synthesis of bis(NHC) complexes by C-C bond activation. The reactivity of the biimidazolium salts with palladium(0) was compared to their solution structure and it was found that only the biimidazolium that were able to rotate about the C2-C2' bond could react with palladium(0).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Carbenes (Methylene compounds)</field><field name="subject">Heterocyclic compounds -- Synthesis</field><field name="subject">Metal complexes</field><field name="subject">N-heterocyclic carbenes</field><field name="subject">Metal complexes</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic approaches towards gold (I) and silver (I) complexes of functionalised N-heterocyclic carbene ligands</field><field name="creator">Hickey, James Laurence</field><field name="description">This work focuses on the design and synthesis of Au(I) and Ag(I) complexes from ligand systems that aim to combine both N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and phosphine ligand types. A number of synthetic approaches towards both the ligands and the prepared metal complexes have been developed, with a concerted effort on achieving the desired Au(I) or Ag(I) complexes with minimal reaction steps and synthetic style. The thesis body is divided into two main sections. The first section addresses the preparation of suitable ligand precursors of potential Au(I) and Ag(I) complexes in the form of halo- and phosphino-functionalised imidazolium salts. Several series of haloalkylimidazolium salts were prepared that encompass a range of halogens (Cl, Br, I), alkyl substituents (Me, i-Pr, t-Bu, n-Bu), differing alkyl linker length (n = 0-3), and a variety of organic spacers employed to bridge multi-imidazolium moieties. Novel bidentate and multidentate phosphinoalkylimidazolium salts were synthesised from the various haloalkylimidazolium salts, via the substitution of a halide with nucleophilic diphenylphosphide. A new approach towards rare methylene bridged phosphinomethylimidazolium salts was achieved from the reactions of halomethylimidazolium salts with diphenylphosphine. The second section investigates the preparation of Au(I) and Ag(I) complexes from the halo- and phosphino-functionalised imidazolium salts. A series of dicationic 10, 12, and 14-membered metallacyclic Ag(I) complexes were prepared from the bidentate phosphinoalkylimidazolium salts. The dinuclear Ag(I) metallacycles combine two phosphino-functionalised NHC ligands that are bridged by two coordinated Ag(I) ions in an exclusively head-to-head arrangement. A dinuclear Ag(I) metallacycle was investigated for transmetallation potential to a Au(I) complex and found to selectively transmetallate at the Ag(I) coordinated to the NHC ligands to form a bimetallic metallacycle. Unexpected phosphine oxidation of a 10-membered dinuclear Ag(I) metallacycle resulted in complex disproportionation to an isolable and rare silver(I) trimer. Metal-NHC complexes from haloalkylimidazolium salts have not been reported previously, a novel approach to the synthesis of a series of Au(I) complexes from haloalkylimidazolium salts and a respective gold source was developed and is reported herein. Different synthetic approaches towards Au(I) complexes with the phosphinoalkylimidazolium salts explored a variety of ways to generate the NHC from an imidazolium in the presence of the phosphine. A one-pot, high yielding synthesis of a dinuclear Au(I) complex from PPh3 was also devised, with controlled assembly of the complex resulting in a similar head-to-head ligand arrangement to the dinuclear Ag(I) metallacycles. As an aside, a family of mononuclear [Au(R2NHC)2]+ complexes (R = Me, i-Pr, t- Bu, n-Bu, Cy) prepared previously in our research group, was expanded because of the promising antimitochondrial activity shown by [Au(i-Pr2NHC)2]+. Two new [Au(R2NHC)2]+ complexes with simple alkyl chain functionality were prepared with fine-tuned lipophilicity in close proximity to that of [Au(i-Pr2NHC)2]+.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anti-infective agents</field><field name="subject">Carbenes (Methylene compounds)</field><field name="subject">Heterocyclic compounds -- Synthesis</field><field name="subject">Ligands</field><field name="subject">Metals -- Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Synthesis of gold (I) and silver (I) complexes</field><field name="subject">Anticancer agents</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0090</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A National Study of Gastrointestinal Parasites Infecting Dogs and Cats in Australia</field><field name="creator">C.Palmer@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Despite the popularity of companion animal ownership in Australia, recent and comprehensive information with regard to the prevalence, epidemiology and public health significance associated with gastrointestinal parasites of pet dogs and cats in Australia is largely lacking.   The primary aims of this study were to close this knowledge gap and to evaluate the veterinarian&#146;s perception, awareness and knowledge of GI parasites in their locality, from a veterinary and public health stand-point.  This included sourcing information with regard to commonly recommended deworming protocols.  The awareness of pet owners regarding parasitic zoonoses and the degree of education provided to them by veterinarians was also determined.

A total of 1400 canine and 1063 feline faecal samples were collected from veterinary clinics and refuges from across Australia. The overall prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in dogs and cats was 23.9% (CI 21.7-26.1) and 18.4% (CI 16.1-20.7), respectively. Overall Giardia duodenalis was the most prevalent parasite in dogs (9.3%, CI 7.8-10.8) followed by hookworm (6.7%, CI 5.4-8.0). Isospora felis was the most prevalent parasite in cats (5.6%, CI 4.2-7.0), followed by Toxocara cati (3.2%, CI 2.1-4.3).  

A highly sensitive and species-specific PCR-RFLP technique was utilized to differentiate the various hookworm species which can infect dogs and cats directly from eggs in faeces. Ancylostoma ceylanicum was detected for the first time in Australia in 10.9% of the dogs found positive for hookworm. This was a significant finding in terms of the zoonotic risk associated with this parasite.

The zoonotic potential of Giardia and Cryptosporidium was investigated by genetically characterising isolates recovered from dogs and cats. All but one of the Giardia isolates successfully genotyped were host specific, indicating a low zoonotic risk. It was hypothesized that the lack of zoonotic Giardia Assemblages was a consequence of there being a low prevalence of Giardia in the human population. The Cryptosporidium recovered from dogs and cats was determined to be Cryptosporidium canis and Cryptosporidium felis respectively, a finding which supports growing evidence that Cryptosporidium in companion animals is of limited public health significance to healthy people. 

Very few of the veterinarians surveyed in the study routinely discussed the zoonotic potential of pet parasites with clients. Most of the veterinarians recommended the regular prophylactic administration of anthelmintics throughout a pet&#146;s life. 

The low national prevalence of GI parasites reported is most likely a consequence of the widespread use of anthelmintics by pet owners. There is an over-reliance on anthelmintics by veterinarians to prevent and control parasites and their zoonotic risk. This has resulted in veterinarians becoming complacent about educating pet owners about parasites. A combination of routinely screening faecal samples for parasites, strategic anthelmintic regimes and improved pet owner education is recommended for the control of GI parasites in pet dogs and cats in Australia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gastrointestinal parasites</field><field name="subject">dogs</field><field name="subject">cats</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090617.152058</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct-Coupling of the Photovoltaic Array and PEM Electrolyser in Solar-Hydrogen Systems for Remote Area Power Supply</field><field name="creator">Paul, Biddyut</field><field name="description">Renewable energy-hydrogen systems for remote area power supply (RAPS) constitute an early niche market for sustainable hydrogen energy. The primary objective of this research has been to investigate the possibility of direct coupling of a PV array to a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser by appropriate matching of the current-voltage characteristics of both the components. The degree to which optimal matching can be achieved by direct coupling has been studied both theoretically and experimentally.       A procedure for matching the maximum power point output of a PV array with the PEM electrolyser load to maximise the energy transfer between them has been presented. The key element of the matching strategy proposed is to vary the series-parallel stacking of individual cells in both the PV array and the PEM electrolyser so that the characteristic current (I) -voltage (V) curves of both the components align as closely as possible. This procedure is applied to a case study of direct coupling a PV array comprising 75 W panels (BP275) to a PEM electrolyser bank assembled from 50 W PEM electrolyser stacks (h-tec StaXX7). It was estimated theoretically that the optimal PV-electrolyser combination would yield an energy transfer of over 94% of the theoretical maximum on annual basis. This combination also gave the lowest hydrogen production cost on a lifecycle basis.       An experimental test of this theoretical result for direct coupling was conducted over a period of 728 hours, with an effective direct-coupling operational time of about 467 hours (omitting the hours of zero solar radiation). Close agreement between the theoretically predicted and actual energy transfer from the PV array to the electrolyser bank in this trial was found. The difference between theoretical and experimental hydrogen production was less then 1.2%. The overall solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency was found to be 7.8%. The electrolysers were characterised before and after the direct coupling experiment, and showed a small decline in Faraday efficiency and energy efficiency. But this decline was less than the uncertainties in the measured values, so that no firm conclusions about electrolyser degradation can be drawn at this stage.       Another direct-coupling experiment, using a larger scale PV-electrolyser system, that is, a 2.4 kW PV array at RMIT connected to the 'Oreion Alpha 1' stand-alone 2 kW PEM electrolyser developed by the CSIRO Energy Technology, was also successfully conducted for a period of 1519 hours (with 941 hours of effective operational time of the electrolyser).       Energy-efficient direct coupling of a PV array and electrolyser as examined in this thesis promises to improve the economic viability of solar-hydrogen systems for remote power supply since the costs of an electronic coupling system employing a maximum power point tracker (MPPT) and dc-to-dc converter (around US$ 700/ kW) are avoided.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Direct coupling</field><field name="subject">PV array</field><field name="subject">PEM electrolyser</field><field name="subject">MPPT</field><field name="subject">solar-hydrogen RAPS</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090624.141048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">There's no meaning in chocolate: a narrative study of women's journeys beyond the disruption of depression</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Jan D</field><field name="description">Professional treatment, mainly medical and psychological, dominates research and clinical practice concerning women and their recovery from depression. This thesis challenges the assumption that women cannot be 'experts' actively involved in their own recovery. This study explored the narratives of eighteen women in Aotearoa New Zealand whose lives had been seriously disrupted by depression. They had found ways other than, or in addition to, professional solutions that helped them to live undisrupted meaningful lives. 	The research used a narrative inquiry approach informed by authors from across the social sciences including Arthur Frank, Jerome Bruner and Rivka Tuval-Mashiach. The underpinning social constructionist understanding of depression is informed by the work of Jane Ussher and Janet Stoppard. The women whose individual narratives provide the core data for the study ranged in age from 32 to 70 years at the time they told their stories. Their lives had been disrupted by depression at different times during the last 50 years of the twentieth century. Five of the women met as a group with the researcher as the analysis began, and their ideas informed significant aspects of the conclusions.	The women had all experienced major depressive disorder, although this was not always formally diagnosed. Their recovery had involved a range of responses from outside the professional mainstream including physical, mental, social and spiritual aspects. Each woman had sought and found a 'formula' that was 'right' for her. The narratives showed all the women talked of their experience with depression and recovery in an holistic and contextualised way. They all talked about 'chocolate' solutions which provided symptom relief, and 'deeper' and often more complex sets of solutions which enabled them to discover or re-discover meaningful ways to live. Meaning-making often involved growing spiritual or transpersonal awareness in the broadest sense. A surprising finding was that the patterns of recovery were not related to the severity of the depression at the worst time. Rather, it emerged that the ways the women talked about their recovery journeys mirrored their stories of the 'jolly good reasons' why they were depressed; the more complex and lengthy the story leading up to the worst times, the more complex the formulae required for recovery. 	The implications of the research for clinical practice and for policy makers are that depression and recovery need to be seen as gendered, contextualised, and holistic. Women need opportunities to discover and take advantage of a range of 'things' so that they can find their own 'right formula' for recovery. This formula may involve professional treatment including anti-depressant medication and psychological therapy, but it is likely to involve many other things as well. This study challenges the notion that recovery needs to be guided by a professional expert, and creates hope for women being able to learn from each other's experiences.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narrative inquiry</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="subject">Depression</field><field name="subject">Women's recovery</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="subject">Lay solutions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The efficacy and microstructure effects of insider trading regulations</field><field name="creator">Gilbert, Aaron</field><field name="description">The competition for external capital amongst small and developing financial markets has resulted in a growing awareness of the importance of investor protection laws if markets are to be competitive. One particularly important aspect of such laws is the need to control the behaviour of insiders. Insider trading, widely perceived as trading by investors who have an unfair advantage by virtue of access to confidential information, represents a significant threat to market confidence and investors' willingness to invest in the market. For small markets therefore, not controlling such behaviour represents a significant cost in terms of the development of the market and the economy as a whole. However, while insider trading can do significant harm to the market, it also has the potential to be beneficial to the market as a signal of incorrectly priced information. The question becomes therefore how best to balance the advantages and disadvantages of insider trading. Most markets have relied on regulations to control insiders, however, little research has been done to establish if this is effective.This thesis seeks to provide additional evidence with respect to the role of regulation in controlling insider trading. The issue is explored within the context of the New Zealand market where recent legislation, the Securities Market Amendment Act 2002, offers a prime opportunity to seek further understanding on the issue. In particular, four studies focussed on the role of regulation with respect to insider trading are undertaken within this thesis. In the first the impact of the law change on the profitability and informational base of insiders is examined. A significant decline in profitability is observed in addition to evidence of a change in the informational basis of insiders' trades from knowledge of upcoming announcements to short-term market mispricing. The impact of the new law on four aspects of the market is then examined. A significant increase in liquidity is found following the introduction of the new law, as well as significant reductions in the cost of equity, bid-ask spread and return volatility. The law therefore appears to have improved these aspects of the market. The bid-ask spreads were then examined in more depth by observing the impact of the laws on the cost of informed trading. Strong evidence of a decline in the cost of informed trading was observed, along with significant decreases in the proportion of the spread composed of information asymmetry costs. The declines were largest for those firms most prone to insider trading.Lastly, the elements of an effective insider trading regime were investigated by examining the impact of various legal variables on the cost of informed trading and the total spread. The results indicated that stronger laws have resulted in lower spreads and less informed trading costs, and that effective regimes should prevent insiders passing on their information, should rely on financial penalties over criminal sanctions, and should be both enforceable and policed by a strong public regulator. Overall this thesis finds strong evidence that insider trading laws can be effective in controlling the behaviour of insiders, and that well drafted statutory regulations can be of significant benefit to the market.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Securities Market Amendment Act 2002</field><field name="subject">Insider traders</field><field name="subject">Securities</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Balancing recognition and disrespect: recovery as the process of identity formation: a New Zealand study of how services shape recovery from sexual abuse</field><field name="creator">Frerichs, Gudrun</field><field name="description">This study explored how the recovery of victims of sexual abuse is shaped by services available. Using the philosophical underpinnings of critical theory within the framework of Honneth's recognition theory this study provides an understanding of participants' experiences and views of recovery from sexual abuse. The study was conducted with ten adult survivors of sexual abuse using semi-structured individual interviews and two focus groups with eight service providers. The analysis identified that the recovery from sexual abuse is the development of a positive sense of identity reflected by participants' self-confidence, self-respect, and self-esteem. In this study this is described as the process of identity formation. Services shaped recovery from sexual abuse by providing experiences of recognition and disrespect. Recognition was given in the form of emotional support and care, cognitive respect, and social esteem that led to an improvement of participants' functioning. Disrespect was perceived by participants as they struggled with the invisibility of sexual abuse, with inequality, and with the lack of understanding, through which their overall functioning deteriorated. Recovery emerged as a dynamic process that, most of all, required from services that they provide experiences of recognition and from survivors that they accurately perceive that recognition was given to them. For recovery to occur, participants needed to balance experiences of recognition and disrespect, a process in which they needed to surrender the longing for the entirely good and benign caregiver and accept that both 'good' and 'bad' qualities reside in each caregiver, agency, therapist, or generally the 'other'.  This balancing resulted in the development of self-confidence, self-respect, and self-esteem. Recovery was experienced by participants when they were able to resist disrespect and either engaged in fighting for their rights or removing themselves from situations in which their rights could be violated. Only by having a practical experience of being able to protect their physical and psychological integrity did participants become aware that they had recovered from the legacies of sexual abuse and could proceed with their lives without professional assistance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Critical theory</field><field name="subject">Service provision, Treatment, Psychotherapy, Mental health</field><field name="subject">Recognition theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using information and communication technology to facilitate supply chain management in the New Zealand construction industry</field><field name="creator">Wang, Ye</field><field name="description">The New Zealand construction supply chain today is inefficient. From a literature review it is found that non value adding activities including waste of time and materials are caused by islands of information with ineffective communication between supply chain participants. This represents an opportunity for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to provide a strategic supply chain management model for the industry enabling interaction and shared information between all parties. To evaluate the performance of ICTs in the New Zealand construction supply chain, this thesis uses as a case study newly launched software---BlueSky. BlueSky was developed by the Building Integration Software Company located in AUT Technical Park. BlueSky was designed to integrate the fragments of the current information flow of the chain from architect through to the end property owner.   Supporting Data was gathered by distributing a structured questionnaire designed to find the opportunities and inhibitors for utilizing ICTs to facilitate the synthesis of the chain. 200 responses were received. The study was funded by a TEC grant. The BlueSky case study is based on two pilot sites; one is an architectural design company and the other is a master contractor company in Auckland. The case study also evaluated the potential problems which may bring risks to supply chain members and provide possible recommendations for future research.  The study found from the results of the questionnaire that a significant shift in the mindset of participants of the supply chain will be necessary in terms of collaboration and team work if mutual benefits are to be achieved.  It is found that in the two pilot sites BlueSky did make a significant difference in terms of reduced cost, accuracy of information, improved documentation management, and overall increased speed and clarity of information.  In the wider community of the industry as a whole considerable education is needed to break down mistrust between members. In general each member appears to be determined to secure the best result as individuals rather than considering the overall outcome for the whole chain. This reluctance to co-operate is coupled with a reluctance to utilize ICTs. Recommendations are made to overcome this mindset.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Supply chain</field><field name="subject">Business strategy</field><field name="subject">Business communication</field><field name="subject">Information and communication technologies</field><field name="subject">Construction industry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/74</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The leadership experience of first line nurse managers working in the Cook Islands: a qualitative descriptive study</field><field name="creator">Iro, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">A qualitative descriptive approach was undertaken to explore the leadership experience of seven first line nurse managers working in the Cook Islands.  For the purposes of this study first line nurse managers are those nurses working as a charge nurse in a hospital, nursing supervisors, chief public health nurse, and nurses working autonomously in the outer islands of the Cook Islands.  Nurses in these roles are in key positions to influence the practice of others and set the standard of practice and culture of a unit.  The participants were recruited if they were currently employed in any of these positions.  The seven participants were all Cook Islands women who received their undergraduate nursing education in the Cook Islands. The purpose of the study was to describe their leadership experience, to raise an awareness of their role, and to make recommendations to support and improve the preparation of nurses for leadership roles in the Cook Islands.  Through face-to-face interviews, the participants' stories were audio taped and transcribed verbatim.  Six of the seven transcripts required translation from Cook Islands Maori to English and this was conducted by the researcher who is fluent in both languages.  Content and thematic analysis of the data revealed a spiritual, emotive and intuitive theme in the participants' leadership experience.  The findings of the study revealed the self confidence of these nurses to manage in this role despite being challenged by management issues and the lack of preparedness for the role.  The supportive network established within their staff, their family and the people around them has provided the impetus to continue to 'serve' their people.  The findings also revealed that these nurses recognised the need to continue to learn and develop themselves and their staff.   The findings of this study have significance for nurses aspiring to be nurse leaders in the Cook Islands or other Pacific Islands and rural communities.  A key stakeholder in this study is the Cook Islands Ministry of Health, as insights and awareness gained can contribute to an appropriate preparation and support programme for nurses working in its organisation.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative descriptive study</field><field name="subject">Leadership theories</field><field name="subject">Self-awareness</field><field name="subject">Professional relationships</field><field name="subject">Life long learning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/79</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attitudinal shifting: a grounded theory of health promotion in coronary care</field><field name="creator">Watson, Sheona</field><field name="description">Current New Zealand health policy encourages collaborative health promotion in all sectors of health service delivery. The integrated approach to the acute management of coronary heart disease in a coronary care unit, combining medical therapy and lifestyle change, supports clinical health promotion. The aim of this study was to use the grounded theory approach to discover the main concerns of nurses' promoting health in an acute coronary care setting and to explain the processes that nurses used to integrate health promotional activities into their practice. Seventeen registered nurses from three coronary care units within a large metropolitan city in New Zealand were interviewed. Data were constantly compared and analysed using Glaser's emergent approach to grounded theory.The main concern for nurses promoting health within coronary care was ritualistic practice. In this study, ritualistic practice concerns the medically-based protocols, routines, language and technology that drives nursing practice in coronary care. This concern was resolved via the socio-cultural process of attitudinal shifting that occurs over time involving three stages. The three conceptual categories, environmental pressures, practice reality and responsive action are the main components of the theory of attitudinal shifting. In environmental pressures nurses experience a tension between specialist medically-dominated nursing practice and the generalist nursing role of promoting health. In practice reality, nurses become aware that the individual needs of patients are not being met. This causes role conflict until the nurse observes colleagues who role model possibilities for practice, working with patients to promote health. Responsive action sees the nurse engaging in self-development, also focusing on the nurse-patient relationship, thereby enabling active patient involvement in individual health-promoting decisions.The findings from this research have implications for nursing practice and education. With the increasing specialisation in nursing practice, these findings may be of interest to nurses working in delegated medical roles where the reality of everyday practice precludes nurses from undertaking their essential nursing role. Health care facilities also need to ensure that there are opportunities for the personal and professional development of nursing staff. The place of health promotion within nursing undergraduate curricula needs to be examined, as many nurses found that they were ill prepared for undertaking health promotional activities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="subject">Glaser</field><field name="subject">Coronary care nursing</field><field name="subject">Health promotion</field><field name="subject">Health policy - New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Professional development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/81</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of breathing pattern retraining on performance in competitive cyclists</field><field name="creator">Vickery, Rachel L</field><field name="description">The increased work of breathing associated with intense cycling has been identified as a factor that may negatively affect cycling performance.  The aerodynamic position, abnormal respiratory mechanics either at rest or during exercise, and the development of a tachypnoeic breathing pattern are factors known to increase the work of breathing.  Breathing pattern retraining aims to decrease the work of breathing by delaying the onset of dynamic hyperinflation and the recruitment of accessory breathing muscles.  To date no studies have investigated the performance, physiological and perceptual consequences of manipulating breathing pattern in trained cyclists.  Purpose:  The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of breathing pattern retraining on 20-km time trial performance and respiratory and metabolic measures in competitive cyclists.  Method: Twenty-four competitive male cyclists (age 37.7 &#177; 8.6 years, mean &#177; SD; peak 4.34 &#177; 0.47 L&#183;min-1) were match paired on 20-km time trial performance and assigned at random to either an intervention group (breathing pattern retraining; N = 12) or control group (N = 12).  20-km time trial performance, pulmonary function and the physiological and perceptual response during a maximal incremental cycle step test were assessed pre- and post-intervention.  The intervention group underwent four weeks of specific breathing pattern retraining using exercises designed to reduce dynamic hyperinflation and optimise respiratory mechanics.  The control group attended the laboratory once a week during this period and performed a 10 minute sub-maximal ride wearing a biofeedback breathing harness.  The control group was led to believe the purpose for their participation was to investigate the effect that maximal exercise had on breathing pattern, and to test the reliability of the breathing harness.  There was no attempt to modify the breathing pattern of the control group.  Data were analysed using an MS Excel spreadsheet designed for statistical analysis.  The uncertainty in the effect was expressed as 90% confidence limits and a smallest worthwhile effect of 1.0% was assumed.  Results:  The intervention group showed substantial improvements in 20-km time trial performance (-1.5 &#177; 1.1%) and incremental power (3.2 &#177; 3%).  Additionally, breathing frequency (-13.2 &#177; 8.9%; -9.5 &#177; 8.4%), tidal volume (10.6 &#177; 8.5%; 9.4 &#177; 7.6%), inspiratory time (10.1 &#177; 8%; 9.4 &#177; 7.7%), breathing RPE (-30 &#177; 33.9%; -24.7 &#177; 28.1%) and leg RPE (-27.9 &#177; 38.5%; -24.7 &#177; 28.2%) were all positively affected at lactate threshold and lactate turn point.  No positive changes were observed in the control group for 20-km time trial performance (0.0 &#177; 1.0%), incremental power (-1.4 &#177; 3.5%), breathing frequency (-1.6 &#177; 8.0%; -2.0 &#177; 7.9%), tidal volume (0.9 &#177; 7.2%; 2.9 &#177; 9.4%), breathing RPE (16.1 &#177; 50.2%, 24.8 &#177; 43%) or leg RPE (13.4 &#177; 39.6%; 19.9 &#177; 43.2%) .  Conclusion: These results provide evidence of the performance enhancing effect of four weeks of breathing pattern retraining in cyclists.  Furthermore, they suggest breathing pattern can be retrained to exhibit a controlled pattern, without a tachypnoeic shift, during high intensity cycling.  Additionally, these results indicate breathing pattern retraining attenuates the respiratory and peripheral perceived effort during incremental exercise.

At the time of being interviewed, they were aged from 9-14 years and participating in regular school classes. For the purposes of the study, being a student was identified as a key occupational role and failing to achieve tasks associated with this role was viewed as failure to achieve role competency. The issue of learning difficulties has been extensively researched but rarely from the perspective of young people. A primary goal of the study was to obtain young people's perceptions of the experience of learning difficulties. This is consistent with international moves to obtain the views of young people through research. Narrative interviewing procedures were used and participants were invited to talk about the things they enjoyed doing and felt they are good at doing, as well as the things they had trouble doing. They proved to be capable informants and provided a rich range of narrative data. Interviews were audio taped, transcribed and interview transcripts were synthesised into a story format. Each participant had the opportunity to check their story and give their final consent to its use as data in this thesis. As part of the analytical process, core narratives were constructed to capture the essence of each participant's story, their unique narrative voice, relationship with others and fundamental message. These narratives are presented in full, introducing participants as characters in their own story and revealing the nature of the stories told. In addition, thematic narratives drawn from the stories have been collated into three key categories, which relate to self and learning efforts, relationship with the social world and being occupational. The narrative analysis found that learning difficulties occurred as a negative interruption in the progressive course of participants' story, with the potential to compromise their sense of identity and well-being. However, the study also found that when participants chose to characterise themselves in relation to occupations or roles in which they felt most successful, they were able to express a more positive and holistic identity than that of being "learning disabled". Furthermore, in the context of an occupational narrative that included their talents and abilities, learning difficulties were not necessarily the determining factor in how life was for them or where their lives might go. The implication of the study's findings relate to the importance for young people of not only experiencing competency in significant occupations and roles, but also being seen to be competent. This underpins a positive sense of identity and well-being, which is likely to link to their future. They need to understand for themselves and for those around them to understand, that it is possible to be intelligent yet have trouble with basic numeracy and literacy skills. Empathetic adults have a vital role to play in providing the information, opportunities and supportive context in which young people develop an understanding of their occupational competencies and become competent human beings. There is a place for further narrative research with young New Zealanders; there are many stories from other perspectives yet to be told. Ongoing research conducted through an occupational lens is needed to understand the way in which young people with learning difficulties develop, or fail to develop, an understanding of themselves as competent occupational beings and how this supports or constrains their transition through adolescence into adulthood.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children's experiences of learning difficulties</field><field name="subject">Specific learning difficulties</field><field name="subject">Occupational identity</field><field name="subject">Narrative research</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Last man hanging</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Robyn Joan</field><field name="description">This project involves the retelling of a historic New Zealand story using a system of multiple narrations.

Its narrative discourse involves the orchestration of relationships through a compendium of characters, architecture, artifacts, environments and typography. The book integrates narrative voices that may be grouped into two often-conflicting positions; the story as it appeared in newspapers at the time, and the writer's personal consideration of an alternative series of events and emphases. Though an argument of tellings the book suggests a different verdict to that established by the courts in 1956.Finally, the exegesis contextualises both works.

The study grew out of my reflections on my own challenging, yet rewarding, journey as an international student in New Zealand, and aimed to investigate and unfold the reality of foreigners living and working experience under the influence of traditional Chinese culture, specifically in Pan Yu district, Guang Zhou City, Guang Dong Province. I was interested to find the cultural differences that the teachers struggled to accept or understand. I wondered whether the foreign teachers would reshape their personal beliefs and values, especially about teaching, because of the cultural differences they encountered in China. A sample of eight foreign teachers, from Australia, America, Canada and New Zealand, took part in semi-structured interviews in which I hoped to capture critical incidents in their inter-cultural experience. I was also able to undertake two observations of classroom practice. The data collected was then analysed using Boyatzis' (1998) system of thematic analysis. The research found that participants had similar experiences during their residence in China. For instance, the majority of participants showed a long period of cultural adoption and they all defined their experience as challenging. All participants refused to reshape their moral beliefs about teaching in response to traditional Chinese culture, but that they all, to some extent, eventually adjusted to a Chinese way of thinking. However, issues that direct connected to their own cultural heritage remained unchanged. An interpretation of the findings was that perhaps, on one hand, while the environment and cultural difference initiated various forms of difficulties, on the other hand, participants are trying to reset their personal limits. Most likely, their desire to introduce their Chinese students to a different style of learning convinced them to hold on to personal beliefs about effective teaching and learning, hoping to pass this on to a new generation of Chinese. My research, however, focused on only very small proportion of foreign teachers in China. Further research should be pursued with an expanded focus, to find the potential of the implementation of cultural awareness programmes and support groups for foreigner.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese education system</field><field name="subject">Foreign teachers of English</field><field name="subject">Cultural differences</field><field name="subject">Intercultural experiences</field><field name="subject">Hofstede</field><field name="subject">Pan Yu District</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resurgence</field><field name="creator">Walker, Susan</field><field name="description">The purpose and underlying motivation for this project was to examine the procedure of garment construction methods, by specifically choosing to abandon traditional rules and standards that are associated with mass production.  I chose to explore domestic hand-craft made by women in New Zealand in their domestic situation, focusing on hand-stitched techniques from the past reflecting a nostalgic value which potentially contributed to the garment&#8217;s construction process.  The project sought to utilize the re-using of materials by incorporating previously made hand-craft; and looked at the remaking of second-hand garments by means of deconstruction  and reconstruction. Traditional hand-craft, in this context, refers to the use of craft forms not governed by principles of efficiency, mass production or technology, allowing the garments to contain unique &#8216;one of a kind&#8217; hand-made qualities.  My studio practice specifically focused on exploring the relationship between hand-craft and garment construction, by researching their application and integration into the garment&#8217;s structure, along with disrupting the orderly traditional production process. I was not focusing on the finished garment&#8217;s design. The project provided an opportunity to refocus my attention on the hand-made, as I perceived that the skills required to produce these were being extinguished by modern lifestyles.  Exploration promoted new discoveries by exposing the construction process and revealing unpredicted combinations.  The project explored these ideas, resulting in a range of women&#8217;s garments that revealed, as part of their construction, hand-work which offered a modern variation of nostalgia.  This project comprised of 80% practical work and will be accompanied by an exegesis with a value of 20%.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Garment construction</field><field name="subject">Hand-craft</field><field name="subject">Woman's fashion</field><field name="subject">Traditional clothing construction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing positive physical activity experiences, perceptions and habits: a soccer based intervention in children</field><field name="creator">Tegg, Rebecca</field><field name="description">Levels of participation in physical activity and sport by the New Zealand population are in decline, whilst the levels of sedentary behaviours are rising. Developing positive physical activity experiences, perceptions and habits in childhood may provide an effective approach to decrease the burden of inactivity. The purpose of this thesis was to improve knowledge of the efficacy of a sport-based intervention to increase physical activity levels of New Zealand children from a low socio-economic background. This was achieved by implementing an after-school soccer intervention at two low decile schools in Auckland, New Zealand. To determine current levels of physical activity, fifty-eight children wore a NL-2000 pedometer for four consecutive days (three weekdays and one weekend). Mean step counts (&#177; SD) for boys were 17018 (&#177; 4640) and for girls 12415 (&#177; 4329) on weekdays, and for boys 12507 (&#177; 4338) and girls 9537 (&#177; 4421) on weekends. Nearly 50% of girls and 37% of boys were not reaching previously published daily step count recommendations of 15,000 for boys and 12,000 for girls during weekdays. The feasibility and efficacy of a six-week after-school soccer programme (2/hr.wk-1) on physical activity levels of 70 children (43 boys, 27 girls) compared to a control group of 25 children (23 boys, 2 girls) was determined in a randomised controlled trial. Measures of physical activity (4 day sealed pedometry), mass and height were completed at baseline, Week 6 (end of the intervention), and at three-month post-intervention. Compared to control, participants in the soccer programme attained higher weekday step counts after 6 weeks (treatment 16980 &#177; 4515; control 15021 &#177; 3783) and these were sustained three months post-intervention (treatment 16218 &#177; 4591; control 14591 &#177; 3488). However, these step count differences were not statistically significant. When children were grouped into activity tertiles (low, moderate and highly active) the intervention effect was more evident in the low to moderately active children. Further analysis revealed that the treatment groups&#8217; moderate activity tertile was significantly more active than the control at follow up (p = 0.0399). This programme may offer a viable alternative to traditional physical activity interventions which concentrate on other forms of physical activity accumulation such as active transport and physical education. However, additional research needs to be carried out to determine whether the absence of statistical differences is simply a lack of statistical power.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">Sport</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Intervention</field><field name="subject">After-school</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of the experience of children and prospective parents as they transition into a permanent placement arrangement: an interpretive collective case study</field><field name="creator">Shinkfield, Carol</field><field name="description">This research study examines the psychological and emotional experiences of children and parents as they embark on a permanent placement living arrangement. A permanent placement living arrangement is entered into when a child is no longer able to reside with their family of origin. Three family groups participated in the study and separate interviews were conducted with both the children and placement parents. Overall, three interviews were conducted, with the first interview taking place prior to the child&#8217;s transition into the family. A further two interviews were conducted with the participants after the transition had taken place. The findings of this study indicate that both the parents and children were profoundly affected by the experience of permanent placement. The common themes that emerged from the data were the hopes, anxieties and coping strategies of the participants which became the focal point of analysis. The parents experienced a mixture of fulfilment, tempered with anxieties of whether they would be able to provide adequate care for the child placed with them. Whereas, the children appeared to find it difficult to trust that this experience would be any different from their previous experiences. The study concludes that further attention is needed in the preparation for the transition into permanent placement. It further concludes that &#8216;after transition&#8217; support is important to the stability of the placement.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Permanent placement</field><field name="subject">Foster care</field><field name="subject">Adoption</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Parents</field><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electronic commerce and internationalisation in New Zealand SMEs</field><field name="creator">Jia, Jia</field><field name="description">This research focuses on internationalisation and e-commerce in small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a significant part of the New Zealand economy.

Both phenomena are examined separately to explore relevant issues, followed by consideration of the interrelationship between the two phenomena. Ten case studies of New Zealand SMEs engaged in international business were conducted. Qualitative data was collected in semi-structured interviews with key members of each SME. The interview data were supplemented with secondary data sources, including publicly available information on the firms and their activities. A within-case and cross-case analysis was performed based around the three research foci identified above. The research findings reveal that while there is a high level of confidence among the SMEs studied for internationalisation, e-commerce adoption in these firms was at a medium level of maturity. Facilitators and inhibitors of both internationalisation and e-commerce adoption are presented. A major contribution of the study is the consideration of the mutual effects between the two phenomena, in order to raise awareness of internationalisation and e-commerce in SMEs and their significance for SMEs&#8217; competitiveness.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="subject">Small to medium-sized enterprises</field><field name="subject">Internationalisation</field><field name="subject">E-commerce adoption</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/464</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How New Zealand universities present themselves to the public: an analysis of communication strategies</field><field name="creator">Roggendorf, Nadine</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates how the eight state-funded New Zealand universities present themselves in the prospectuses they publish yearly. The background for this research is the fact that the universities now have to compete for students and funding monies because the government has linked the amount of funding to the number of students and the universities&#8217; success in research (McKenzie, 1996). Additionally, student fees and private sources increasingly contribute to the universities&#8217; budget. The entry of competition into the tertiary education sector is a result of recent policy changes that led the education sector from an egalitarian scholarly system with a tradition of open and free access for all citizens to a market-oriented education industry, which contributes considerably to the national economy. This restructuring of the tertiary education sector is part of the major social, political and economic changes that New Zealand went through &#8211; and is still going through &#8211; beginning with the Fourth Labour Government's second term of office from 1987 to 1990 (Holland &amp; Boston, 1990). The historical background of this thesis focuses on these policy changes that influenced all areas of the public life in New Zealand in the last 25 years. The literature review established that these reforms resulted in processes of commodification of education, competitive marketisation and corporatisation of the universities (Butterworth &amp; Tarling, 1994). The purpose of this thesis is to find evidence of these three tendencies within the language and visual presentation of the university prospectuses. The prospectuses have been chosen as the data corpus because they provide a comprehensive overview of the institutions. Moreover, they represent a hybrid genre of an advertorial text type, being partly informational, partly promotional. The data has been analysed by applying textually-oriented discourse analysis (Fairclough, 1992). Discourse analysis has been proven to be a suitable methodology as it links linguistic analysis to the broader social context. The premise of this approach was that social changes leave traces within the discourse. The data analysis confirmed the intended outcome that the tendencies of commodification, marketisation and corporatisation are visible in the present material. This concludes that the order of discourse of business has colonised the order of discourse of tertiary education.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textually-oriented discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Commodification of education</field><field name="subject">New Zealand universities</field><field name="subject">University prospectuses</field><field name="subject">Corporatisation</field><field name="subject">Marketisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Career expectations and requirements of undergraduate hospitality students and the hospitality industry: an analysis of differences</field><field name="creator">Kim, Jung Hee (Ginny)</field><field name="description">The hospitality industry has seen rapid growth through the last three decades. The hospitality industry in New Zealand is still growing steadily. According to the Ministry of Tourism (2008, para. 3), &#8220;Visitor expenditure is forecast (from 2008 to 2014) to increase from $13.73 billion to $19.05 billion per annum, an increase of 41.4%&#8221; (Ministry of tourism, 2008b). Therefore, in response to the needs of the industry, training providers have established a number of hospitality, leisure, travel and tourism degrees (O'Mahony &amp; Sillitoe, 2001). However, previous studies have identified that hospitality management degrees tend to lack importance in the actual world (Harkison, 2004a, 2004b; Steele; 2003). Hospitality management students seem to rate the value of their degrees higher than do employees in the industry (Collins, 2002; Raybould &amp; Wilkins, 2005). Therefore, there are gaps between the expectations and assumptions of students and those of hospitality professionals, which have led to problems in the hospitality industry.  This study has taken three steps to identify: 1) how career expectations, assumptions and requirements differ between undergraduate hospitality management students and management employees in the hospitality industry; 2) The working histories of managerial employees and their perceptions of the industry&#8217;s needs; 3) Establish the perceived value of hospitality management degrees amongst hospitality management undergraduate students and the hospitality industry. To do so, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken, and questionnaires were collected from 137 undergraduates enrolled in a Bachelor of International Hospitality Management degree at AUT University and 74 managerial employees in the hotel industry. After an analysis of the data, the researcher examined and compared the results of both groups&#8217; data with relation to the findings of the literature review.  The following key points emerged from the research: most students expected that they would work in the hospitality industry after completing their course and supposed that their first work field would be in a Food and Beverage department at a management trainee level. The results of the survey show a match between students&#8217; long-term career expectations and the working history of employees. Students also seem to understand the environment of the hospitality industry well. These results show that students organise well, planning for their future careers, and these results were similar with those of some previous studies (Brien, 2004; Harkison, 2004b; Jenkins, 2001). The results of this study identified similarities and differences of perceptions between undergraduate students and managerial employees in the hotel industry. Similarities of students&#8217; perceptions and managerial employees&#8217; perceptions are; &#8226;	Commitment is rated as the most important factor in determining success, while personality is rated the most important attribute for an employee in the hospitality industry. &#8226;	A degree in hospitality management is not recognised as an important qualification by students or employee respondents. Working experience is more important than a bachelor degree of hospitality management for a prospective employee. &#8226;	Students and managerial employees believe that the hospitality educators know the industry well, although educators and employees have different understandings of career expectations. &#8226;	Both parties believe that internship might help hospitality students&#8217; careers in the industry. Differences of perceptions between undergraduate students and managerial employees are; &#8226;	Students believe that knowledge of the industry and experience are the most significant factors for a new employee in the hospitality industry but employees indicate personality. &#8226;	Employees believe that using initiative skills are the most important factor for an employee&#8217;s career development, whereas students answer communication skills. &#8226;	Students believe that a hospitality management bachelor degree will contribute more to the hotel business but employees believe that having three years&#8217; experience will contribute more. &#8226;	Students consider that an employee with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in hospitality will receive higher starting salaries than someone without, but employees disagree. &#8226;	Students suggest that a bachelor of hospitality management degree will affect opportunities for promotion, but employees do not share that opinion. This study found that even if students and managerial employees share some common opinions, many gaps still exist between them. Therefore, the researcher suggests recommendations relating to students&#8217; expectations and assumptions of their job entry level, the working environment in the hospitality industry, the needs of the hospitality industry, and the value of a bachelors degree of hospitality management. Furthermore, the researcher identifies some limitations of this study and areas for further research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Career expectations of hospitality students</field><field name="subject">Career requirements of hospitality managers</field><field name="subject">Hospitality management students</field><field name="subject">Hospitality industry</field><field name="subject">Profile of hospitality managers</field><field name="subject">Questionnaire survey method</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/477</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological effects of drought on perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.)</field><field name="creator">Butler, Tony</field><field name="description">The Canterbury plains are frequently exposed to summer drought and climate predictions forecast that the severity and frequency of summer drought will increase.  The most commonly used pasture grass, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), is drought sensitive.  One possible method to maintain sward dry matter (DM) production under water stress is to use an alternative grass species such as tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.).  The objective of this research was to compare summer DM production of monoculture swards of perennial ryegrass and tall fescue under various seasonal drought regimes to study physiological and biochemical drought responses of each species.  Data were collected over a period of two-summer seasons, Season One (2006-2007) and Season Two (2007-2008) in an automated rain shelter at Lincoln, Canterbury.  Drought treatments included exposure of plants to a spring or autumn drought or a four-weekly "irrigated" drought regime.  DM yields of the two species were similar under each watering regime.  The control treatment, under non-limiting conditions, has the highest accumulated yield in both Season One and Two for ryegrass (17.1 and 15.7 t DM ha&#8315;&#185;) and tall fescue (18.8 and 16.0 t DM &#8315;&#185;) respectively.  Spring and autumn drought treatments were similar for the two species in accumulated yield in either season, however the exposure to drought stress returned yields lower than the control.  Consistently, the lowest-yielding treatment was the four-weekly irrigated drought, which resulted in an average yield across species in Season One of 10.1 t DM ha&#8315;&#185; and 8.35 t DM ha&#8315;&#185; in Season Two.  Growth rates of the swards were calculated using accumulated DM production against accumulated thermal time using a base temperature of 3&#176;C for both species.  The control treatments showed a strong linear relationship for both species in both seasons, though Season Two showed a period of approximately 390 &#176;Cd of no growth.  Spring growth was similar for all treatments until October when both the spring drought and four-weekly irrigated treatment deviated from the control as water stress commenced.  Growth also ceased under autumn drought later in the season.  The physiological drought responses between species and among treatments differed.  Tall fescue under control conditions had the highest photosynthesis rates of 20.5 &#181;mol CO&#8322; m&#8315;&#178; s&#8315;&#185;,or 22% higher than ryegrass, whereas the four-weekly irrigated treatment showed no inter-species differences.  Differences were also found for other gas exchange parameters.  Physiological water use efficiency (phys WUE) in ryegrass was 15% greater than tall fescue in Season Two.  Photosynthesis and gas exchange rates against leaf water potential showed declining gas flow in both species across all treatments in response to drying soil conditions and across all irrigation treatments.  The osmo-protectant proline was 22% higher in concentration in ryegrass than in tall fescue in Season Two and increased in drought stressed treatments in both seasons.  Water stress was found to reduce total chlorophyll concentrations in all treatments and in tall fescue, while little change occurred in the chlorophyll a:b ratio.  In conclusion, the findings from this thesis suggest similar DM responses for the two species under drought.  The findings suggests that tall fescue performs more as a "water user" under drought conditions, compared with perennial ryegrass, which is more a "water saver."

These molecules have two oxygen-ringed portals of a diameter slightly smaller than their internal cavity diameter. This thesis describes syntheses, crystallisations, crystal structure determinations, crystal packing analyses and force field calculations exploring the supramolecular chemistry of Qn molecules and their derivatives. Qn acts as a host for guest molecules and at the outset of this project no metal containing molecule had been encapsulated in a Qn molecule. One aim of this project was to prepare such complexes. This was achieved with the synthesis and characterisation of crystalline {[cis-SnCl4(H2O)2]@Q7}2(SnCl6)3(H3O)6(H2O)23. Other compounds prepared and characterised crystallographically in the course of this project are: [(Q6)(Na3(H2O)8)]2[CoCl4]4[Co(H2O)6]2[CoCl(H2O)5]2(Cl)4, (Q5@Q10)(CH3COOH)(Cl)2(H3O)2(H2O)26, (Cl@Q5)4Q6(SnCl6)8(H3O)20(H2O)24, (Q8)3(PtCl6)4(H3O)8(H2O)x, (Q8)2(PtCl6)3(H3O)6(H2O)18, (Q7)(Cr3O10)(H3O)2(H2O)x and (Q6)(SnCl6)(H3O)2(H2O)x. While the smaller Qn (n = 5?) retain their circular forms, the larger Qn (n &amp;gt 8) are less rigid and distort to accommodate larger guests. After analysis of the crystal structures of these Qn compounds and those listed in the Cambridge Structural Database, the principal packing motifs of the Qn molecules were elucidated. The most common is the portal-to-side interaction in which the portal oxygen atoms of one Qn approach the hydrogen atoms around the equator of another Qn. Force-field calculations on guest@Qn complexes were conducted to determine the mechanism for the formation of these complexes. A comparison of the intermolecular interactions of phenylated systems and comparable fluorinated phenyl systems was made using both crystal packing analyses and forcefield energy calculations. Intermolecular energy parameters for these calculations were derived and validated in this work. The principal fluorinated species studied was the [B(C6F5)4]?anion. Examination of its crystal structures found that the substitution of the hydrogen atoms by fluorine atoms is influential enough to alter the predominant  intramolecular conformation. It is the ???flipper?conformer, between pairs of perfluorophenyl groups, that is overwhelmingly the favoured conformation and this has a strong effect on the types of phenyl embraces that a [B(C6F5)4]?anion will form. While the parallel 4PFE, the offset parallel 4PFE and the orthogonal 4PFE are all observed the 6PFE is not.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Supramolecular chemistry</field><field name="subject">Macrocyclic compounds</field><field name="subject">Chemistry, Analytic -- Technique</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26990</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of aldosterone in myocardial remodelling</field><field name="creator">Kotlyar, Eugene, St Vincents Hospital Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">The pathophysiology of cardiac failure involves activation of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system that contributes to adverse left ventricular remodelling. This is a complex pathologic process that has been shown to be stimulated by haemodynamic and humoral factors including aldosterone. The precise mechanisms by which aldosterone contributes to this process are not known. In a mouse animal model of pressure overload induced cardiac hypertrophy and failure, the treatment with selective mineralocorticoid receptor, eplerenone, was shown to attenuate adverse left ventricular remodelling. This was associated with decreases in myocardial apoptosis, collagen turnover, oxidative stress and inflammation, in the absence of a significant blood pressure change. Furthermore, we administered aldosterone infusion and high salt diet to uninephrectomised mice deficient in the gp91phox subunit of NADPH oxidase and to the wild type strain. It was demonstrated that the increase in the blood pressure did not occur in the gp91phox deficient mice and that both wild-type and knock-out strains developed cardiac hypertrophy, but not interstitial fibrosis. Additionally, patients with chronic stable heart failure were also studied. We found that plasma aldosterone level was independently associated with levels of markers for oxidative stress (of 8- isoprostaglandin F2??), inflammation (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1) and matrix turnover (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1). High plasma osteopontin levels were also noted. Our experiments suggest that myocardial apoptosis, collagen turnover, oxidative stress and inflammation may be involved in mediating the adverse effects of mineralocorticoid receptor activation in pressure overload. In addition, the development of cardiac hypertrophy may be a haemodynamically independent process, but gp91phox subunit deficiency did not attenuate the hypertrophic response to aldosterone infusion when administered in conjunction with high salt diet, suggesting that there may be another mechanism that mediates aldosterone-induced hypertrophy. The state of increased oxidative stress and inflammation, seen in animal models, may also play an important role in chronic heart failure subjects. The importance of local factors in the regulation of myocardial tissue remodelling has become increasingly evident, but future investigations are required to clarify the role of aldosterone, oxidative stress and inflammation in heart failure.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aldosterone</field><field name="subject">Myocardium</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being somewhere: young homeless people in inner-city Sydney</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Catherine , Social Policy Research Centre, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Drawing on in-depth interviews, participant observation and my experiences of working with young homeless people in refuges, in this thesis I develop an analysis which identifies some key spatial practices through which young people negotiate the field of homelessness in inner-city Sydney. The particular contribution of this work is to consider homelessness in terms of a theorised understanding of the broader role of place within homelessness, rather than in terms of the immediacy of cause or solution. While acknowledging the importance of the large body of work which has focused on the structural causes of homelessness and the need for a clear policy-oriented definition of homelessness, I develop an alternative agenda for a focus on young homeless people's struggles to feel 'in place' and 'at home'. These struggles throw into relief the need to understand young people???s homelessness in terms of a search, not just for a place to stay, but for a place to belong. Utilising the rich body of work which explores the important relation of place and subjectivity, I connect young people???s experiences of place within homelessness with the broader social and phenomenological concepts of ???displacement??? and ???implacement???. In particular, I focus on the spatial relations through which young people construct and organise their daily paths and begin to make sense of their often painful and chaotic lives and their fears about the future. I contextualise their fragile experiences of being somewhere in a broader spatial structure of constant movement and grief and feelings of alienation from the wider community. I consider the enduring role of past homes in their continuing struggle to piece together a way of ???being at home??? both in terms of drawing together a network of physical places of safety and in terms of experiencing a sense of acceptance, recognition and rootedness through place. I point to the critical need to include broader understandings of both home and homelessness in addressing the displacement which shapes the experience of homelessness for young people and impacts on the success of immediate measures developed to respond to it.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Homeless youth -- New South Wales -- Sydney -- Social conditions.</field><field name="subject">Homelessness -- New South Wales -- Sydney.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/36679</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of cohesive crack fracture parameters using mathematical programming</field><field name="creator">Que, Norbert S., Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the characterisation of the parameters governing the tension-softening relations of the cohesive crack model. Parameter identification is an important area in fracture mechanics as it enables the use of a fracture model for the simulation of fracture processes in structures. Research, however, has shown that such a task is not trivial and continues to pose challenging problems to experimentalists and analysts alike. This dissertation presents general and efficient indirect methods for the characterisation of mode I fracture parameters defining the cohesive crack model. The identification problem is formulated as a special type of inverse problem. The formulation is in the form of a constrained optimisation problem known as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints characterised, in the present instance, by complementarity conditions involving the orthogonality of two-sign constrained vectors. The solution of such a mathematical program is computationally challenging as it is disjunctive and nonconvex by nature. A number of nonlinear programming based approaches are proposed, after appropriate reformulation of the mathematical program as an equivalent nonlinear programming problem. Actual experimental data are used to validate and determine the most suitable algorithm for parameter identification. It was found that the smoothing-based method is by far superior than other schemes. As the problem is nonconvex and the nonlinear program can only guarantee a local or stationary point, global optimisation procedures are introduced in order to verify the accuracy of the solutions obtained by the algorithm. Two evolutionary search methods capable of finding the global optimum are implemented for parameter identification. The results generated by the evolutionary search techniques confirm the reliability of the solutions identified by the best nonlinear programming algorithm. All computations carried out in the thesis suggest the suitability and robustness of the selected algorithm for parameter identification.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cohesive crack</field><field name="subject">fracture parameters</field><field name="subject">cohesion</field><field name="subject">fracture mechanics</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19189</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feeling the future: the role of current emotions in affective forecasting</field><field name="creator">Laham, Simon M., Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to examine the effects of people???s current moods and emotions on affective forecasting. The primary hypothesis was mood congruence: people currently feeling happy were expected to generate relatively positive affective forecasts and people currently feeling sad were expected to generate relatively negative forecasts compared to people currently in a neutral state. In addition, a moderated mood congruence hypothesis, predicted by the Affect Infusion Model (AIM, Forgas, 1995), stating that mood congruence effects are more pronounced under conditions of constructive processing, was tested. Two secondary hypotheses concerning the processing and motivational consequences of transient moods were also examined in each of the studies in this thesis. Studies 1 to 3 examined these hypotheses using a variety of manipulations of constructive processing. In Study 1, happy, neutral and sad participants made affective forecasts about a variety of everyday events, under overt instructions to process constructively or not. In Study 2, the ambiguity of the forecast was the manipulation of constructive processing. In Study 3, Need for Cognition, was used as a measure of constructive processing. Results of Studies 1-3, however, did not support either the mood congruence or the moderated mood congruence hypotheses. Further, neither of the secondary hypotheses was supported. Studies 4 and 5 examined the influence of transient high arousal emotions on affective forecasts. In Study 4, anxious or neutral people forecasted their feelings about an upcoming public speaking engagement and also rated their willingness to give a public speech. Study 5 replicated and extended Study 4 by examining how happy, sad and angry  participants made those same predictions. In both Study 4 and 5, anxious people made more pessimistic forecasts and were less likely to engage in a public speech than were neutrals. This effect did not generalize to anger. Results suggest that while anxiety does have implications for affective forecasting and decision making, lower intensity moods and anger do not. Implications of these results are discussed with a focus on the benefits of an emotion-specific approach to the study of affect and affective forecasting.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">emotions</field><field name="subject">forecasting</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ultrastructure of Dentine Carious Lesions</field><field name="creator">Zavgorodniy, Alexander</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dentine</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of auditory-visual speech perception in young children</field><field name="creator">Erdener, Vahit Dogu</field><field name="description">Unlike auditory-only speech perception, little is known about the development of auditory-visual speech perception. Recent studies show that pre-linguistic infants perceive auditory-visual speech phonetically in the absence of any phonological experience. In addition, while an increase in visual speech influence over age is observed in English speakers, particularly between six and eight years, this is not the case in Japanese speakers. This thesis aims to investigate the factors that lead to an increase in visual speech influence in English speaking children aged between 3 and 8 years. The general hypothesis of this thesis is that age-related, language-specific factors will be related to auditory-visual speech perception. Three experiments were conducted here. Results show that in linguistically challenging periods, such as school onset and reading acquisition, there is a strong link between auditory visual and language specific speech perception, and that this link appears to help cope with new linguistic challenges. However this link does not seem to be present in adults or preschool children, for whom auditory visual speech perception is predictable from auditory speech perception ability alone. Implications of these results in relation to existing models of auditory-visual speech perception and directions for future studies are discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">auditory-visual speech perception</field><field name="subject">psycholinguistics</field><field name="subject">speech perception</field><field name="subject">auditory perception</field><field name="subject">visual perception</field><field name="subject">human information processing</field><field name="subject">speech development in children</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/13783</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modulation of tear lipocalin by phosphodiesterase inhibitors and steroid hormones</field><field name="creator">Evans, Victoria E.</field><field name="description">This project focussed on a protein called tear lipocalin that is believed to interact with the lipid layer of the tears and to promote tear film stability. By modulating this protein, it was proposed that tear film stability could be increased, hence the modulation of lipocalin was suggested as a goal for dry eye therapy. The effects on tear lipocalin expression of two potential therapies for dry eye, pharmacological stimulation with phosphodiesterase inhibitors and hormonal regulation with aldosterone and oestrogen HRT were investigated. Initially a rabbit model was employed and the rabbit tear protein profile was characterised. Stimulation of rabbit secretion using phosphodiesterase compounds did not alter rabbit tear lipocalin secretion. Clinical trial of phosphodiesterase compounds in humans did not alter tear lipocalin expression but variation in tear lipocalin isoform expression was noted and new isoforms of tear lipocalin were identified. The steroid hormone aldosterone appeared to modulate rabbit lipocalin and low MW protein expression. A clinical trial to examine the effect of gender, menopause and oestrogen hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on lipocalin secretion demonstrated that oestrogen HRT down regulated lipocalin secretion, increased the thickness of the lipid layer and improved symptomatology compared to the untreated menopause group. High levels of tear lipcalin in the menopause group were associated with symptoms of ocular burning, suggesting that increasing tear lipocalin levels might aggravate the ocular symptoms associated with dry eye. In this thesis it was demonstrated that tear lipocalin secretion was modulated by steroid hormones, but did not appear to be modulated by phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Variation in tear lipocalin concentration did not correlate with measures of tear film stability and indeed, high levels of tear lipocalin may be deleterious for dry eye symptoms. Further analysis of tear a stimulants and hormones will lead to better understanding of tear regulation and will open avenues for dry eye therapy. The application of proteomic tools to tear film will advance our understanding of tear film composition and the role each component in tear film stability.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lipocalin</field><field name="subject">ocular</field><field name="subject">oestrogen</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A multi-attribute evaluation of education outcomes for students who attend three Australian special schools</field><field name="creator">Dowrick, Margaret</field><field name="description">The absence of information that identifies desirable learning outcomes for students who attend Australian special schools and the absence of data that demonstrate the levels of mastery students have attained during their scholastic years, leave special education service provision vulnerable.

This study sought to investigate the impact of cultural and linguistic diversity on analgesic administration practices and opioid consumption during postoperative period. A retrospective medical record audit of 278 English-speaking and non-English speaking surgical patients was carried out at four hospitals in Sydney's South West. No differences were found in the type of analgesia prescribed, the mode of analgesia, or the commencement of oral analgesia between the two groups. However, non-English speaking patients consumed less analgesia during the initial postoperative period than their English speaking counterparts. The importance of this difference was further examined within the context of a range of factors known to influence analgesia consumption. A model including sociodemographic and clinical factors - mode of administration of analgesia, gender, and language spoken -predicted 37% of total opioid consumption. Although mode of administration was the most important factor, being of non-English speaking background also contributed substantially. Pain assessment, inclusive of gender and cultural nuances is recommended.

In keeping with this standpoint, it employs a range of approaches from a cross-paradigm perspective. It draws the main hypothesis that it tests from the cognitive developmental paradigm and develops its main methodological tools from methods of discourse analysis, supplemented by a variety of other instruments, quantitative as well as qualitative. This thesis makes five main claims: (1). Modality judgements, issues and perceptions in relation to television programme content are significant elements in a complex, active and creative process of learning for children in the contemporary world. (2). Children's modality judgements and processes of understanding are significantly different from those of adults in important respects. (3). A further significant developmentally-related phenomenon that emerges from the data is the importance of moments of rupture in developing modality schema and strategies. (4). Children's programme preferences, as refracted through modality structures and strategies typical of different ages, reflect a coherent learning context in which children tackle modality experiences, problems and dilemmas that are well suited to their needs at that point in their development. (5). Children's talk about issues of modality is also a species of social action, in and through which children position and reposition themselves in a variety of social contexts, constructing not only maps and versions of the world, but versions of their selves and tactics to maintain their specific interests. Many of the generalisations in this thesis are still tentative, in need of further development. Some of them, however, are more solidly grounded and would be able to contribute to current debates in education and public life on the role and functions of television in the lives of children.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">television and children</field><field name="subject">children's television in Australia</field><field name="subject">social aspects of children and television</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/60</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emergency nurses stress support and burnout</field><field name="creator">Eagar, Sandy</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the responses of one hundred and seventy three nurses who work in emergency departments in New South Wales to the psychological tenets of stress, support and burnout.

Overall nurses who work in emergency departments in NSW reported that the lack of in-patient beds or exit block was the most significant stressor in their work, followed by interruptions by telephones and uncontrolled volumes of patients. Although a variety of formal support systems available to emergency nurses were identified in this study a there was not universal agreement about their usefulness.

However, delivering viable probiotics to the host intestine has been a challenge due to poor survival of these bacteria during the gastric transit. An improved oral delivery system (modified alginate microcapsules) was developed in this study for targeted release of viable probiotics to the host intestine. Effect of various encapsulation parameters such as capsule size, alginate concentration, calcium chloride concentration, gelling/hardening time of microcapsules, addition of prebiotics and polymer coating, were individually investigated for improving the stability of microcapsules under simulated gastrointestinal (GI) conditions. Ability of microcapsules in protecting the viability of encapsulated bacteria improved significantly (p&lt;0.05) in improving the stability of microcapsules. Optimisation of encapsulation parameters significantly improved the viability of encapsulated probiotics under simulated GI conditions. Furthermore, co-encapsulation of probiotics with complementary prebiotics (such as Hi-Maize starch) and chitosan coating provided additional protection to the encapsulated bacteria under simulated GI conditions. Release profile of chitosan-coated alginate-starch (CCAS) encapsulated bacteria was investigated in the GI tracts of different animal models. Addition of CCAS encapsulated bacteria to porcine GI contents (ex vivo) resulted in complete release of microencapsulated bacteria in the ileal contents within 8 h, while there was no significant release (p&gt;0.05) of encapsulated bacteria in the gastric contents even after 24 h of incubation. In another experiment, CCAS microcapsules containing Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LCS) was orally administered to mice and the release profile of encapsulated bacteria was monitored throughout the murine GI tract for 24 h. Partial release of microencapsulated LCS was observed in duodenal and jejunal regions, while no significant (p&gt;0.05) release of microencapsulated bacteria was observed in the stomach during the 24 h monitoring period. However, a significant release (nearly complete release) of microencapsulated bacteria was observed in ileal and colon of murine GI tract after 24 h. Elevated counts of LCS in ileum and colon indicated the most favorable site for the release of CCAS encapsulated bacteria. Further studies investigated the immunomodulatory activity of microencapsulated probiotic bacteria in a murine model. Lactobacillus casei Shirota was orally administered to mice either as microencapsulated or as free bacteria (non encapsulated) for two weeks. On day 14, the splenocytes from different experimental groups were harvested and assessed for ConA induced cytokine levels. A significant increase (p&gt;0.05) in IFN-&#947; levels was observed in the activated splenocytes of groups treated with microencapsulated and free (non-encapsulated) LCS, compared to the control group (no LCS treatment). However, there was no significant difference (p&lt;0.05) in the IFN-&#947; concentration between the groups treated with microencapsulated and free (non-encapsulated) LCS. No significant difference (p&lt;0.05) in the IL-10 concentration was observed in the activated splenocytes of groups treated with microencapsulated and free (non-encapsulated) LCS. Finally, the stability of microencapsulated probiotics in different dairy products was investigated. CCAS microcapsules significantly protected the viability of probiotic bacteria in set and stirred yoghurts over 6-week refrigerated storage conditions compared to free (non-encapsulated) probiotics. Overall, chitosan-coated alginate-starch microcapsules developed in this study effectively protected the viability of probiotics from adverse gastric conditions and released the bacteria in the host intestine without detrimentally affecting its immunomodulatory properties.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microencapsulation</field><field name="subject">lactobacillus</field><field name="subject">probiotics</field><field name="subject">therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">bifidobacterium</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/39088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seed biology and rehabilitation in the arid zone : a study in the Shark Bay world heritage area, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Commander, Lucy</field><field name="description">Research into seed biology and restoration ecology of areas disturbed by mining is crucial to their revegetation. Shark Bay Salt, a solar salt facility in the Shark Bay World Heritage Area in Western Australia has several areas of disturbance as a result of 'soil borrowing'. Soil from these areas termed 'borrow pits' was used to create infrastructure such as the roads and embankments surrounding the evaporation ponds. Many of the pits contain little to no vegetation after &gt;10 years since disturbance ceased, hence research into their restoration is now essential. A vegetation survey at the site established the key species in the undisturbed vegetation, and investigated the vegetation in borrow pits subject to natural migration and topsoil replacement. The vegetation communities in the borrow pits were vastly different to those in the undisturbed vegetation, highlighting the need for research into revegetation. An investigation into the use of 'borrowed' topsoil on a small scale showed that seedling recruitment from 'borrowed' topsoil was generally similar in the donor site (natural vegetation) and the borrow pits. Due to the absence of topsoil for further revegetation, it was necessary to understand seed germination and dormancy characteristics to establish seed pre-treatments prior to seed broadcasting and seedling (greenstock) planting. An investigation into seed germination and dormancy characteristics of 18 common species revealed that most species germinated equally well at 26/13oC and 33/18oC, however seven species had improved performance at 26/13oC. Untreated seeds of seven species exhibited high germination. Seeds of two species had low imbibition, which increased with hot-water treatment, and hence require scarification for germination. Germination of seeds of three species substantially increased with gibberellic acid (GA3), smoke water (SW) and karrikinolide (KAR1, a butenolide isolated from smoke). Seeds of the remaining six species had low germination regardless of treatment. As a result, species were classified as likely to be non-dormant (44%), physiologically dormant (44%) or physically dormant (11%). Physiological dormancy of three species was at least partly alleviated by dry afterripening, whereby moisture content of seeds was adjusted to 13% or 50% equilibrium relative humidity and seeds were stored at 30oC or 45oC for several months. All iv after-ripening conditions increased germination percentage and rate of two species with one only germinating when treated with GA3 or KAR1. The germination of the third species was dependent on after-ripening temperature and seed moisture content.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Germination</field><field name="subject">Restoration ecology -- Western Australia -- Shark Bay</field><field name="subject">Revegetation -- Western Australia -- Shark Bay</field><field name="subject">Seeds -- Dormancy -- Western Australia -- Shark Bay</field><field name="subject">Soils -- Arid regions</field><field name="subject">Vegetation dynamics -- Western Australia -- Shark Bay</field><field name="subject">Shark Bay (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Seed biology</field><field name="subject">Shark Bay World Heritage area</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Arid zone</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0091</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of porosity and root growth in a sodic texture-contrast soil</field><field name="creator">Jassogne, Laurence</field><field name="description">In Australia a class of soils known as sodic duplex soils covers approximately 20% of the continent. Their defining characteristic is a sharp texture contrast between the A (or E) and B horizon. The upper B horizon at the point of contact with the E horizon is often highly sodic and of such a high strength that root growth and proliferation, water conductivity, aeration, water storage and water uptake are restricted. Roots growing in these soils rely on channels created by previous roots or cracks arising from shrink&#150; swell forces associated with seasonal wetting and drying. It has been suggested that by increasing the number of these channels in the subsoil, the structure and permeability of the subsoil would be increased as would be the number of preferential pathways for following generation roots. A biological approach for improving soil macroporosity would be to use plants that can grow through that hostile layer creating new channels. This is known as the primer plant concept. This concept is based on a better understanding of root soil interactions. It is accepted that root growth is influenced by the soil structure and the soil structure is influenced by root growth. However, a lot of these dynamics are still unknown. This project aims to contribute to improving that knowledge by investigating the use of modern techniques to study plant/root interactions in duplex soils. First macroporosity and mesoporosity were characterized in three dimensions using medical computer tomography and micro-tomography. Then the imaging methodology was improved by using a local and adaptive threshold technique based on indicator kriging instead of a global threshold. Using this new methodology, changes in porosity were analysed in intact samples when three different plant species were grown for 12 weeks. The plants were canola (Brassica napus); lucerne (Medicago sativum) and saltbush (Atriplex nummularia) hypothesizing saltbush would change the porosity more because it is a native plant species based on the primer plant concept. The results showed that the porosity changed significantly after root growth but no ii differences were found between plant species. The changes could also not all be attributed to root growth because cracks were also formed after 12 weeks. Therefore, the living roots were visualized and characterized using a new tracing algorithm 'rootviz'. This revealed that saltbush was growing more roots down through the profile. Lucerne seemed to grow roots down the profile as well but to a lesser extend. Both of these plants seemed to have more geotropic features than canola that seemed to grow more laterals and had a more exploratory behaviour.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Growth (Plants)</field><field name="subject">Plant-soil relationships</field><field name="subject">Roots (Botany)</field><field name="subject">Soil structure</field><field name="subject">Soil structure</field><field name="subject">Roots</field><field name="subject">Computer tomography</field><field name="subject">3-D imaging</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0092</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Calming the ocular storm : the effect of corticosteroids in inflammatory oedema</field><field name="creator">Banz, Kelly</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this research is to test the therapeutic potential of certain new generation corticosteroid drugs in order to develop safe and effective treatment for eye diseases that result in oedema, or swelling.  The rising incidence of diabetes and the ageing population of developed countries mean that the prevalence of uveitis, diabetic retinopathy and age related macular degeneration will rise. Often, oedema is one of the reasons for vision loss. Corticosteroids are often used to reduce inflammation. Inflammation is one of several sources of oedema. Glucocorticoids, a class of corticosteroids that have anti-inflammatory properties, are thus used to treat ocular oedema. There is an unmet need to support clinical experience of the efficacy of steroids for ocular inflammation and oedema with more substantial scientific evidence. None of the drugs under investigation, with the exceptions of dexamethasone and triamcinolone, have been used for any ocular therapeutic purpose before. This thesis investigates &#147;repurposing&#148; fludrocortisone to the ophthalmic area. 11-Desoxycorticosterone (11D) and Deoxycorticosterone (DCS), other potentially valuable mineralocorticoids, remain completely untested. Lastly, Kenacort &#174;, or triamcinolone acetonide (TCA), is only used off-label by ophthalmologists. Methods: In the first study, corticosteroids, and especially mineralocorticoids, were investigated for their treatment efficacy in experimental uveitis, or intraocular inflammation (using a model known as endotoxin induced uveitis). In the second study, endothelial cells from choroidal blood vessels in the back of the eye were used in vitro to study whether  corticosteroids reduce paracellular (between cells) permeability. Lastly, since endophthalmitis due to frequent injections is a side effect of corticosteroid use, the pharmacokinetics of different size formulations of corticosteroids were studied in an effort to find a formula that would have a prolonged dwell time within the eye.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eye -- Diseases -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Eye -- Inflammation</field><field name="subject">Ocular pharmacology</field><field name="subject">Therapeutics, Ophthalmological</field><field name="subject">Uveitis</field><field name="subject">Uveitis</field><field name="subject">Steroids</field><field name="subject">Ocular oedema</field><field name="subject">Animal model</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0093</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imagining 'environment' in Australian suburbia : an environmental history of the suburban landscapes of Canberra and Perth, 1946-1996</field><field name="creator">Brown, Sarah</field><field name="description">Australia is a suburban nation. Today, with increasing concern regarding the sustainability of cities, an appreciation of the complexities of Australian suburbia is critical to the debate about urban futures. As a built environment and a cultural phenomenon, the Australian suburbs have inspired considerable scholarly literature. Yet to date, such scholarly work has largely overlooked the changing environmental values and visions of those shaping and residing within suburban landscapes, and the practices through which such values and visions are materialised in the processes of suburban development.  Focusing on the post-war suburban landscapes of Canberra and Perth, this thesis centralises the environmental, political and economic forces that have shaped human action to construct suburban spaces, paying particular attention to the extent to which individual understandings and visions of 'environment' have determined the shape and nature of suburban development. Specifically, it examines how those operating within Australia&#146;s suburbs, including planners, developers, builders, landscape designers and residents have imagined the 'environment', and how such imaginaries have shifted in response to varying spatial, temporal and ideological contexts. Tracing the shifting nature of environmental concern throughout the mid-to-late twentieth century, it argues that despite the somewhat unsustainable nature of Australia's suburban landscapes, the planning and development of such landscapes has long been influenced by and has responded to differing understandings of 'environment', which themselves are the product of changing social, political and economic concerns.  In doing so, this thesis challenges a number of perceptions concerning Australian suburbs, environmental awareness and sustainability. In particular, it contests the assumption that environmental concern for Australia's suburban development emerged with the urban consolidation debates of the 1980s and 1990s, and analyses a range of environmental sensibilities not often acknowledged in current histories of Australian environmentalism. By examining, for example, how the deterministic and economic concerns of differing planning bodies, along with the aesthetic and ecological concerns of various planners, are intertwined with the housing and domestic lifestyle preferences of suburban homeowners, this history brings to the fore the often conflicting environmental ideas and practices that arise in the course of suburban development, and provides a more nuanced history of the diversity of environmental sensibilities. In sum, this thesis enhances our understandings of the changing nature of environmental concern and illuminates the complex, still largely misunderstood, environmental ideas and practices that arise in the processes of suburban development.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australians -- Social life and customs</field><field name="subject">City planning -- Australian Capital Territory -- Canberra</field><field name="subject">City planning -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Suburban life -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Suburbs -- Environmental aspects -- Australian Capital Territory -- Canberra</field><field name="subject">Suburbs -- Environmental aspects -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Perth (W.A.) -- Social conditions -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Canberra (A.C.T.) -- Social conditions</field><field name="subject">Environmental history</field><field name="subject">Canberra</field><field name="subject">Perth</field><field name="subject">Suburbs, urban</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0094</field></doc><doc><field name="title">His story, a novel memoir (novel) ; and Fish out of water (thesis)</field><field name="creator">Gray, Nigel,</field><field name="description">His Story takes the form of a fictive but autobiographically based investigation into the child and young adult I used to be, and follows that protagonist into early adulthood. It tries to show the damage done to that character and the way in which he damaged others in turn. As Hemingway said, We are all bitched from the start and you especially have to hurt like hell before you can write seriously. More importantly, the main protagonist is somebody who became concerned with, and cognizant of the main political and social events of his day. His life is set in its social context, and reaches out to the larger issues. That is to say, the personal events of the protagonist's life are recorded alongside and set in the context of the major events taking place on the world stage. The manuscript is some sort of hybrid of novel, autobiography, and historical and social document. As Isaac Bashevis Singer said, The serious writer of our time must be deeply concerned about the problems of his generation. In order to make His Story effective in sharing my ideas and beliefs, and, of course, in order to protect the innocent and more particularly, the guilty, it is created in the colourful area that is the overlap between memory and fiction. When we tell the stories of our lives to others, and indeed, to ourselves, we prise them out of memory's fingers and transform them into fiction. To write autobiography well, as E.L.

Any narrative of the displacement of religion by a universal and secularising modernity fails to recognise the complexity of the historical and cultural realities. While modernity has demonstrably contributed to the erosion of certain forms of religion, there is a growing body of evidence, and new interpretations of existing evidence, which suggest that the interconnections between modernity and religion are far more complex than any simple opposition could account for. Indeed, modernity appears, in certain circumstances, to be capable of producing its own religious effects. This thesis seeks to answer what then becomes a fundamental question: what does it mean for the study of religion if we accept that modernity can generate the religious? 
 New conceptual tools are needed to deal critically with the far-reaching consequences of embracing the true density of modernity. The study of religion can be greatly enhanced by one such concept: reenchantment. However, reenchantment, as an interpretive framework, must be carefully formulated. Reenchantment cannot be properly understood as a reversal of disenchantment, a conception this thesis will be calling thin reenchantment, but as an ongoing dialectic of reenchantment and rationalisation, which this thesis will be calling thick reenchantment. The formulation of a credible and useful concept of reenchantment can in turn be aided by the work of the philosopher and cultural critic Jean Baudrillard. Baudrillard&#65533;s work is not itself an expression or example of reenchantment, but it demonstrates a remarkable congruence with the concept of thick reenchantment, as both interrogate dominant understandings of modernity in relationship to differing systems of value. 
 The thesis is divided into two sections. The first, substantially longer, section presents in some detail thick reenchantment as an interpretive frame. Though it does not claim to offer any new evidence, the first chapter outlines the evidential background for the thesis, which adopts the concept of religious modernity, developed by sociologist Danie&#768;le Hervieu-Le&#769;ger, as a way of framing this evidence. The second chapter develops the concept of reenchantment and the typology of thin and thick reenchantment in relation to the foundational work of Max Weber. The third chapter is an analysis and review of the extant multidisciplinary discourse on reenchantment. The fourth chapter, the theoretical core of the thesis, presents an innovative reading of Baudrillard&#65533;s considerable body of work. 
 The second section elaborates on a further insight of the first - that text is a necessary element in the study of religious modernity - by offering detailed readings of the work of three contemporary authors - novelists Douglas Coupland and Chuck Palahniuk and filmmaker Tom Tykwer - as instantiations of the sorts of cultural artefacts that the conceptual framework of thick reenchantment means to explore. 
 Though its claims remain conceptual and interpretive rather than evidential, normative, or explanatory, this thesis, interdisciplinary as it is, is intended as a contribution to a number of related fields, from the study of contemporary literature and film to the exploration of Baudrillard&#65533;s work, which the study of religion has to date largely neglected, to its detriment However, its primary purpose is to suggest new and fruitful ways to approach the study of religion in modernity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">religion and sociology</field><field name="subject">religion and culture</field><field name="subject">Jean Baudrillard (1929-2007)</field><field name="subject">Douglas Coupland</field><field name="subject">Chuck Palahniuk</field><field name="subject">Tom Tykwer</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090218.141700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of photoinhibition in the obligate shade plant ginseng</field><field name="creator">Woods, Matthew Alan</field><field name="description">Obligate shade plants possess adaptations that enable them to photosynthesise in the low light environment of the forest floor. Adaptations that facilitate light scavenging may compromise capacity for high rates of photosynthesis. This study compares the responses of obligate shade and facultative shade plant species upon exposure to elevated light. The obligate shade plants were two commercially grown medicinal herb species of ginseng, Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer and Panax quinquefolius L.; and goldenseal - Hydrastis canadensis L. Comparison was made to Arabidopsis thaliana and Pisum sativum L. as facultative shade species. Panax ginseng (Korean ginseng) and Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng) are obligate shade plants found in broadleaf forests of Eastern Asia and North America, respectively. Studies on these plants have shown optimal growth at light intensities between 200-300 [mu]mol photons. m&#8315;&#65533;. s&#8315;&#65533;, or 10-15% of full sunlight, and at intensities greater than 500 [mu]mol photons. m&#8315;&#65533;. s&#8315;&#65533; characteristic photoinbibitory symptoms develop. An atypical response to methyl viologen in photosynthetic electron transport assays was observed in ginseng in both isolated thylakoid membranes and whole leaves. No correlation was found between detectable superoxide dismutase activity and altered methyl viologen reactions. In a mutagenesis study using the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, a unique amino acid residue in the terminal electron acceptor PsaC, found only in ginseng, was changed and found to have no effect on methyl viologen reactions. Electron transfer to methyl viologen was examined in both isolated thylakoid membranes and whole leaves using chlorophyll a fluorescence and the apparent ability for methyl viologen to act as an electron acceptor was observed to differ between ginseng species. Obligate shade species were observed to possess alternate pools of photosystem II centres that potentially provide a mechanism to maximise photosynthetic gain under low light and during short periods of increased illumination. In experiments designed to identify physiological processes that contribute to increased susceptibility to photoinhibition in obligate shade plants, responses were observed and characterised following a moderate increase in illumination (140 to 400 [mu]mol photons. m&#8315;&#65533; . s&#8315;&#65533;) using chlorophyll a fluorescence induction curve analysis. The obligate shade species exhibited varied responses to elevated light and showed increased susceptibility, to photoinhibition. Photoprotective non-photochemical dissipative capacity was quantified and found to be comparable between all species studied.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ginseng</field><field name="subject">araliaceae</field><field name="subject">photoinhibition</field><field name="subject">photosynthesis</field><field name="subject">molecular aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090417.121807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand&#65533;s adventure culture : In Hillary&#65533;s steps : a Bourdieusian exploration</field><field name="creator">Kane, Maurice J</field><field name="description">Historically adventure has been associated with successful, yet, dangerous endeavours that expand the knowledge, wealth, reputation, or safety of society. Previous research would suggest that the practices and stories of adventure have guided and benchmarked societal morals and ideas considered common &#65533;truths&#65533;. In New Zealand, society&#65533;s understandings of adventure are entwined with a mythologised cultural identity based on the egalitarian minded and physically active, outdoor pioneering male. These ideals were complimented and presented as a global representation of New Zealand by Sir Edmund Hillary&#65533;s successful climb of Mount Everest in 1953. The purpose of this thesis is to examine New Zealand&#65533;s understandings of adventure since 1953. The thesis centres its enquiry on a group of individuals who have obtained social distinction as adventurers, seeking to scrutinize in their adventure practice and narratives, adventure understandings that are legitimised or invalidated. 
 Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu&#65533;s theoretical concepts guide the enquiry approach. Bourdieu sought to transcend the false antinomy of sociology that presented dualist perspectives, such as the individual and society, conceptualising all practice in a dynamic matrix of relational social space. The individuals with distinction as adventurers personify the socially recognised and valued features of adventure. Equally, however, an amalgamation of features does not infer a definitive understanding. The substance of understandings, Bourdieu suggests, is in the relational strategies, consistencies, transformations, and knowing misrecognitions that frame the features of a practice in a social space. The research process adopted to examine the adventure understandings was a biographical narrative approach. The contention of this approach being, that in stories of life experience individuals with adventure distinction construct self and social meaning. 
 The published autobiographical adventure narratives, media interviews, and related accounts of 12 New Zealand adventurers provided the initial research material. Additionally, nine of the adventurers took part in research interviews. The interpretation of the research material was framed by three of Bourdieu&#65533;s prominent conceptual ideas; the development of &#65533;habitus&#65533;, the struggle for &#65533;capital&#65533; in the field of adventre and the legitimacy of &#65533;distinction&#65533;. This interpretation was facilitated by theories related to adventure and leisure practice, the risks and contexts of adventure, and to individual, subcultural, and social identity. 
 By applying a Bourdieusian lens on the practice and narratives of New Zealand adventurers with distinction, this thesis illuminates new aspects of New Zealand&#65533;s cultural understandings of adventure. It revealed a contested and relational struggle to have some practices legitimised as adventure and others devalued as contrived common thrills, or fortuitously survived reckless epics. A practice that typifies the thrill spectrum is &#65533;Bungy Jumping&#65533;, the contemporary global representation of adventure in New Zealand. In regard of epic practices, topical through the period of adventure interviews was the 2004 motion picture &#65533;Touching the Void&#65533;. Although this involved English climbers in South America in the 1980s, it has retained global prominence as a modern adventure/survival epic. The interpretation of this contested adventure space details the valued and recognised features that construct New Zealand&#65533;s understandings of adventure. The findings also provide an empirical basis for the equally valued misrepresented adventure understandings related to injury, exclusivity, and normalisation of practice. Additionally, the research interpretation indicates the potential for transformation of adventure understandings. Finally, although the study is situated within a specific social and historical context, it contributes to the on-going exchange of meanings about adventure, especially in relation to outdoor practice, in contemporary society.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pierre Bourdieu (1930-2002)</field><field name="subject">sports and tourism</field><field name="subject">outdoor recreation</field><field name="subject">adventure and adventurers</field><field name="subject">social life and customs</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090422.141858</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Orf virus as a vaccine vector : manipulation of structural proteins for surface display of immunogenic peptides</field><field name="creator">Tan, Joanne Li-Ching</field><field name="description">Orf virus (ORFV) has the potential to be developed as a vaccine vector. Its ability to stimulate non-specific as well as specific immune responses in permissive and non-permissive hosts stands it in good stead to be utilised as such a tool. The fusion of immunogenic peptides to vaccinia virus (VACV) structural proteins have been shown to improve their immunogenicity due to presentation of the foreign antigens in a particulate form that can stimulate both B and T cells. The aims of this study were to fuse foreign antigens to ORFV structural proteins to demonstrate proof-of-concept that such surface display could also render the foreign antigens more immunogenic. 
 Little is known about ORFV structure and morphogenesis. When this study commenced, the ORFV genome had recently been sequenced and this revealed a large number of homologues in common with VACV. It was thus assumed that both viruses may share structural similarities and that ORFV also assumes the different morphological forms such as the mature virion (MV) and extracellular virion (EV) that are present in VACV. The MV and EV forms are both infectious, with the EV containing an additional membrane acquired from the trans-Golgi network during viral morphogenesis. Furthermore, specific viral proteins are associated with both the MV and EV membranes. 
 Six ORFV structural proteins ORFV 089, 10 kDa, F1, that are homologues of structural membrane proteins A13, A27 and H3 of VACV MVs, together with ORFV 109, ORFV 110 and B2, that are homologues of structural membrane proteins A33, A34 and F13 of VACV EVs were selected as possible candidates for manipulation. At present, there is some information available only for 10 kDa, F1 and B2. The 10 kDa is required for virus assembly, F1 for mediating cell attachment while B2 has been shown to induce significant antibody responses in sheep. Indeed proteomic analyses predicted similarities in the topologies of all of these proteins with their VACV counterparts. 
 Using this information, preliminary studies were conducted to generate recombinant ORFVs (rORFVs) which had FLAG fused to the terminus of the protein that was exposed on the surface of the virus particle. Three rORFVs 10 kDa, F1L and 110 were successfully generated. Immunogold labelling of FLAG proteins on virus particles isolated from lysed cells showed that FLAG-10 kDa and FLAG-F1 were displayed on the surface of MV particles whereas FLAG-ORFV 110 could not be detected. Western blot analyses of solubilised recombinant ORFV 110-FLAG particles revealed that FLAG-ORFV 110 was abundant and undergoes post-translational modification indicative of endoplasmic reticulum trafficking whereas FLAG-10 kDa and FLAG-F1 did not appear to be subjected to post-translational modifications. Fluorescent microscopy confirmed the prediction that ORFV 110-FLAG localised to the Golgi in virus-infected cells and immunogold labelling of EVs showed that ORFV110-FLAG became exposed on the surface of EV-like particles as a result of egress from the cell, suggesting that the membranes had been acquired from the Golgi. These modifications also appeared to have minimal effect on the infectivity of these rORFVs. 
 The study was extended by replacing the small FLAG peptide with an immunogenic protein (EG95), derived from the oncosphere of the zoonotic parasite Echinococcus granulosus. This protein is known to confer protection in immunised animals. Three rORFVs were generated in which a truncated version of the protein, EG95[Delta]TM, was fused to 10 kDa in the absence (rORFV 699) or presence (rORFV 700) of a linker, and also to F1 (rORFV 701). Western blot analyses of these solubilised particles demonstrated that the fusion proteins appeared to be post-translationally modified while immunogold labelling using anti-EG95 monoclonal antibodies successfully demonstrated the surface labelling on these rORFVs. 
 In order to test the immunogenicity of these rORFVs, prime-boost experiments in sheep were conducted using rORFVs 699, 700 and 701 and a glutathione-S-transferase (GST-EG95) based vaccine. The results showed the production of EG95-specific antibodies. In particular, antibody production by group rORFV 701 compared favourably with a control group that was primed and boosted by GST-EG95 vaccine. This was despite the slightly slower growth rates of rORFVs 700 and 701 and the decreased infectivity of all three rORFVs discovered in in vitro experiments. 
 In conclusion, these studies indicated the feasibility of this strategy to manipulate ORFV structural proteins for use as an agent for vaccine delivery.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Orf virus</field><field name="subject">viral vaccines</field><field name="subject">peptides</field><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="subject">proteins</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090427.144304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing children&#65533;s responses to cross-examination questioning</field><field name="creator">O'Neill, Sarah Christine</field><field name="description">Under an adversarial legal system, witnesses&#65533; testimony may be challenged by the opposing lawyer during cross-examination. Cross-examination has been shown to negatively affect the accuracy of children&#65533;s event reports, but as yet, the mechanisms driving this effect are unknown. 
 Experiment 1 aimed to tease apart the roles of question type and repeated interviewing in mediating children&#65533;s cross-examination performance. Five- and 6-year-olds (N = 82) and 9- and 10-year-olds (N = 103) took part in a staged event, and 1 to 2 days later they took part in a direct examination interview. Next, either 1 to 3 days or 6 months later, all children were interviewed for a second time. For half of the children, this second interview was a repeat of their direct examination interview. The remaining children were interviewed in a cross-examination format. A second interview reduced response accuracy after both short and long delays, however, cross-examination questioning impaired the accuracy of children&#65533;s reports the most. 
 Although, overall, children have considerable difficulty answering cross-examination questions correctly, variation in their performance has been observed. Experiment 2 assessed whether individual differences in cognitive abilities mediate cross-examination performance. Five- and 6-year-olds (N = 116) and 9- and 10-year-olds (N = 58) visited the police station and subsequently reported their experiences in direct examination and cross-examination interviews. Children&#65533;s memory, receptive language ability, expressive language ability, and intelligence were also measured. Age, intelligence, and memory predicted aspects of cross-examination performance. Overall, these cognitive factors accounted for between 16.6% and 19.5% of the variance in cross-examination outcome measures. 
 Given the negative effect of cross-examination on children&#65533;s responding, and our inability to identify the children who are most at risk of poor performance during this interview, Experiment 3 assessed our ability to facilitate children&#65533;s responding to cross-examination questioning. Specifically, the effect of manipulating the timing of a pre-trial intervention, which gives children practice and feedback at cross-examination questioning, was investigated. Five- and 6-year-olds (N = 88) and 9- and 10-year-olds (N = 108) visited the police station. One to 3 days later they completed the direct examination interview and 6 months after the event, children were cross-examined. The timing of the preparation intervention was varied (1-day, 1-week, 1-month before cross-examination), and the children&#65533;s subsequent cross-examination performance was compared to that of children in the control group. When the preparation intervention was delivered 1 day or 1 week before the cross-examination interview, children&#65533;s cross-examination performance was significantly improved. 
 The findings from the three experiments suggest that cross-examination is likely to pose considerable problems for children, especially younger children. Our greater understanding of factors that influence children&#65533;s responding to cross-examination questioning may guide reform of the cross-examination process for child witnesses. Bottom-up initiatives, such as pre-trial preparation, and top-down changes, including educating professionals, expert testimony, and reducing the delay to cross-examination, may improve the reliability of child witnesses&#65533; testimony during cross-examination.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cross-examination</field><field name="subject">child witnesses</field><field name="subject">forensic psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090428.150450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From art souvenir to tourist kitsch : a cultural history of New Zealand Paua shell jewellery until 1981</field><field name="creator">van de Wijdeven, Petronella Johanna Maria</field><field name="description">This cultural history of paua shell jewellery redresses the lack of visibility of such objects as a significant part of 20th century New Zealand material culture and provides a basis for a more balanced interpretation beyond its stereotyping as tourist kitsch. It questions why quality paua shell jewellery made before the late 1960s failed to gain recognition with most New Zealanders until fairly recently as anything other than tourist souvenirs. 
 Over 1,500 items of paua shell jewellery, mainly in private collections, formed the basis for this multidisciplinary research project that incorporates historical, anthropological and material culture studies approaches to write a cultural history of such jewellery. The objects were photographed and where available, their provenance recorded. A visual analysis of the items - paying attention to details of design and construction - established various, often overlapping categories that facilitated the dating and identification process. Gradually, a picture of the production of paua shell jewellery over the decades emerged. The wider socio-cultural context was then built using archival sources, various publications, conversations with one-time industry representatives, and discussions with original owners of paua shell jewellery. Interpretation of the material established multiple roles for paua shell jewellery over the decades for various groups of people. 
 Changes over time provided insights into aspects of identity creation by New Zealanders. Until the 1920s, the shell&#65533;s main role had been as a European applied arts material and as inlay for Maori woodcarvings. Paua shell as a commercial souvenir material developed during the Depression and was shaped by the interaction between an emerging nationalism and a democratising of travel in New Zealand. Paua shell native bird brooches functioned as affordable alternatives to greenstone souvenirs for the working-class tourists that began exploring their own country. 
 In addition to its role as emblems of nationhood in the interwar years, paua shell jewellery had meaning as souvenirs for American servicemen stationed in New Zealand during the War, and as patriotic tokens for its own population due to its association with disabled servicemen. Paua shell jewellery functioned as acknowledgement of settlement for European immigrants in the post war era, and as travel memento for trans-Tasman tourists from the mid 1950s. New Zealand girls received paua shell items as first jewellery, and women wore it as dress or costume jewellery. 
 Until the increase of tourism in the 1960s, paua shell jewellery had existed on a number of planes. The exploitation of paua shell by the tourist industry, however, upset the balance and its dominance as souvenir forced a retreat of alternative uses. Other than as tourist souvenir, paua shell jewellery became invisible to the local population. Their withdrawal from an association with paua shell as a cultural marker of national identity explains why so many New Zealanders were uncertain about liking or disliking paua shell jewellery until recently.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">shell jewelry</field><field name="subject">shellcraft</field><field name="subject">souvenirs (keepsakes)</field><field name="subject">paua</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090429.162501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel fluorescent organometallic materials</field><field name="creator">Tagg, Woo Chiat</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the synthesis and properties of some extended donor-acceptor dyads with the donor being a ferrocenyl moiety and a fluorescent naphthalimide group as the acceptor. Two series of extended ferrocenyl-naphthalimide dyads were prepared in reasonable yield depending on the synthetic route. The first are a series of three ferrocenyl-CH=CH-spacer-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide dyads in which the spacers are phenyl, biphenyl and anthryl and the second are a series of three ferrocenyl-C[triple bond]C-spacer-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide dyads in which the spacers are 2,2&#65533; -bithiophene, 2,5-dimethoxybenzene and tetrafluorobenzene groups. 
 The molecular structures of some compounds have been determined by X-ray diffraction although with many challenges because of the extensive [pi]-[pi] stacking of molecules that leads to ready aggregation in the solid state, particularly for the ferrocenyl-CH=CH-spacer-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide dyads, in which the naphthalimide bears a methyl head group. In order to reduce the [pi]-[pi] stacking effect between the molecules and also to produce chiral molecules for the potential nonlinear optical applications, a chiral &#945;-methylbenzylamine was introduced as the head group of naphthalimide for the ferrocenyl-C[triple bond]C-spacer-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide dyads. The resulting comounds successfully gave crystals of sufficient quality for X-ray structural investigation. 
 While the oxidative electrochemistry of the ferrocenyl compound in the two series of dyads was largely predictable (E&#65533; ~ 0.55 V for ferrocenyl-CH=CH- and ~ 0.72 V for ferrocenyl-C[triple bond]C-), the presence of spacers in the dyads appeared to afford stability to the reduced naphthalimide species. This was exhibited by the appearance of chemically reversible one-electron reduction processes for each of the compounds investigated. Similar unusual chemical reversibility was also shown by the spacer-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide precursor systems. For the ferrocenyl-CH=CH-spacer-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide dyads, the oxidation and reduction potentials closely resembled those of the simple ferrocenyl-CH=CH-spacer systems. This suggested that augmentation of the simple ferrocenyl-CH=CH-phenyl, -biphenyl and -anthryl systems with an alkyne linked naphthalimide unit showed little influence on the oxidation of the ferrocenyl moiety or the reduction of the naphthalimide unit. However, for the ferrocenyl-C[triple bond]C-spacer-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide dyads, the oxidation and reduction potentials are influenced by the inductive effects of the spacers. While an anodic shift was observed for the dyad with the electron-withdrawing spacer tetrafluorobenzene, a cathodic shift was displayed for the dyads with the electron-donating spacers 2,2&#65533;-bithiophene and 2,5-dimethoxybenzene compared to that in the simple ferrocenyl-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide system. 
 The spectroscopic properties of the ferrocenyl-CH=CH-spacer-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide dyads showed that interpolation of the aromatic spacers does not interfere with the internal charge separation. Oxidation of the ferrocenyl moiety resulted in bleaching of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer band at ~ 500 nm and the growth of a new band in the near infrared region at ~ 1000 nm. This new band can be assigned to a ligand-to-metal charge transfer transition, where the ferrocenium now acts as an acceptor to the naphthalimide donor. 
 For the ferrocenyl-C[triple bond]C-spacer-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide dyads, the spectroscopic properties showed that the mutually electron-withdrawing tetrafluorobenzene and naphthalimide units had little interaction despite their connection by a conductive alkyne link. In contrast, the dyads containing the electron-donating 2,2&#65533;-bithiophene and 2,5-dimethoxybenzene showed some degree of interaction between the spacer and the naphthalimide fragments. This was evidenced by the appearance of a broad absorption band in the range 410 - 440 nm, which is associated with an orbital that is delocalised between the spacer and the naphthalimide fragments. Again, the roles of donor and acceptor were reversed on oxidation of the ferrocenyl moiety. This resulted in the growth of a new near infrared band at ~750 mn for the dyad containing the tetrafluorobenzene spacer and at ~ 1000 nm for the dyads with 2,2&#65533;-bithiophene and 2,5 -dimethoxybenzene spacers. The ferrocenyl unit went from being a net donor to ferrocenium, which was acting as an acceptor, with the tetrafluorobenzene spacer adopting the donor role more reluctantly than the delocalised 2,2&#65533;-bithiophene-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide and 2,5-dimethoxybenzene-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide moieties. 
 1,3,5-Tri- and 1,2,4,5-tetra-substituted benzene cores were also used as spacers for the preparation of extended arrays of ferrocenyl-naphthalimide dyads. Utilisation of the 1,3,5 -tri-substituted benzene core enabled the core to be embellished in three directions, resulting in Y-motif extended arrays containing either one ferrocenyl unit [(ethenylferrocenyl)-C&#8326;H&#8323;-(C[triple bond]C-C&#8326;H&#8325;)&#8322;] or one naphthalimide moiety [(4-piperidino-N-propargyl-naphthalimide)-C&#8326;H&#8323;-(Br)&#8322;]. With the 1,2,4,5-tetra-substituted benzene core, the extension of the core was possible in four directions and gave extended arrays in an X-motif. Again, these systems contained either ferrocenyl units [bis(alkoxyferrocenyl)-C&#8326;H&#8322;-(C[triple bond]C-C&#8326;H&#8325;)&#8322;] or naphthalimide moieties [(tetrakis-naphthalimide)-C&#8326;H&#8322;]. Attempts to incorporate both ferrocenyl and naphthalimide fragments into the X- or Y-motif extended arrays were unsuccessful. 
 By adding C&#8322;Co&#8322;(CO)&#8326;dppm across the triple bonds of two of the four alkyne groups in the X-motif naphthalimide system [(tetrakis-naphthalimide)-C&#8326;H&#8322;], it was possible to incorporate two oxidisable C&#8322;Co&#8322;(CO)&#8324;dppm cluster units into the molecule. The electrochemistry of the resulting system showed two discrete oxidation processes, suggesting the possibility of some interaction between the dicobalt cluster redox centres.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ferrocene</field><field name="subject">naphthalene</field><field name="subject">organometallic compounds</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090430.133100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An injury surveillance framework for the New Zealand construction industry</field><field name="creator">McCracken, Selwyn</field><field name="description">Background: The burden of fatal and non-fatal injury for the New Zealand construction industry is larger than most other industrial sectors. Injury preventions efforts for construction have however been hampered because of insufficient, industry-specific, surveillance data that is essential for the effective targeting and evaluation of interventions. 
 Aim: This thesis aimed to describe and test a feasible framework of Injury Surveillance for the New Zealand construction industry. Accordingly, the specific objectives to accomplish this aim were: To identify an optimal surveillance dataset for New Zealand construction injuries; To assess potential sources of data and collection methods; To describe an ideal study design for undertaking injury surveillance; To implement an operational design based on industry stakeholder input; To undertake and evaluate an injury surveillance trial; and To suggest how a viable surveillance system could be permanently established. 
 Method: A trial injury surveillance system was developed by identifying known construction injury risk factors from the literature, reviewing the data collection practices of the New Zealand industry and other potential data sources and consulting with industry stakeholders about the most feasible collection methodology. This surveillance framework was then tested by combining national data from routine Government sources and data from 3 construction companies that employed approximately 720 workers between them. National construction injury data was obtained from the Accident Compensation Corporation, the Department of Labour and the Injury Information Manager. The trial Surveillance System was then evaluated in terms of its ability to collect the full range of an optimal dataset, the quality and completeness of information actually collected, the ability to identify and monitor injury priorities for the industry, and the future viability and acceptability of this surveillance design to the industry. 
 Results: A total of 468 medically treated injuries were recorded by the participating companies, with 15 (3.2%) considered to be Serious Harm injuries as defined by the Health and Safety in Employment Act. The level of data completeness across companies was especially low, with on average 18 out of 34 data fields (53%) completely unrecorded. The data from one company was sufficiently complete (i.e. 63% across all fields) to allow individual risk factor analyses to be conducted, whereas the absence of complete denominator data prevented the completion of the same analyses for the other two companies. Viewed overall, Government agency data was sufficiently detailed to estimate national longitudinal trends, injury agency and mechanism priorities for specific occupations and industry subsectors, and allowed a rudimentary evaluation of a national intervention programme. However, questions about data accuracy, completeness and under-reporting were raised for each of the Government data sources used. 
 Conclusions: Using data entirely from Government sources appears to be the most immediately viable framework of Injury Surveillance for the New Zealand construction industry. As such, the relevant range of analyses demonstrated by this study should be continued, expanded and improved. In contrast, obtaining injury surveillance data from companies in the manner that was tested does not appear to feasible, given the difficulty in recruiting companies and the poor data completeness of those companies that did participate. However, the increased range of prevention targets identified by the company that did largely contribute data as intended, demonstrated that company surveillance had merit relative to existing procedures. Suggested steps toward implementing viable construction injury surveillance within New Zealand are outlined, including a recommendation to the industry&#65533;s Health and Safety organisation, SiteSafe, to investigate the most feasible data collection protocol for its members.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">industrial safety</field><field name="subject">industrial accidents</field><field name="subject">construction industry</field><field name="subject">safety measures</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090501.140407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HIV epidemiology and behavioural surveillance among men who have sex with men in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Saxton, Peter John Waring</field><field name="description">AIMS: HIV diagnoses among men who have sex with men (MSM) in New Zealand increased from the year 2001. The aim of the thesis was to improve understandings of the causes of the increase, in order to inform HIV prevention and identify further research needs. 
 METHODS: Epidemiological data on HIV and AIDS diagnoses among MSM in New Zealand were examined using information from the AIDS Epidemiology Group. A programme of regular behavioural surveillance among MSM was also designed and conducted. 
 RESULTS: Between 1996-2005, HIV diagnoses among MSM by antibody testing where HIV infection was acquired in New Zealand revealed two distinct phases: A very low period between 1997 to 2000 in which around 21 diagnoses were recorded annually; and a resurgent period from 2001 to 2005 where annual HIV diagnoses experienced a sustained rise to 66 at the end of 2005. 
 New adjusted estimates indicated that known prevalent HIV cases among MSM in New Zealand increased from 437 to 588 between 1995 and 2000 (35%), and from 588 to 965 (64%) between 2000 and 2005. This reflected diverging trends from the mid-1990s: Ongoing new HIV infections among MSM which accelerated from the year 2000; and decreased deaths from AIDS due to improved antiretroviral treatments. Unless the growing number of MSM with HIV is counterbalanced by a decrease in the rate of secondary transmission from positive individuals, it will increase the number of new HIV infections. Contrary to this, when expressed as diagnosed incidence-to-prevalence pool ratios (IPRs), the average annual rate of secondary transmission was found to be increasing over time. 
 The behavioural surveillance programme in Auckland surveyed 812 MSM in 2002, 1220 in 2004, and 1228 in 2006. An online module in 2006 additionally surveyed 2141 MSM, 647 of whom lived in Auckland. 
 There were no overall changes in HIV testing over the three offline surveys, suggesting that the increase in HIV diagnoses was not an artefact of testing patterns. There were also no widespread changes in the rate of unprotected anal sex with casual sex partners, or partners described as a "fuckbuddy" or a "boyfriend", among the overall offline samples. 
 However, the proportion of MSM recruited offline who had recently engaged in sex with a man met through the Internet increased significantly from 2002 to 2004 (from 26.6% to 44.8%). When MSM surveyed online in 2006 were examined, they exhibited riskier behaviours compared to offline-recruited respondents. For example, rates of non-condom use and sexual partner concurrency were especially high, and testing rates were lower. 
 CONCLUSION: It is likely that moderate changes involving increases in unprotected sex for some MSM, and alterations to sexual networks and sexual connectivity, have combined to push the reproductive rate of HIV beyond the new epidemic threshold set by the increase in longevity from the mid-1990s. These changes need not have been great if the reproductive rate of HIV was already situated close to the epidemic tipping point. In this case, a resurgent outbreak of HIV may even have been triggered by apparently small and subtle shifts in factors influencing HIV spread.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV infections</field><field name="subject">epidemiology</field><field name="subject">HIV-positive persons</field><field name="subject">gays</field><field name="subject">men</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090505.150029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conduct of counsel causing or contributing to a miscarriage of justice</field><field name="creator">O'Driscoll, Stephen James</field><field name="description">The Crimes Act 1961 and the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 provide that a person accused of a criminal offence in New Zealand has the right to be represented at trial by counsel. The purpose of representation by counsel is to protect the accused&#65533;s interests; ensure that the accused is able to present their defence to the Court; ensure that the accused receives a fair trial; and ensure that the accused is not the subject of a miscarriage of justice. 
 It is implicit that criminal defence counsel must be competent if they are to be effective advocates on behalf of their clients. If counsel is not competent, there is a risk that counsel&#65533;s acts or omissions may cause or contribute to a miscarriage of justice. 
 The Crimes Act 1961 allows an accused to appeal against their conviction on the basis that they have been the subject of a miscarriage of justice through the conduct of their counsel. The thesis analyses the Supreme Court decision of R v Sungsuwan that sets out the test that an appellate court must consider when deciding to allow an appeal based on the conduct of counsel. 
 The thesis examines 239 Court of Appeal decisions between 1996 and 2007 that have considered appeals from jury trials where at least one of the grounds of appeal was that defence counsel caused or contributed to a miscarriage of justice. The thesis notes the increasing trend to use "conduct of counsel" as a ground of appeal. In 1996 there were 4 appeals; in 2006 there were 43 such appeals and in 2007 there were 29 appeals. 
 During the period under review the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and specifically held that counsel&#65533;s conduct, either alone or in combination with other grounds, caused or contributed to a miscarriage of justice in 41 cases. The thesis analyses the common complaints made by an accused against trial counsel and the common areas where the Court of Appeal upheld complaints against counsel. 
 The thesis takes into account the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006 and the Lawyers and Conveyancers (Lawyer: Conduct and Client Care) Rules 2008 that came into existence on 1 August 2008. The new legislation places particular emphasis on the obligations of counsel to uphold the rule of law and to facilitate the administration of justice in New Zealand. Counsel also has an obligation to protect the interests of their clients. 
 The thesis concludes that the plethora of cases coming before the Court of Appeal, and the number of appeals allowed by the Court, demonstrate defence counsel do not always protect the interests of their clients and can cause or contribute to a miscarriage of justice. 
 The thesis makes a number of recommendations that may reduce the risk of both an accused appealing on the basis on the conduct of counsel and an appeal being allowed on the basis of the conduct of counsel. In particular, it is suggested that there should be greater degree of co-operation between the New Zealand Law Society and the Legal Services Agency to ensure the maintenance of high standards among criminal defence lawyers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">judicial error</field><field name="subject">lawyers</field><field name="subject">complaints against</field><field name="subject">malpractice</field><field name="subject">negligence</field><field name="subject">criminal law</field><field name="subject">conduct of court proceedings</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090506.091357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mental-state and emotion understanding across childhood : individual differences and relations with social competence</field><field name="creator">Martin, Natasha</field><field name="description">Mental-state and emotion understanding are important constructs for successful interpretation of behaviour and interaction with others. While false-belief understanding has been the main focus of investigations into children&#65533;s mentalising over the past 30 years, we now have tasks available that allow assessment of a broader range and more advanced set of mentalising skills amongst older age groups of typically developing young people (Baron-Cohen, Jolliffe, Mortimore, &amp; Robertson, 1997a; Baron-Cohen, O&#65533;Riordan, Stone, Jones, &amp; Plaisted, 1999; Happe&#769;, 1994). A recent trend has seen a shift away from investigating when children attain these skills towards examining individual differences in their performance. This has included consideration of both the factors that contribute to (Carlson &amp; Moses, 2001; Hughes &amp; Dunn, 1997; Meins et al., 2002; Milligan, Astington, &amp; Dack, 2007; Ruffman, Slade, &amp; Crowe, 2002), and the factors that are influenced by (Astington &amp; Jenkins, 2000; Cassidy, Werner, Rourke, Zubernis, &amp; Balaraman, 2003; Diesendruck &amp; Ben-Eliyahu, Repacholi, Slaughter, Pritchard, &amp; Gibbs, 2003) individual differences in mental-state understanding. One of the interesting questions in this area is what are the subsequent benefits or harm that individual differences in mentalising and emotion skills hold for children&#65533;s social competence? 
 The current study investigates young people&#65533;s growing socioemotional understanding and how it is related to their social abilities, both prosocial and antisocial. The aims were to provide information on the relations amongst advanced mental-state skills, to investigate how these skills were related to emotion understanding, and, further, to investigate how socioemotional skills were related to social competence. The current study also extended the literature by addressing these aims amongst older children. Two studies were conducted, involving children (4- to 7-years) seen on four occasions in a three-year longitudinal study, and adolescents (13- to 17-years) in a cross-sectional study. There were a number of key findings. Individual differences in children&#65533;s advanced mental-state understanding are relatively stable across time, and the relations which they show with emotion skills are more consistent when examining tasks that shared skill sets. Language plays an important mediating role in the relation between socioemotional skills, although this influence appears to decrease with age. Mental-state and emotion understanding are both important for children and adolescents&#65533; social competence. It seems that greater socioemotional abilities influence prosocial behaviours, and poorer socioemotional abilities influence antisocial behaviours. Overall, the current study provides evidence that socioemotional skills are overlapping but distinct constructs, that they show varied interactions in social settings, and that future investigations of how children come to understand and interact with others will be best served by careful consideration of appropriate measures and by including multiple aspects of children&#65533;s social cognition.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child psychology</field><field name="subject">child development</field><field name="subject">face perception</field><field name="subject">emotions in children</field><field name="subject">social skills in children</field><field name="subject">social skills in adolescence</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090506.104410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Culture&#65533;s influence upon service quality evaluation : a Taiwan perspective</field><field name="creator">Imrie, Brian C</field><field name="description">In order to successfully implement service internationalisation, a detailed knowledge of the target foreign culture is required (e.g., beliefs, values, lifestyles, symbols, psycholinguistics, and attitudes). This information may be used to manage the alignment of service offerings with local tastes, and create perceptual stimuli to foster trust and encourage consumption (Fugate 1996). Credible tools are therefore required to provide the market intelligence required to understand the cultural context and inform adaptation to local preferences. Service quality modelling and measurement perform such a role in reporting customer perceptions of the effectiveness of service marketing effort. However consideration of culture&#65533;s influence upon service quality evaluation has hitherto received only periphery attention within the literature. While numerous researchers have examined the role that values play as an antecedent of the service quality construct (e.g., Donthu and Yoo 1998; Furrer et al. 2000; Mattila 1999; Winsted 1997) there are no published studies adopting a more comprehensive view of culture&#65533;s role. 
 The widespread adoption of values as a proxy for understanding culture&#65533;s influence upon the service quality construct appears flawed as there is no theoretical justification to isolate values from the rest of the cultural field (Bourdieu 1990; Radcliffe-Brown 1949). Values alone, such as Hofstede (1984a) and Schwartz and Bilsky&#65533;s (1987) schemas, cannot fully explain how individual consumers reconcile their individual preferences with broader cultural influences (e.g., institutions, beliefs, regulations, and artefacts). In this study Bourdieu&#65533;s (1986) structuralist perspective of culture is utilised as a framework to explore how culture influences service quality. In this perspective the social world is viewed as being comprised of rules and systems that guide/inform an individual&#65533;s behaviour. Values are only one element of this social system. 
 In this study a case approach is adopted to map the role of culture in constructing service quality preferences. While the breadth of the research agenda means there is a large population of possible cases, Taiwan is selected as the case boundary principally due its logistical accessibility. Case selection in this study can therefore be classified as a convenience sample. However, to facilitate intensive study (Stake 2005) complexity is added to the case design through purposeful sampling (Patton 1990). In addition to seeking the perspectives of local Taiwanese outside perspectives are sought from expatriate New Zealanders and Taiwanese who have lived in New Zealand. Through purposive triangulation (Patton 1990) of both the sample underpinning the case and an interpretive multi-discipline analysis the researcher constructs a model of culture&#65533;s influence upon service quality evaluation within this case boundary. No evidence is found within either the primary data or critical literature review that Taiwanese culture has any impact upon the evaluation of service quality at the primary dimensional level (i.e., &#65533;Process/Outcome Quality&#65533;, and the &#65533;Personal Interaction Quality&#65533;). Indeed apriori modelling of the construct has similarly modelled how consumers separately evaluate interpersonal aspects from other key evaluative criteria (e.g., Dabholkar et al. 1996; Gronroos 1984). This level of the dimensional hierarchy is therefore tentatively determined to be etic (Pike 1967), subject to further cross-cultural studies. A moderate level of cultural influence was however noted amongst the second-order dimensions. Finally, the third and subsequent level indicators were widely found to display extensive cultural influence and require significant adaptation efforts for local cultural preferences.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">globalization</field><field name="subject">economic aspects</field><field name="subject">consumer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">consumers' preferences</field><field name="subject">business enterprises</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural studies</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090506.154534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biochemical and functional characterisation of proteins that regulate the floral repressor, FLC</field><field name="creator">Risk, Joanna M</field><field name="description">Successful reproduction in plants is a highly-regulated process reliant on the integration of both endogenous and external cues. Different accessions of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have been collected, including those with a winter annual or rapid-cycling flowering habit. Natural variation and mutant screens have enabled many flowering time genes to be identified. A key regulator of flowering is FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). FLC is a repressor of flowering and is regulated by a number of genes, including those in the autonomous and FRIGIDA-mediated pathways. 
 Of particular interest are FRIGIDA (FRI) and FRIGIDA-LIKE 1 (FRL1) and the autonomous pathway members, FCA and FY. FRI and FRL 1 promote FLC expression making them dominant repressors of flowering. FRI is proposed to initiate chromatin remodelling at the FLC locus leading to increased FLC expression. Once elevated, FLC levels are maintained until plants undergo an extended period of cold, therefore flowering occurs in spring. In contrast, FCA and FY promote flowering by repressing FLC expression. FCA has also been identified as a receptor of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Upon binding to FCA, ABA is proposed to disrupt/inhibit the FCA:FY interaction which results in delayed flowering. 
 To characterise the FCA:ABA interaction and identify the ABA binding site, a number of truncated FCA proteins were utilised. Initially a FCA:FY GST-pulldown was used to identify the ABA binding site. However, when ABA failed to inhibit the FCA:FY interaction a direct binding assay using [&#65533;H]-ABA was employed. Another Arabidopsis ABA receptor, G-protein coupled receptor 2 (GCR2), was used as a positive control in these binding assays. Both FCA and GCR2 failed to bind [&#65533;H]-ABA suggesting a broader issue with the binding assay. The identification of FCA and GCR2 as ABA receptors can be attributed to the quality of the protein assayed, the sensitivity of the binding assay and the subsequent data analysis. This study resulted in the retraction of the original paper (Razem et at, 2006) reporting FCA as an ABA receptor. 
 To investigate the molecular mechanism by which FRI and FRL1 act as positive regulators of FLC expresion, a biochemical approach was taken. FRI and FRL1 have no known homology to any other protein or domain and the only method for assessing protein function is through plant complementation experiments. In the absence of sequence homology, or a timely functional assay, a classical approach was taken to produce soluble protein for analysis. Truncation of predicted regions of disorder and expression, solubility and stability screens produced soluble protein of reasonable purity. This allowed characterisation of the biochemical properties of FRI and FRL1. Interaction studies between FRI and FRL1, and the zinc finger protein SUPRESSOR OF FRIGIDA 4 (SUF4), were also carried out. Polyclonal antibodies against FRI and FRL1, made during this study, were useful for protein detection in these experiments. The interaction studies, together with plant complementation experiments, suggest that the C-terminus of FRI is essential for protein function, while the N-terminus improves FRI activity. These findings provide a better understanding of how the components of the proposed "FRI-complex" may interact to promote FLC expression.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">proteins</field><field name="subject">biochemistry</field><field name="subject">flowering of plants</field><field name="subject">Arabidopsis thaliana</field><field name="subject">genetic  repressors</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090515.110026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Connecting and changing places : globalisation and tourism mobility on the Otago Peninsula, Dunedin, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Reiser, Dirk</field><field name="description">Globalisation, localisation and tourism are processes that are closely interconnected. They relate to historical mobilities and non-mobilities of humans, ideas and capital that impact on environment, economy, culture, politics and technology. Yet, these impacts on local tourism destinations are not well researched. 
 Small destinations are not researched in relation to the impact of globalisation and tourism overtime. The thesis develops an historical understanding of globalisation, localisation and tourism within the context of the Otago Peninsula in Dunedin, New Zealand. It portrays the &#65533;glocalisation&#65533; processes, the specific mix of local and global forces that shaped the Otago Peninsula and created the basis for the current conditions, especially for tourism. 
 The research on the Otago Peninsula clearly identifies different stages of mobilities to the place, generally following a similar pattern to other places in New Zealand settled in the latest phase of colonialism. The first settlers, the Polynesians, were followed by white explorers, sealers and whalers at the beginning of the 19th century who exploited a local resource that was valuable to international markets. After the over-exploitation of the resource white settlers arrived to &#65533;conquer&#65533; nature and to improve on their living conditions in a new country. They provided the basis for the following mobilities by developing or facilitating a local, national, regional and international infrastructure. Towards the end of the 19th century the major European migration had ended. The next major mobility movement was recreationists from the close urban centre of Dunedin who used the infrastructure on the Otago Peninsula at weekends, as time, money and technology limited mobilities to places further away. From the 1920s onwards, when these limitations were reduced by, for example, a better infrastructure and new technological developments such as the car and more disposable income and time, New Zealanders started to more widely discover their own country. Finally, international travellers started to arrive in the 1960s after the main obstacle, the distance and time needed to travel to New Zealand and the Otago Peninsula, was reduced by technological development, especially airplanes. During all of these phases of mobility, the Otago Peninsula became increasingly interconnected with other places on the globe, creating the conditions for tourism. 
 In this study, within the context of the phase model of mobilities, a variety of research methods were used to assess the impact of globalisation, localisation and tourism on the Otago Peninsula. These methods include literature, newspaper, local promotional materials and photographic images analysis, as well as participant observation and historical interviews. 
 The research clearly highlights the changes to the Otago Peninsula created by historical events that happened as a consequence of human mobility. Internal and external conditions at different geographical scales, ranging from the local to the global, changed the economy, the environment, culture, politics and the use of technology on the Otago Peninsula. The place was (and still is) constantly glocalised. Consequently, international tourism, as one of the more recent forces, has to be managed within this historical framework of stretched social relations, the intensification of flows, increasing global interactions and the development of global infrastructure and networks.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">internal migration</field><field name="subject">outdoor recreation</field><field name="subject">globalization</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Otago Peninsula</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090515.161047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anzac Day meanings and memories : New Zealand, Australian and Turkish perspectives on a day of commemoration in the twentieth century</field><field name="creator">Davis, George Frederick</field><field name="description">This study examines the changing perceptions of Anzac Day in New Zealand, Australia and Turkey in the twentieth century. Changing interpretations of Anzac Day reflect social and political changes in the nations over that time. 
 Anzac Day is an annual commemoration which has profound significance in the Australian and New Zealand social landscape. It has undergone significant changes of meaning since it began, and may be regarded as being an example of the changeable script of memory. The thesis argues that memory and landscape intersect to influence the way commemorative gestures are interpreted. Personal and community memories are fluid, influenced by the current historical landscape. This means that each successive Anzac Day can have different connotations. The public perception of these connotations is traced for each of New Zealand, Australia and Turkey. 
 Anzac Day reflects the forces at work in the current historical landscape. Within that landscape it has different meanings and also functions as an arena for individual and community agency. On Anzac Day there are parades and services which constitute a public theatre where communities validate military service. Individual and communal feats are held high and an ethic or myth is placed as a model within the social fabric. Anzac Day is contested and reflects tides of opinion about war and society and the role of women. It is also the locale of quiet, personal contemplation, where central family attachments to the loved and lost and the debt owed by civilian communities to the military are expressed. Generational change has redefined its meanings and functions. 
 Anzac Day was shaped in a contemporary historical landscape. It reflected multi-national perspectives within British Empire and Commonwealth countries and Turkey. For Turkey the day represented a developing friendship with former foes and was couched within Onsekiz Mart Zaferi, a celebration of the C&#807;anakkale Savas&#807;lari 1915 victory in the Dardanelles campaign. As Anzac Day evolved, Turkey, the host country for New Zealand and Australian pilgrims, became the focus of world attention on the day. Gallipoli is now universally recognised as the international shrine for Anzac Day.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anzac Day</field><field name="subject">World War 1914-1918</field><field name="subject">anniversaries</field><field name="subject">soldiers</field><field name="subject">war and society</field><field name="subject">campaigns</field><field name="subject">battlefields</field><field name="subject">Turkey</field><field name="subject">Gallipoli Peninsula</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090519.163222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The link between mental health problems and sexual risk taking in a general population sample</field><field name="creator">Ramrakha, Sandhya</field><field name="description">This thesis examined whether mental health problems and sexual risk taking were associated in a general population sample and if so, the extent and direction of this association. The thesis begins with a review of theories of risk taking; sexual risk and mental health correlates; and the existing studies linking mental health and sexual risk taking. Three empirical studies were conducted. 
 Study One produced new evidence that a range of psychiatric disorders were linked to early sex (&lt;16 years), risky sex (multiple partners and inconsistent condom use in the past year at age 21) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) by the age of 21 years. Young people who present with schizophrenia spectrum disorder were also prone to early and risky sex and STIs. Second, depression, the single most common psychiatric problem in the population, was also associated with risky sex and STIs. The risk increased with comorbid psychiatric conditions. 
 Study Two addressed the issue of directionality, specifically examining if childhood behavioural and emotional problems and early adolescent psychiatric disorder predicted later sexual risk taking and STIs. Main findings showed that childhood antisocial behaviour increased the likelihood of risky and early sex, and that low levels of childhood anxiety increased the likelihood of later risky sex and having STIs. Involvement with delinquent peers mediated the association between childhood antisocial behaviour and risky and early sex. To a lesser degree, attachment to parents mediated the association between antisocial behaviour and early sex. These factors did not mediate the association between low levels of childhood anxiety and later sexual outcomes. No associations were found between adolescent psychiatric disorder and later sexual risk taking, with the exception of conduct disorder. However, it is important to note that by excluding the group who had early sex in order to establish temporality, other behaviours of interest exhibited by this group were also excluded. 
 The third study examined whether sexual risk taking was associated with an increased risk of subsequent mental health problems, addressing the issue of directionality in the other direction. Main findings showed that reports of early sex, multiple sex partners and STIs elevated the risk of later substance dependence disorders. Importantly, this association persisted after controlling for &#65533;baseline&#65533; levels of psychiatric disorder. Early sex also predicted later conduct disorder, even after controlling for prior conduct disorder. In contrast, early sex, multiple sex partners and acquisition of STIs were unrelated to later diagnoses of anxiety or depression. The significant associations with multiple sex partners and STIs were also shown for incident cases of substance dependence. 
 Moderation analyses revealed no differences between the sexes in any of the studies except in Study Three. Specifically, the association between multiple sex partners and substance dependence appeared to be stronger for males than females for up to 10 sex partners and substantially stronger for females than for males beyond ten sex partners. 
 The final chapter in this thesis reviews the strengths and weaknesses of the studies in this thesis before considering the implications of the results for theory, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">youth</field><field name="subject">teenagers</field><field name="subject">mentally ill</field><field name="subject">sexual behavior</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">sexual behavior surveys</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090527.155127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The recognition of stop codons by the decoding release factors</field><field name="creator">Young, David James</field><field name="description">Termination of protein synthesis involves the recognition of one of three stop codons (UAG, UAA or UGA) and hydrolysis of the nascent polypeptide chain from the peptidyl-tRNA on the ribosome. Unlike sense codons, which are decoded by aminoacyl-tRNAs, stop codons are decoded by proteins known as release factors. The decoding release factors occupy the same site as aminoacyl-tRNA, interacting directly with the stop codon at the decoding centre and inducing peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis at the peptidyl transferase centre. Eubacteria have two codon-specific decoding release factors - RF1, which recognizes UAG and UAA, and RF2, which recognizes UGA and UAA. Biochemical studies identified two tripeptide 'anticodon' motifs, PXT in RF1 and SPF in RF2, which structural studies have shown occur in exposed loops (anticodon loops) on the surface of the proteins. Structures of isolated release factors show a compact 'closed' conformation whereas structures of release factors bound to the ribosome show them to be in a highly extended 'open' conformation. This suggests that a large conformational change in the release factor must take place upon or before binding to the ribosome. This transition has been invoked as a mechanism for how translational fidelity is maintained (Rawat et al, 2003), however, small angle X-ray scattering data from E. coli RF1 suggest the decoding release factors are also in the open conformation in solution challenging this mechanism. 
 Mora et al. (2003a) presented evidence that swapping the anticodon loop of RF2 with that of RF1 switched the stop codon specificity of the release factor. Recent structures of the decoding release factors bound to the ribosome showed that there was a second structural element of the release factor, the tip of helix &#945;5, involved in recognition of the first base of the stop codon. The objectives of this thesis were to investigate both the anticodon loop and the helix &#945;5 region for their roles in stop codon recognition, and to investigate whether there is a conformational change in the release factors on binding to the ribosome. 
 The anticodon loop was investigated using chimeras of E. coli RF1/RF2 and E. coli RF1/C. elegans mitochondrial RF1 (MRF1) within the anticodon loop. An RF1 variant containing the RF2-specific SPF tripeptide motif did not switch stop codon specificity showing that the tripeptide motifs are not sufficient determinants for the codon specificity of RF1 and RF2 as was originally proposed. Surprisingly repeating the complete swap of the RF1 anticodon loop to that of RF2 did not switch the stop codon specificity as claimed in Mora et al. (2003a). The studies in this thesis identified additional regions of the anticodon loop of the release factor that are important for stop codon recognition. Two of the RF1/RF2 anticodon loop variants produced showed altered codon specificity recognizing all three standard stop codons and the sense codon UGG. These variants provided unexpected insights into the mechanism of stop codon recognition and can explain why there are two release factors in eubacteria. 
 The C. elegans MRF1 contains a novel anticodon loop that is shorter and lacks the classical PXT motif. E. coli RF1/C. elegans MRF1 chimeras showed that this anticodon loop could function in E. coli RF1 and maintain the same codon specificity. While size and sequence within the loop together are important for recognition clearly there is more than one way RF1-type release factors can recognize the UAG and UAA stop codons. 
 Vertebrate mitochondria use four stop codons, two of the standard stop codons, UAA and UAG, and the reassigned arginine codons AGA and AGG. Two vertebrate mitochondrial release factors have been identified, mtRF1a and mtRF1 (renamed here mRF1[Canonical] and mRF1[Noncanonical]). Bioinformatic studies showed mRF1[C] had similar helix &#945;5 and anticodon loop regions to classical RF1s. mRF1[NC] had different helix &#945;5 and anticodon loop regions and was hypothesized to recognize the non-standard stop codons AGA and AGG. E. coli RF1/Human mRF1[NC] chimeras were constructed that showed that the helix &#945;5 and anticodon loop regions are important for stop codon recognition. Nevertheless the chimeras showed poor activity at the AGA and AGG stop codons on E. coli 70S ribosomes suggesting that mRF1[NC] has evolved to function exclusively on 55S mitoribosomes. 
 A release factor variant of RF2 was designed that had the potential to trap this E. coli factor in the closed conformation in solution by disulphide bond formation. The RF2 double cysteine variant was successfully expressed and purified. The disulphide bond between the two cysteines was detected directly by mass spectrometry in a high proportion of molecules, showing the closed form of RF2 exists in solution. The RF2 closed form variant was shown to have release activity concomitant with the proportion of the open form in the RF preparation showing that the conformational change is required for normal release factor function. Preliminary binding studies have suggested that the RF2 closed form variant can bind to the ribosome. The ability of the closed form of RF2 to bind to the ribosome allowed a mechanism of translational fidelity to be proposed from the studies in this thesis; the release factor would recognize the stop codon in the decoding centre and, if cognate, the conformational change would occur allowing peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RNA-protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Escherichia coli</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090603.104834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of molecular interactions with molecularly imprinted polymers</field><field name="creator">Myint, Mo Aung</field><field name="description">Currently, very little information is available for an in-depth understanding of the molecular binding interactions with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). To address this issue MIPs that have high binding affinities for their template compounds were made so that the nature of these interactions could be elucidated using spectroscopic techniques. 
 12 functional MIPs were prepared using a series of azobenzene and anthracenyl derivatives as the templates. Affinities of these MIPs for the corresponding templates and analogues were determined by performing batch and competitive binding tests. It was found that extensively conjugated compounds that contain at least two OH groups, an electron-withdrawing substituent and have limited conformational freedom were effective templates. 
 The most efficient MIP, M34, was prepared with 4-[(4-nitrophenyl)azo]-1,2-benzenediol (12). M34 exhibited high affinities for azobenzene derivatives of catechol, and bound those that did not contain non electron-withdrawing substituents more specifically. M34 did not lose affinity for 12 in the presence of analogues, and vice versa, in competitive binding tests. These observations suggested a distribution of different binding sites on M34. 
 M34 bound substrates rapidly, which was attributed to its highly porous polymer matrix giving ready access to binding sites. Formation of the porous matrix was facilitated by the use of DMF as the porogen in the preparation of M34. DMF is not a conventional choice of porogen because use of such highly polar H-bonding solvents is thought to disrupt complexation between template and polymer precursors, which is required for the formation of binding sites. 
 Significant changes in the wavenumbers and the intensities of absorption bands assigned to the catechol substructure of 12 were observed in the FT-Raman spectra of 12 bound to M34. These findings suggested that the catechol substructure was responsible for interactions of 12 with M34 that are critical to rebinding and imprinting. 
 In-situ analyses of dithranol (8) being removed from and bound to its MIP, M23, were performed using ATR-IR spectroscopy. Only one band, assigned to the aromatic substructure of 8, was not obstructed by solvent bands in the spectra of unwashed M23 and washed M23 that was treated with the rebinding solution. The wavenumbers of the corresponding bands in the two spectra were significantly different. This observation suggested that there were differences in the vibrational characteristics of 8 bound to M23 under the two conditions. 
 Evidence was found for H-bonding between OH groups of 8 and C=O group of methacrylic acid using transmission FT-IR spectroscopy. However, no evidence was found that showed significant interactions between 12 and 2-vinylpyridine. Methacrylic acid and 2-vinylpyridine were used as the functional monomers in the preparations of M23 and M34. The FT-IR spectra of mixtures of 12 and 4-vinylpyridine showed three new bands assigned to H-bonded OH stretches. These observations indicated that 4-vinylpyridine H-bonds with 12, and would be a more effective functional monomer than 2-vinylpyridine in the preparation of the MIPs for 12. 
 Titration of 12 with 2-vinylpyridine was analysed by &#65533;H NMR spectroscopy. Only small changes to the signals of the corresponding compounds were observed. This lack of change was attributed to the use of d&#8327;DMF, which would compete against 2-vinylpyridine for H-bonding interactions. 
 The findings made using ATR-IR spectroscopy and FT-Raman were novel because previously reported data on bound templates obtained using the corresponding techniques did not show changes in the vibrational characteristics of templates as they bind to MIPs. This investigation has shown that rebinding and spectroscopic studies can provide information about the nature of the binding interactions in MIPs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">molecular imprinting</field><field name="subject">chemical templates</field><field name="subject">spectrum analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090617.131516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Misclassification of the dependent variable in binary choice models</field><field name="creator">Gu, Yuanyuan, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Survey data are often subject to a number of measurement errors. The measurement error associated with a multinomial variable is called a misclassification error. In this dissertation we study such errors when the outcome is binary. It is known that ignoring such misclassification errors may affect the parameter estimates, see for example Hausman, Abrevaya and Scott-Morton (1998). However, previous studies showed that robust estimation of the parameters is achievable if we take misclassification into account. There are many attempts to do so in the literature and the major problem in implementing them is to avoid poor or fragile identifiability of the misclassification probabilities. Generally we restrict these parameters by imposing prior information on them. Such prior constraints on the parameters are simple to impose within a Bayesian framework. Hence we consider a Bayesian logistic regression model that takes into account the misclassification of the dependent variable. A very convenient way to implement such a Bayesian analysis is to estimate the hierarchical model using the WinBUGS software package developed by the MRC biostatistics group, Institute of Public Health, at Cambridge University. WinGUGS allows us to estimate the posterior  distributions of all the parameters using relatively little programming and once the program is written it is trivial to change the link function, for example from logit to probit. If we wish to have more control over the sampling scheme or to deal with more complex models, then we propose a data augmentation approach using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm within a Gibbs sampling framework. The sampling scheme can be made more efficient by using a one-step Newton-Raphson algorithm to form the Metropolis-Hastings proposal. Results from empirically analyzing real data and from the simulation studies suggest that if suitable priors are specified for the misclassification parameters and the regression parameters, then logistic regression allowing for misclassification results in better estimators than the estimators that do not take misclassification into account.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Error analysis (Mathematics)</field><field name="subject">Bayesian statistical decision theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An astrobiology-focused analysis of Microbial Mat communities from Hamelin Pool, Shark Bay, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Allen, Michelle Ann, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A unique opportunity to study both benthic microbial mats and modern stromatolites from a common niche is presented by the hypersaline environment of Hamelin Pool, Shark Bay, Australia. However, prior to this study, the microbial mat communities have not been well characterised. To investigate the taxonomic and functional diversity of Hamelin Pool pustular and smooth mats, and their similarity to Hamelin Pool stromatolites, culturing, culture-independent, and lipid analysis methods were employed. The cultured isolates obtained included heterotrophic bacteria similar to those obtained from other hypersaline environments, and 19 strains of cyanobacteria including potentially novel species. For the first time archaeal isolates were obtained from the pustular and smooth mats, and further characterisation of two strains indicated they might represent novel species of the genus Haloferax. Total DNA was extracted from the mats and 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were generated targeting the bacteria, cyanobacteria, archaea and eukarya. Both the pustular and smooth mat bacterial clone libraries were highly diverse, with 11 bacterial divisions represented, and Chao1 estimates of total species richness indicating ~3000 ??? 6000 species. Cyanobacterial and archaeal clone libraries revealed unique phylotypes associated with sediments of differing morphology. Statistically significant differences between the mat populations and Hamelin Pool stromatolite communities were identified using !-LIBSHUFF, a program designed to compare two 16S rRNA gene libraries. Signature lipid biomarkers were assessed for the pustular and smooth mats and an intertidal stromatolite from Hamelin Pool. Fatty acids (as methyl esters), wax esters, hydrocarbons, ether-bound lipids, hopanoids and sterols indicated the presence of oxygenic phototrophs, anoxygenic phototrophs, sulfate-reducing bacteria, sulfur-oxidising bacteria, heterotrophic bacteria and archaea in each of the sediment types. Limited contributions from diatoms, bivalves and their dinoflagellate symbionts, and from higher plant aerosols were also detected. Significantly, 2-methyl hopanoids and eight pseudohomologous series of branched alkanes with quaternary carbon centers were identified in the mats and stromatolites. Although differing in lithification status and precise microbial composition, the pustular and smooth mats are excellent analogues for the extant stromatolites of Hamelin Pool, and by corollary, provide a fascinating link to Precambrian microbial communities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shark Bay (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Microorganisms</field><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural studies of giardial arginine deiminase</field><field name="creator">Suharto, Adrian Rinaldi, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Recombinant giardial arginine deiminase (rADI) was characterized. The enzyme was found to have a specific activity of 12 U (mg protein)-1under at pH 7.4 and 1 mM arginine.  The maximum velocity was 14.75 U (mg protein-1) and the KM was 0.167 mM. The specific activity and maximum velocity values are significantly lower than the values reported previously for giardial  rADI, while the KM value is quite similar. The optimum pH for the giardial rADI was 6-9, a broad range compared to other arginine deiminases. Recombinant ADI is very specific in its binding specificity, with canavanine (KI 2.4 mM) and ornithine (KI 2.1 mM) being the only substrate analogues giving significant inhibition from the wide variety of analogues tested.  None of the analogues could be shown to act as alternative substrates. The contribution of conserved, catalytic and C-terminal residues proposed by previous research towards ADI activity was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations of catalytic site residues Asp175, Glu226, His280 and Cys424 decreased the rADI activity to below 2%. Conservative mutations showed significant activity for Asp175 to Glu175 (DE175) and Glu226 to Asp226 (ED226). Site directed mutagenesis on the conserved non-catalytic site Leu46 showed activities below 15%, with the highest activity observed for the mutation to Val46 (LV46), which differs in one CH2 to Leu46 on its side chain. The KM of the mutant LV46 was 3.64 mM while for LA46 (Leu to Ala mutation) was 1.33 mM. Excising 5, 13, 16 amino acids from the C-terminal residues resulted in activity decreasing to 0.8% of the wild type, while excising 54 amino acids caused the rADI to be insoluble. Sequence alignment of Giardia and Dictyostelium suggests a homologous area within the C-terminal extension. Site directed mutagenesis on the Tyr567 residue in this region resulted in a decrease in activity, with the highest activity observed for a Tyr to Phe mutation. Studies using specific cysteine protease inhibitors demonstrated partial protection against proteolysis of ADI against giardial proteases. Degradation of ADI by giardial proteases was more rapid at pH 6 than at pH 7.4.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enzyme inhibitors</field><field name="subject">Enzyme kinetics</field><field name="subject">Giardia lamblia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in multicyclic chemistry</field><field name="creator">Al Djaidi, Djamal Sholeh, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">* A series of investigations has been carried out on multicyclic organic systems. The Ritter Reaction was used to obtain bridged imines containing an azacyclohexene functionality. The crystal structure of the benzene inclusion compound of one of these was determined, and also that of another spontaneously oxidised example. The reactivity of these bridged imines was then investigated using mercaptoacetic acid, and also dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD). The three bridged imines studied were found to react with DMAD in totally different ways and produced most unusual products whose structures were proved using X-ray crystallography. Mechanistic explanations are provided for the formation of these novel and totally unexpected products. * 6-Methylidene-3,3,7,7-tetramethylbicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-one was reacted with acetonitrile and sulfuric acid to deliberately combine molecular rearrangement with Ritter Reaction chemistry. Five different products were obtained and the pathway of formation of these products was uncovered. The structures of three of these rearranged substances were confirmed by X-ray methods. * The rare tricyclo[5.3.1.1 3,9]dodecane ring system is known to contain severe skeletal distortions due to the nature of its skeleton. These properties were investigated by means of X-ray determinations at two temperatures. It was found that although the bond lengths were little affected, several of the bond angles were highly anomalous. These had angles far from the ideal tetrahedral value and, in some cases, were close to planar (120 degrees). The molecular motion of the skeleton was also investigated using variable temperature NMR measurements and energy values for the twisting motion involved were determined. * Schroeter and Vossen's Red Salt, first discovered in 1910, was investigated in detail by NMR and X-ray spectroscopy. The detailed structure of this most unusual compound was determined for the first time. * The Red Salt is based on the bicyclo[3.3.0]octane ring system and can be converted into several synthetically useful derivatives, including a tetraester and the 3,7-diketone. The former was shown to exist completely in the enolised tautomeric form (like Meerwein's Ester), and the latter was used as a synthetic entry for making diquinoline substituted analogues of interest in host-guest chemistry.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry, Organic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainability and participation in the governing of water use: the case of water recycling</field><field name="creator">Stenekes, Nyree, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Urban water recycling has been promoted as one of several ways that water use efficiency could be improved in Australia???s cities, but few such schemes have been introduced. Many urban water-recycling schemes have been proposed, but often, these projects have been rejected because of community opposition. These difficulties suggest that recycling water is not just about having the right answer to any problem, but about the way in which the question is addressed. It is concerned with how practice is institutionalised; not just the rule making, but also the understandings and values that make the rule-making possible. In this thesis, the question of how the system of water governance could be strengthened to encourage sustainable water use through water recycling is examined. An analysis of experiences in three Australian case studies is conducted, in which recycled water was proposed for sustainability, to illuminate the way in which water use is institutionalised. Particular attention is given to the construction of meaning in relation to water use, by considering how water problems are framed and negotiated by different stakeholders and groups and the significance of the multiplicity of interpretive frameworks in use for the institutionalisation of practice. The analysis draws on institutional organisational theory and interpretive methods, which regard interpretation as one element (cognitive) in the stabilisation of social practice and closely linked to organisation (regulative) and values (normative). The study findings suggest meaning was a very important part of institutional change. Participants tended to construct policy issues as they became involved by drawing on different interpretive frameworks embodying different values and expectations. These interpretations reflected the organisational structuring of practice, such that the position/role in the organisational field reflected an actor???s interpretation of problems and/or solutions. Outcomes of the study suggest that institutionalising change in water management is problematic and depends on changes in the regulative, normative and cognitive dimensions of practice, as part of a continuous feedback loop between interpretation and practice. This view of change contrasts with existing research, which tends to see the problem in terms of influencing attitudes of specific groups and assumes preferences precede the action.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Water reuse</field><field name="subject">Recycling (Waste, etc.)</field><field name="subject">Water resources development</field><field name="subject">Sustainable development</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A way forward: an indicator system for eco-industrial parks in China</field><field name="creator">Ou, Yuning, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">Under the background of worldwide transition towards sustainability, Chinese government has begun to advocate nationwide sustainable-industrialization through initiating Eco-industrial Parks (EIPs) since last decade. While EIP projects are widely carried out by both central and local governments, the standards for EIP planning and management promulgated in China are considered to be inefficient and incomprehensive in this study. Due to the challenge of economy-environment conflict China confronts and the consequent narrow definition of China's EIPs which focuses mainly on environmental performance, a main limitation of the standards is the unbalanced considerations between the three basic foundations of sustainable development (SD) concept - economic growth, social development, and environmental protection and restoration.  By reviewing several leading assessment tools being used internationally, as well as analyzing the specific issues existing during industrial development in China, this research intends to develop a synthetic and advanced indicator system, to evaluate China&#146;s EIP performance. This system comprises 34 indicators that integrate four broad aspects of 'economic development', 'social development', 'environmental management', and 'administration'. For each indicator, detailed measurement and criterion are proposed for evaluation and implementation. Additionally, a case study of Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area (TEDA), a certificated EIP, is conducted to illustrate the application of this assessment system.  The proposed indicator system is supposed to fill in the gap in EIP performance evaluation in China, from a view of the internationally perceived understandings of EIP and SD concepts. Although future studies are still needed to test and improve its feasibility and accuracy in terms of both indicator selection and criteria setting, this system provides a generic framework for EIP assessment work in China and is expected to drive China's EIP movement towards a more sustainable approach.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Eco-industrial Park</field><field name="subject">Indicator system</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43592</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prediction of Change in Quality of 'Cripps Pink' Apples during Storage</field><field name="creator">Pham, Van Tan</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Modelling and simulation of apple firmness and stiffness</field><field name="subject">Prediction of changes in firmness and stiffness of 'Cripps Pink' apples during storage</field><field name="subject">Changes in quality of 'Cripps Pink' apples during storage</field><field name="subject">Change in colour of 'Cripps Pink' apples</field><field name="subject">Ethylene production of 'Cripps Pink' apples</field><field name="subject">Respiration of "Cripps Pink' apples</field><field name="subject">Normal atmosphere (NA) storage</field><field name="subject">Controlled atmosphere (CA) storage</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bringing women from the margin to the mainstream of rice research and technology development : strategies and lessons learned</field><field name="creator">Paris, Thelma Romero</field><field name="description">This study discusses the strategies and lessons learned by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in targeting rice research toward poor women.The strategies include socio-economic research on gender issues;technology development for women-specific tasks through participatory research; collaborative research with national agricultural research systems (NARS) and networks; research-oriented training on gender analysis; organization of conferences and workshops on gender issues; recognition of female rice scientists; gender audit of research projects and appointment of a social scientist to coordinate gender-related activities.A revised conceptual framework of farming systems research and gender analysis was used to better understand the complex interrelationship between the environment (physical, socio-economic, cultural), and intra-household dynamics, particularly men and women's roles and responsibilities in rice-based farming systems.Case studies were conducted in the Philippines and eastern India.Improved seed management and adoption of improved glutinous rice varieties showed potential for increasing yields and income.Women's narratives were interwoven within the quantitative analysis to make their voices heard in the story.The most important lesson learned from the author's experience is that targeting research toward poor rural women can be an effective strategy in providing them with choices, opportunities and abilities to enhance their role as food producers.

This international trend toward increased co-ownership has been manifested in cross border collaborations and, with this sharing of risks has come the dilemma of preserving the operational integrity of these assets and the capital value of the fractional interests created. This thesis considers the process of valuation of fractional interests, examining the methods employed in both the real estate and securities investment communities, and it identifies the shortcomings of the current unstructured approach to the problem. It reveals the impact of improperly structured agreements between co-owners on the value of their interests and illustrates the enormity of this in terms of the Australian publicly traded real estate securities sector. This thesis concludes that the current deficiencies in fractional interest valuation methodologies can be effectively addressed through the adoption, by professional real estate valuers, of a common approach to the investigation of the factors influencing the value of fractional interests and the terms of agreements which underlie these interests</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">real estate investment</field><field name="subject">syndication, joint ventures</field><field name="subject">risk management</field><field name="subject">portfolio management</field><field name="subject">investment analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creativity and embodied learning</field><field name="creator">Wright, David</field><field name="description">This thesis looks at the way in which drama education constructs opportunities for learning. Constructivism and self-organising systems theory are used to further understand how individuals and societies construct their own learning. Important in this process is the self-conscious experience of the learner. The notion of being &#8216;in learning&#8217; rather than outside of and observing the learning is central. This consciousness facilitates the creation of meaning, which plays a role in determining the manner in which further participation in learning occurs, hence further learning. This emphasises the process of learning over the product of learning. The function that language and emotion serve in this process also deserves consideration. This perspective upon process has a considerable impact upon the way in which learners make meaning and the way in which they approach learning. Questions surrounding a consciousness of participation bring the senses, the feelings, the emotions and other physical experience to the fore. They require that the learning of the body be experienced. Embodied learning is insufficiently acknowledged and theorised in drama education. Through bringing together constructivism, systems theory, drama education and contemporary performance theory this thesis argues for a greater recognition of the relationship between the body and learning.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psychology of learning</field><field name="subject">creative writing</field><field name="subject">creative ability in children</field><field name="subject">radical constructivism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Limit states design of steel formwork shores</field><field name="creator">Ferguson, Steve</field><field name="description">Approximately half of all framework collapses occur during concrete placement.

The findings have important implications for the provision of programs and techniques employed to address students' problems following the transition to adolescence and secondary school.

As a corollary, cultural interdependence between professional identities may have profound consequences for health reform and for hospital management. By exploring the two main ideas, Professional Sub-group culture and change, this research draws from existing theory in areas such as organisational culture and cultural change, professional identities and health reform. The thesis addresses three anthropological perspectives of cultural change. It addresses the integration perspective as a homogenous unity by analysing the organisation-wide key ideas (or myths) that make action possible, often espoused by senior management. It addresses the fragmentation perspective as a gathering of transient concerns, by acknowledging the ambiguity and anxiety associated with a state of constant flux. It analyses the differentiation perspective as a collection of subcultures and its commonalities and differences. The change discussed in the thesis was not of an archetypal nature. There was no transformation of the organisational business model at government level. However, at lower levels, actors in the organisation experienced jolts through decreed change from a small district level hospital to a large tertiary level trauma centre. This research re-evaluates the theory on professional identity by establishing to what extent environmental changes and organisational changes impact upon professional identity from three cultural perspectives. This research does this by first assessing the health care organisation for existence of occupational subcultures through survey. The research continues by investigating the relationships between occupational groups through focus group discussion and in-depth interviews. Participant observation is used to illustrate and reflect commonality and diversity.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have the largest hydrogen storage capacity among the hydrogen storage materials known at present. The Ni-MH battery can be used to store and then discharge large amounts of hydrogen reversibly by using hydrogen storage materials as negative electrode.  The electrochemical hydrogen storage performances of metal hydride electrodes with different levels of multi wall carbon nanotubes (20%, 15%, 10%, 5% and 2% of Ni-MH battery's active materials) has been investigated under similar charge-discharge conditions. Electrochemical test cell consisted of a single hydrogen storage negative electrode sandwiched between two NiOOH/Ni(OH)2 positive electrodes. A 6M aqueous KOH solution was used as electrolyte. Electrochemical properties such as specific discharge capacity, high rate charge-discharge capability and cycle life stability have been investigated. The morphology and structure of negative electrode material were examined by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. Chemical analysis of the hydrogen storage alloy was performed using electron probe microanalysis, electron diffraction spectroscopy and induced coupled plasma spectroscopy analysis. Hydrogen absorption-desorption properties were measured in terms of pressure-composition-isotherm curves. It has been found in this study that the presences of CNTs significantly enhanced the overall electrochemical properties of the Ni-MH battery. Maximum specific discharge capacity was observed for 5% CNTs electrode reaching 243 mAh/g, whereas 0% CNTs could only reach 229 mAh/g. High rate charge and discharge capabilities of 5% CNTs electrodes were ~ 241% and 250% higher than the corresponding values for 0% CNTs electrode. Furthermore, the differences in electrochemical hydrogen storage of CNTs with different diameters of 10-20 nm, 20-40 nm, 40-60 nm, and 60-100 nm were investigated. Electrochemical results demonstrated that CNTs with different diameters showed a large variation in the electrochemical hydrogen storage capability under the similar experimental condition. A comparison between electrodes with different CNTs studies was carried out in order to optimize nanotubes choices for Ni-MH battery. It was found that smaller tube diameters, 20-40 nm and 5% CNTs negative electrode showed the best electrochemical properties of Ni-MH battery system.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrodes, Carbon</field><field name="subject">Nanotubes</field><field name="subject">Electrochemistry</field><field name="subject">Electric batteries</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26174</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topic-focused and summarized web information retrieval</field><field name="creator">Yoo, Seung Yeol, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since the Web is getting bigger and bigger with a rapidly increasing number of heterogeneous Web pages, Web users often suffer from two problems:  P1) irrelevant information and  P2) information overload  Irrelevant information indicates the weak relevance between the retrieved information and a user's information need. Information overload indicates that the retrieved information may contain 1) redundant information (e.g., common information between two retrieved Web pages) or 2) too much amount of information which cannot be easily understood by a user.  We consider four major causes of those two problems P1) and P2) as follows;  ??? Firstly, ambiguous query-terms.  ??? Secondly, ambiguous terms in a Web page.  ??? Thirdly, a query and a Web page cannot be semantically matched, because of the first and second causes.  ??? Fourthly, the whole content of a Web page is a coarse context-boundary to measure the similarity between the Web page and a query.  To answer those two problems P1) and P2), we consider that the meanings of words in a Web page and a query are primitive hints for understanding the related semantics of the Web page. Thus, in this dissertation, we developed three cooperative technologies: Word Sense Based Web Information Retrieval (WSBWIR), Subjective Segment Importance Model (SSIM) and Topic Focused Web Page Summarization (TFWPS).  ??? WSBWIR allows for a user to 1) describe their information needs at senselevel and 2) provides one way for users to conceptually explore information existing within Web pages.  ??? SSIM discovers a semantic structure of a Web page. A semantic structure respects not only Web page authors logical presentation structures but also a user specific topic interests on the Web pages at query time.  ??? TFWPS dynamically generates extractive summaries respecting a user's topic interests.  WSBWIR, SSIM and TFWPS technologies are implemented and experimented through several case-studies, classification and clustering tasks. Our experiments demonstrated that 1) the comparable effectiveness of exploration of Web pages using word senses, and 2) the segments partitioned by SSIM and summaries generated by TFWPS can provide more topically coherent features for classification and clustering purposes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Topic-focus</field><field name="subject">Summarization</field><field name="subject">Web Information Retrieval</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysts' forecasts and future stock return volatility: a firm-level analysis for NYSE Firms</field><field name="creator">Shan, Yaowen, School of Banking &amp; finance, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study demonstrates that financial analysts significantly affect short-term stock prices, by examining how non-accounting information particularly contained in analysts' forecasts contributes to the fluctuation of future stock returns.

It aims to analyse how audience members utilise a popular anime in Japan for their construction and reconstruction of sense of self, which is referred to as socialisation. Academic research has increasingly shed light on audience members??? socialisation by utilising mass media products in encompassing academic fields such as media studies, communication studies and cultural studies. It is widely agreed that the content of mass media products play a significant role in their socialisation. This study takes up a Japanese anime, Mononoke Hime as a sample case for investigating audience members??? socialization. Through the analysis of reactions of audience members to Mononoke Hime, it will be investigated how audience members interpret the anime reflecting one???s experience in the society relating the experience to the content of Mononoke Hime. It will be clarified that the audience members of the anime construct and reconstruct their sense of self, morals and values in the society, that is, they utilize the anime as a facility for their socialization. The data of this study are collected comments which are compiled in a published magazine and private comments posted on Internet sites. 133 comments in the magazine and 32 comments on Internet sites are selected for the analysis. The data were analysed by two analytical approaches. The first analysis is to see how the consulted viewers established their relationship with the anime, while the second analysis is to see how the viewers depicted and interpreted the content of the anime. This study concluded that the consulted audience members show high level of ideological involvement with the anime; they depict parts of the anime relating to their experience in the real life and talk the anime seriously rather than playfully enjoy it as an entertainment. By analysing the comments of consulted audience members, it is also revealed that the audience members take characters of the anime as a role model both in cross gender and gender based ways.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese language</field><field name="subject">Animated films -- Japan</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced techniques application of on-line partial discharge detection in power cables</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Hao, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Large numbers of installed medium or high voltage power cables are now of advanced age and have gradual insulation deterioration problems. On-line Partial Discharge (PD) measurement has inherent advantages over the conventional off-line measurement, but it also suffers from a very significant Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI) problem due to the small PD signal levels being monitored.   The large magnitude EMI signal often completely swamps the smaller magnitude PD signal, making it difficult to monitor anything but extremely large PD activity. To monitor cable condition and to be able to assess insulation degradation trends requires advanced techniques. In this thesis, the issues of sensor selection, digital filtering, software based on-line differential technique and wavelet Transform (WT) de-noising techniques are studied. Their applicability, advantages and limitations are discussed with the simulation and high voltage measurement results. The High Frequency Current Transformer (HFCT) type PD sensor is selected after being compared with other sensor in term of sensitivity, universal applicability, frequency response and the installation difficulty. The sinusoidal noise frequency identification and application of the conventional digital filtering are studied. The Least Mean Square (LMS) and Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithm digital adaptive filters are compared in detail and RLS adaptive filter is selected. Wavelet transform de-noising technique for on-line PD measurement is carefully studied and the applications of noise reduction are developed. A novel WT threshold value selection algorithm is presented in this thesis. The new WT algorithm is compared with the existing wavelet techniques using numerical simulation and laboratory high voltage testing data on cables. The results show that this new fully automatic WT de-noising method has achieved great progress with the capability of detection 30 pC PD signal during on-site on-line measurement where typical noise level is ten times higher in magnitude. On the basis of traditional off-line differential or balanced detection circuit, a software based on-line differential technique is proposed in this thesis. The novel method developed has the capability to process one whole AC cycle of PD data. It enables traditional q-?? and n-?? distributions to be obtained as well as PD repetition rates and the usual integrated PD parameters. These techniques are developed for the on-site on-line PD measurement in power cables, but they are not limited to cables. They can also be applied to other high voltage equipment with minor or without modification in the data acquisition procedure.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electric cables</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two essays in business forecasting and decision-making</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Carmina Caringal, Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation is two essays in business decision-making. The first essay is motivated by recent field evidence suggesting significant reliance on conventional techniques (e.g. NPV and DCF) without assessment of the decision profile - its degree of uncertainty, ambiguity and knowledge distribution. However, without knowing the decision profile, the chosen decision might not be appropriate given the decision situation. Therefore, essay 1 develops a multi-faceted conceptualization of the decision profile and provides a prescriptive model for choosing appraisal methods based on this profile. Specifically, it prescribes the limited use of conventional methods to low ambiguity and uncertainty situations and using decision trees, real options, scenario planning and case-based methods as the level of uncertainty increases. In high ambiguity situations, however, the only viable approaches are case-based methods which do not have perfect information assumption that conventional alternative methods do.  Case-based methods have been supported theoretically in case-based decisions and case-based reasoning literature but lags in its use in business decision-making. Possible reasons for this include a lack of concrete applications and developments of major concepts such as its case memory, similarity and prediction functions. Therefore, essay 2 proposes a model of case-based decisions called similarity-based forecasting (SBF) and applies it to a high uncertainty and ambiguity situation -- namely forecasting movie success. In doing so, it outlines operational definitions of the memory, similarity and prediction functions and, based on data from the entertainment industry, provides empirical support for the hypothesis that case-based methods can be more accurate than regression forecasting; both SBF and combined SBF-regression models were able to predict movie gross revenues with 40% and 50% greater accuracy than regression respectively. This essay concludes with a discussion of some possible directions for future research including applications using data from other domains and settings, testing the boundary conditions for which the SBF approach should be applied, experiments using SBF under uncertainty and complexity manipulations, and 'time stamped' comparisons with predictions made using information markets (e.g. Hollywood Stock Exchange).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business -- Decision making.</field><field name="subject">Business forecasting.</field><field name="subject">Management information systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40890</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experiential shaping of public space during pilgrimage: the Alandi-Pandharpur Palkhi</field><field name="creator">Sane, Prajakta, School of Architecture, UNSW</field><field name="description">Space perceived and experienced through movement presents an interesting array of imagery which blends together to form a comprehensive whole. My thesis explores this dimension of spatial complexity through the public ritual of pilgrimage. This profound and deeply significant human activity connects the individual places to form an integrated sacred network. The practice of pilgrimage has developed over centuries across the globe and continues to grow and influence a huge cross section of society to come together and move en-masse towards religious centres and personal enlightenment.  Public spaces demand a simultaneous co-existence of people, activities and their setting. The phenomenon of pilgrimage is central to the public realm. Its study involves an intricate layering of beliefs, customs, traditions and religion which collectively govern the people-space relationship. The transformation of a space to a place, from static to dynamic, from passive to active occurs during this activity, maintaining the traditional usage while simultaneously evolving as a product of interaction between people, rituals and spaces. In this thesis, I examine the experiential shaping of space which occurs through pilgrims' activities and their impacts on the given urban and architectural conditions.  The research is based on my study of the Alandi-Pandharpur Pilgrimage in India. It is an outcome of my participation in the ritual as, both, an architect and a pilgrim. I focus on the existing public spaces and their spontaneous response to the unplanned activity of the Pilgrimage. The spatial experience transcends the criteria of aesthetics and functionality of a public space to a deeper exploration of human characteristics and convictions. From this perspective, the thesis considers the broader role of designed public spaces, the extent of inclusion of community rituals and their significance in the shaping of built environment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pilgrims and pilgrimages.</field><field name="subject">Space (Architecture) -- Cross-cultural studies.</field><field name="subject">Space (Architecture) -- Social aspects.</field><field name="subject">Space (Architecture) -- Psychological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Space perception.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of abnormal cardiac function in murine models of hypocontractility and hypercontractility</field><field name="creator">Tan, Ju Chiat, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Heart failure has a significant impact on mortality and morbidity. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the third most common cause of heart failure and the most common reason for heart transplantation. Familial DCM is known to be caused by mutations in the LMNA gene encoding lamins A and C. New methods to enhance cardiac contractility would be beneficial in the treatment or prevention of heart failure. The focus of this thesis was to evaluate the mechanisms of altered contractility in two mouse models: the LMNA knockout model (homozygous, Lmna-/-; heterozygous, Lmna+/-) generated by targeted deletion of the lmna gene, and the model of enhanced contractility due to cardiac alpha1A-adrenergic receptor (???1A-AR) overexpression (A1A1). Previous studies have found altered nuclear-desmin connections in lamin A/C deficient mice. It was proposed that these alterations result in ???defective force transmission???, which leads to DCM. Studies in this thesis have supported this hypothesis. Studies of isolated single cardiomyocytes from mice aged 4-6 weeks demonstrated abnormal cell morphology and contractile dysfunction in Lmna-/- cardiomyocytes, while Lmna+/- cells showed no overt phenotype. Excitation-contraction coupling experiments and forcecalcium studies in skinned fibers excluded altered calcium kinetics as a primary cause of DCM in this model, but there was evidence of reduced sarcomere numbers and reduced sarcomere lengths as a contributor to reduce force generation in Lmna-/- and Lmna+/- mice.  Previous in vivo studies showed that A1A1 mice had enhanced contractility with the absence of hypertrophy. Studies on isolated single cardiomyocytes from A1A1 mice aged 8-12 weeks showed reduced contractility in the absence of ???1A-AR stimulation, but an exaggerated response to ???1A-AR stimulation. In contrast isolated isovolumic Langendorff perfused A1A1 hearts without ???1A-AR stimulation replicated the enhanced contractility observed in vivo. These studies are consistent with down-regulation of contractility due to the hyperactivity of the overexpressed ???1A-AR in vivo, which only becomes evident in isolated cells without ???1A-AR stimulation due to the loss of functional receptor numbers during isolation. Sufficient spontaneously active ???1A-ARs are preserved in the isolated Langendorff heart preparation to ensure maximum contractility driven by increase calcium release.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiography</field><field name="subject">Heart -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">Mice as laboratory animals</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28879</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multistage quadratic stochastic programming</field><field name="creator">Lau, Karen Karman, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">Multistage stochastic programming is an important tool in medium to long term planning where there are uncertainties in the data. In this thesis, we consider a special case of multistage stochastic programming in which each subprogram is a convex quadratic program. The results are also applicable if the quadratic objectives are replaced by convex piecewise quadratic functions. Convex piecewise quadratic functions have important application in financial planning problems as they can be used as very flexible risk measures. The stochastic programming problems can be used as multi-period portfolio planning problems tailored to the need of individual investors.  Using techniques from convex analysis and sensitivity analysis, we show that each subproblem of a multistage quadratic stochastic program is a polyhedral piecewise quadratic program with convex Lipschitz objective. The objective of any subproblem is differentiable with Lipschitz gradient if all its descendent problems have unique dual variables, which can be guaranteed if the linear independence constraint qualification is satisfied. Expression for arbitrary elements of the subdifferential and generalized Hessian at a point can be calculated for quadratic pieces that are active at the point.  Generalized Newton methods with linesearch are proposed for solving multistage quadratic stochastic programs. The algorithms converge globally. If the piecewise quadratic objective is differentiable and strictly convex at the solution, then convergence is also finite.  A generalized Newton algorithm is implemented in Matlab. Numerical experiments have been carried out to demonstrate its effectiveness. The algorithm is tested on random data with 3, 4 and 5 stages with a maximum of 315 scenarios. The algorithm has also been successfully applied to two sets of test data from a capacity expansion problem and a portfolio management problem. Various strategies have been implemented to improve the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. We experimented with trust region methods with different parameters, using an advanced solution from a smaller version of the original problem and sorting the stochastic right hand sides to encourage faster convergence. The numerical results show that the proposed generalized Newton method is a highly accurate and effective method for multistage quadratic stochastic programs. For problems with the same number of stages, solution times increase linearly with the number of scenarios.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quadratic programming</field><field name="subject">Stochastic programming</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32672</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The determinants of supervisory risk ratings of Australian deposit-taking institutions</field><field name="creator">Coleman, Anthony Dale Franklin, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">A key feature of best practice prudential supervision of financial institutions is the use of a risk rating system to formalise the outcome of supervisory reviews and ongoing monitoring processes. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) implemented the Probability and Impact Rating System (PAIRS) in 2002. Given the favourable economic conditions in which PAIRS was developed and has so far operated, any form of validation using backtesting methods is prevented. Consequently, this thesis seeks to develop a framework with which to evaluate and better understand the PAIRS risk rating system for authorised deposit-taking institutions. Specifically, we specify and estimate models in which the risk ratings are related to the statistical data that supervisors have access to when forming their expert judgement assessments of the PAIRS risk components. Whereas prior studies have generally focused on the overall supervisory rating, we model the primary components of the PAIRS rating (inherent risk, management and control risk, and capital support risk) as well as the aggregate risk of failure rating. Using a sample of ratings from 2002 to 2006, we find that the statistical data is able to explain much of the variability in ratings for credit unions and building societies (CUBS) and Australian and foreign subsidiary banks but not foreign bank branches. As expected, the regressions are stronger for inherent risk and capital support risk ratings than management and control risk ratings. However, supervisors?? consideration of adverse qualitative factors adds considerable explanatory power to a model based solely on statistical data, particularly for management and control risk ratings. We also model the determinants of supervisory exceptions and capital adequacy breaches over 1992 to 2006 and find that the risk indicators associated with a higher likelihood of an exception and/or breach are generally consistent with the risk indicators associated with supervisory risk ratings.  The outcomes of the thesis have a number of policy implications and practical applications. For example, the estimated models have the potential to be used as a quality and consistency tool to detect rating outliers within PAIRS. We also propose some improvements to APRA??s exception reporting system for CUBS.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">deposit-taking institutions</field><field name="subject">prudential supervision</field><field name="subject">risk ratings</field><field name="subject">Banks and banking</field><field name="subject">Risk management</field><field name="subject">Risk assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Roles of factors in simulation of parking guidance and information systems</field><field name="creator">Peng, Wendi, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Parking Guidance and Information (PGI) system is an important application of Intelligent Transport System (ITS), which has been shown to be an effect service for traffic information and parking management. The roadside Variable Message Sign (VMS) board has been the usual media for the publication of parking information in early PGI systems, and its performance over the years has been studied via simulations and questionnaire surveys. However, survey results show significant discrepancies across various traffic networks in different areas. More recently, parking information services have become available on other media such as mobile and in-vehicle devices. In contrast to VMS-based systems, PGI systems based on new media, especially the in-vehicle class of devices, have not been studied separately. This thesis aims to conduct research into the performance of PGI systems based on invehicle devices, by simulating and comparing a VMS-based PGI system with a Vehicle On-Board Device (VOBD)-based PGI system. A specially designed simulator utilising a routing algorithm known as the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol in computer networks, has been created in MATLAB. The simulation minimises the influence of specific structures of traffic networks that may be found in some networks, but not others. This is done by simulating a grid-based road network where the capacities of parking stations and their geographic distribution are randomly allocated within specific zones, and the parking demand in each run of simulations is variable load. The results of simulations, including the information reliability, reduction of travel time, demand on on-street parking and the utilisation rates of parking stations, are analysed for multiple scenarios where the compliance rate, the information update policy and the strategy of human behaviour are varied. The analyses reveal a significant advantage of VOBD-based PGI systems over VMS-based PGI systems in terms of the quality of information and the reduction of travel time. At the same time, the analyses highlight the limitations of a PGI system when the demand and supply of parking stations is not appropriately balanced.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ITS</field><field name="subject">PGI</field><field name="subject">Parking guidance and information</field><field name="subject">Intelligent transport system</field><field name="subject">VMS</field><field name="subject">Variable message sign</field><field name="subject">Vehicle on-board device</field><field name="subject">VOBD</field><field name="subject">MATLAB</field><field name="subject">AODV</field><field name="subject">Ad hoc on-demand distance vector</field><field name="subject">Simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42788</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation and function of the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRS) in rheumatoid arthritis</field><field name="creator">Huynh, Owen Anthony, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (LILRs) are a family of receptors that is broadly expressed on all leukocytes and have the ability to regulate their function. A substantial amount of evidence suggests that LILRs may be involved in immune homeostasis but also immune dysregulation. We therefore studied the role of LILRs in relation to the autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a chronic and systemic inflammatory disease involving inflammation of the joints affecting the synovial membrane, cartilage and bone. Much of the tissue damage is a result of an inappropriate immune response within the joint space caused by the unwarranted activation of leukocytes. Here were report that LILRA2 (an activating receptor) that has been previously shown to be highly expressed in the rheumatoid synovium, induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#945;, IL-1, IL-6, IFN-&#947; and IL-10 in primary monocytes. These cytokines are known to have an important role in the pathogenesis of RA indicating a pathway by which LILRA2 exacerbates RA. Co-ligation of LILRB4 (an inhibitory receptor) with LILRA2 abolishes cytokine production suggesting that LILRB4 is able to suppress the function of LILRA2. Expression of both LILRA2 and LILRB4 are regulated by inflammatory cytokines and LPS, indicative of a feedback mechanism. There is also cross-talk between LILRs and TLR4 as co-stimulation with LPS and either LILRA2 or LILRB4 inhibits cytokine production. A differential expression of LILRs has also been identified on lymphocytes of patients with RA whereby an increase of LILRA1 (activating) and LILRB1 (inhibitory) expressing circulating lymphocytes is present in RA patients when compared to healthy control subjects. From these studies, we propose that LILRs have a functional role in RA by regulating local and systemic inflammation. The presence of LILRA2 in the RA joint is detrimental since its potent ability to induce inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-&#945;, can initiate leukocyte recruitment and activation of proteases. Along with TLR4, LILRA2 and LILRB4 have the potential to moderate the innate immune system via regulation of cytokine production. Furthermore, suppression of LILRA2 function may serve as a therapeutic tool in many inflammatory diseases.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rheumatoid Arthritis</field><field name="subject">Immune Regulation</field><field name="subject">Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-like Receptors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dynamic analysis and control of a self-excited induction generator driven by a wind turbine</field><field name="creator">Seyoum, Dawit, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis covers the analysis, dynamic modelling and control of an isolated selfexcited induction generator (SEIG) driven by a variable speed wind turbine. The voltage build up process of an isolated induction generator excited by AC capacitors starts from charge in the capacitors or from a remnant magnetic field in the core. A similar voltage build up is obtained when the isolated induction generator is excited using an inverter/rectifier system with a single DC capacitor on the DC link of the converter. In this type of excitation the voltage build up starts from a small DC voltage in the DC link and is implemented using vector control. The dynamic voltage, current, power and frequency developed by the induction generator have been analysed, simulated and verified experimentally for the loaded and unloaded conditions while the speed was varied or kept constant. Results which are inaccessible in the experimental setup have been predicted using the simulation algorithm. To model the self excited induction generator accurate values of the parameters of the induction machine are required. A detailed analysis for the parameter determination of induction machines using a fast data acquisition technique and a DSP system has been investigated. A novel analysis and model of a self-excited induction generator that takes iron loss into account is presented in a simplified and understandable way. The use of the variation in magnetising inductance with voltage leads to an accurate prediction of whether or not self-excitation will occur in a SEIG for various capacitance values and speeds in both the loaded and unloaded cases. The characteristics of magnetising inductance, Lm, with respect to the rms induced stator voltage or magnetising current determines the regions of stable operation as well as the minimum generated voltage without loss of self-excitation. In the SEIG, the frequency of the generated voltage depends on the speed of the prime mover as well as the condition of the load. With the speed of the prime mover of an isolated SEIG constant, an increased load causes the magnitude of the generated voltage and frequency to decrease. This is due to a drop in the speed of the rotating magnetic field. When the speed of the prime mover drops with load then the decrease in voltage and frequency will be greater than for the case where the speed is held constant. Dynamic simulation studies shows that increasing the capacitance value can compensate for the voltage drop due to loading, but the drop in frequency can be compensated only by increasing the speed of the rotor. In vector control of the SEIG, the reference flux linkage varies according to the variation in rotor speed. The problems associated with the estimation of stator flux linkage using integration are investigated and an improved estimation of flux linkage is developed that compensates for the integration error. Analysis of the three-axes to two-axes transformation and its application in the measurement of rms current, rms voltage, active power and power factor from data obtained in only one set of measurements taken at a single instant of time is discussed. It is also shown that from measurements taken at two consecutive instants in time the frequency of the three-phase AC power supply can be evaluated. The three-axes to twoaxes transformation tool simplifies the calculation of the electrical quantities.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Turbogenerators</field><field name="subject">Wind turbines</field><field name="subject">Electric machinery</field><field name="subject">Induction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive load theory and music instruction</field><field name="creator">Owens, Paul, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cognitive load theory assumes that effective instructional design is subject to the mechanisms that underpin our cognitive architecture and that understanding is constrained by the processing capacity of a limited working memory. This thesis reports the results of six experiments that applied the principles of cognitive load theory to the investigation of instructional design in music. Across the six experiments conditions differed by modality (uni or dual) and/or the nature of presentation (integrated or adjacent; simultaneous or successive). In addition, instructional formats were comprised of either two or three sources of information (text, auditory musical excerpts, musical notation). Participants were academically able Year 7 students with some previous musical experience. Following instructional interventions, students were tested using auditory and/or written problems; in addition, subjective ratings and efficiency measures were used as indicators of mental load. Together, Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated the benefits of both dual-modal (dual-modality effect) and physically integrated formats over the same materials presented as adjacent and discrete information sources (split-attention effect), confirming the application of established cognitive load effects within the domain of music. Experiment 3 compared uni-modal formats, consisting of auditory rather than visual materials, with their dual-modal counterparts. Although some evidence for a modality effect was associated with simultaneous presentations, the uni-modal format was clearly superior when the same materials were delivered successively. Experiment 4 compared three cognitively efficient instructional formats in which either two or three information sources were  studied. There was evidence that simultaneously processing all three sources overwhelmed working memory, whereas an overlapping design that delayed the introduction of the third source facilitated understanding. Experiments 5 and 6 varied the element interactivity of either two- or three- source formats and demonstrated the negative effects of splitting attention between successively presented instructional materials. Theoretical implications extend cognitive load principles to both the domain of music and across a range of novel instructional formats; future research into auditory only formats and the modality effect is suggested. Recommendations for instructional design highlight the need to facilitate necessary interactions between mutually referring musical elements and to maintain intrinsic cognitive load within working memory capacity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music</field><field name="subject">instruction and study</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22994</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New concepts in tailgate strata behaviour and implications for support design</field><field name="creator">Tarrant, Gregory Colin, Mining, UNSW</field><field name="description">Tailgate stability within longwall coal mining is critical to longwall productivity and safety of mine personnel.   A mechanistic model was developed and tested to explain observed high deformation tailgate behaviour characterised by lateral strata movement.   Field investigations were conducted at three Australian longwall mines with an emphasis on the measurement of; horizontal strata movement about gateroads during longwall extraction, and the load/deformation characteristics of standing supports.   3D numerical modelling was used to simulate tailgate deformation, and interaction of various support types and design strategies.   The sensitivity of strata and support behaviour to; variations in roof geology, strength of sliding interfaces, depth of cover, pre-mining horizontal stress magnitude and orientation, and strength and stiffness characteristics of standing supports was modelled.   Laboratory investigations of a standing support product, the ???Can???, at reduced scale (one third) were conducted.   The tests determined the loading mechanics of the product and provided a basis for optimisation of the engineering properties (strength and stiffness).   Horizontal strata movement about longwall extraction was found to have a significant impact on strata behaviour at two of the three mines investigated.   The term ???skew roof??? was coined to describe the deformation process.   Essentially the roof strata was found to ???skew??? towards the approaching goaf.   The key geotechnical factors found to control the skew roof mechanism were; magnitude and orientation of the pre-mining horizontal stress, presence of weak interfaces along which sliding could occur, and shear strength of the interfaces.   Measurement of the nature and extent of skew roof deformation specific to each mine provided a sound engineering basis for support design.   These included; the relative roles of long tendons versus standing support, optimal pattern (position across and along the roadway) of standing supports, and appropriate strength and stiffness characteristics.   The findings were successfully implemented at Metropolitan Colliery in particular, where adequate tailgate serviceability has been achieved within a high deformation environment, and whilst maintaining a relatively small chain pillar width.   The research has achieved an alternative to empirical and trial and error tailgate support design methods.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Longwall mining</field><field name="subject">Mine roof control</field><field name="subject">Coal mines and mining</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biomolecular and cellular interactions with surfaces</field><field name="creator">Lord, Megan Susan, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The modulation of biological interactions with artificial surfaces is a vital aspect of biomaterials research. Protein adsorption is established as an early biological response to implanted materials that influences biocompatibility, hence an understanding of how to direct specific protein and cellular responses is critical for the development of future biomaterials.	  The effects of protein adsorption and subsequent cellular interactions on a variety of surfaces are investigated. Acrylic-based hydrogels are used as a model system in which to investigate both tear and serum protein adsorption from simple and complex solutions. The effect of surface topography, created by colloidal silica, on serum protein adsorption and conformation as well as cell adhesion is also investigated. Tantalum (Ta) and oxidised polystyrene (PSox) are investigated for their ability to support cell adhesion when precoated with various serum proteins. Protein interactions are examined using a combination of quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), dual polarisation interferometry (DPI) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) while cellular interactions are analysed using QCM-D, microscopy and adhesion assays. The QCM-D technique was evaluated for its ability to provide new insight into cell-surface interactions.  Most tear and serum proteins were found to adsorb onto the acrylic hydrogels, however, lysozyme was found to absorb into the hydrogel matrix and decrease the hydration, which may lead to an adverse biological response. Fibronectin adsorbed onto nanotextured colloidal silica surfaces was found to be conformationally changed compared to flat controls which is likely to correlate with the reduced endothelial cell adhesion observed on these textured surfaces.   Ta and PSox precoated with either serum or fibronectin were shown to support cell adhesion and spreading, while surfaces precoated with albumin were not. QCM-D responses varied between underlying surfaces, protein precoating, ECM deposition, cytoskeletal activity and length of exposure indicating that alterations in cell-material responses are reflected in QCM-D measurements. QCM-D parameters were found to correlate with adhered cell numbers, cell contact area and cytoskeletal activity.  The results highlight that characterisation of interfacial interactions with a wide range of analytical techniques is necessary to gain insight into cell-protein-material interactions which can then be utilised in the development of new generations of biomaterials with improved properties designed for specific applications.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cell interaction</field><field name="subject">Molecular biology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Political liberalism and political change</field><field name="creator">Field, Sandra Leonie, Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Michel Foucault???s and John Rawls??? respective contributions to political philosophy appear to have little in common.  Foucault gives an insistently descriptive account of the reality of the political domain; Rawls focusses on normative questions of how it ideally might be.  To the extent that the two thinkers are juxtaposed, such juxtaposition is generally used to highlight their differences.  Foucault???s arguments are characteristically taken to show Rawls??? preoccupation with consensus and legitimacy to be politically problematic. This thesis pursues the suspicion that there is more positive ground for comparison between Rawls and Foucault than this prima facie assessment would allow.  I claim that there are substantive and deep-seated congruences between Rawlsian and Foucaultian conceptual apparatuses.  However, to vindicate this claim I take an indirect route.  I start within the debates around Rawls??? later work.  In this way I motivate a certain reading of this work which is justified in its own right, rather than being justified by the desire to force Rawls into Foucaultian categories.  Having established this reading of Rawls with reference to immanent Rawlsian criteria, I develop the striking parallels which obtain between Rawls??? and Foucault???s historical conceptions of political normativity.  In light of this commonality, it becomes possible to understand their respective practice as intellectuals in terms of a shared strategy to privilege democracy over truth.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liberalism</field><field name="subject">Political science</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel polypyrrole-based formate biosensor</field><field name="creator">Yuan, Yong J.</field><field name="description">The concepts of electroneutrality coupling and electron-hopping, which are useful for the incorporation of functional components and transportation of electrons, were applied in this project. Discrete layered structures were fabricated by sequential electropolymerization to modulate the performances of formate biosensors. Different types of layers, with or without enzyme, were successfully grown on the electrode surface. The presence of the enzyme (formate dehydrogenase), co-factor (B-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and an electron mediator in the polypyrrole film was verified by scanning electron microscopy, chronopotentiometry, cyclic voltammetry and amperometric measurements. Monolayer, bilayer and trilayer formate biosensors were successfully fabricated for different analytical purposes. The utilisation of the biosensing membrane for the reliable batch and FIA determination of formate based on a amperometric mode of detection are explored. Electron mediators such as ferrocyanide, Prussian Blue, ferrocene and ferrocene carboxylic acid were incorporated into the polypyrrole film to lower the required applied potential for amperometric sensing and to maintain the conductivity and stability of the polypyrrole backbone. The application of artificial neural networks (ANN) to overcome the problem of reusability and reproducibilty in a nonlinear and complicated dynamic system is also considered.

As a process, recovery can been described as the lived experience of personal growth and search for meaning after the onset of mental illness. The following phenomenological inquiry seeks to understand the meaning of day-to-day activities for 13 people in recovery from mental illness. In the recovery literature there has recently been a growing interest in the everyday aspects of recovery. Routine interactions between people and the human and non-human environment have been recognised as being significant in the recovery process. Additionally, there has been a call within occupational therapy literature for research focused on exploring the experience and meaning of different forms of occupation. This study aims to address and add to these areas of interest within the current literature. Recovery narratives were collected from the participants in two phases, using an open ended conversational style of interview. The first phase focused on gathering stories that reflected the lived experience of recovery for eight participants. The recorded interviews were transcribed and analysed using the hermeneutic philosophy of Martin Heidegger. In the second phase of interviewing a further five participants shared their stories. In this round the conversations were focused on some of the dynamics of activity and recovery that had emerged as broad themes in the first phase. This allowed further depth to be added to the data and subsequent analysis. The interpretation focused on descriptions of engagement in activity during different periods of the participants&#8217; recovery journeys. It was important to dwell with the stories and allow themes of experience and meaning to emerge. Particular phrases and words were highlighted and their meaning explored if they showed something of the participants&#8217; lived experience. Through a process of writing, reflecting and re-writing the findings were refined and clarified over time. Everyday activity was found to be an important medium for change as well as a recovery outcome in itself. Findings add to existing understandings about occupation as a medium for healing and transformation within the context of recovery from mental illness. In particular, the study highlights the dynamics at play in different modes of doing and the way in which carers can influence the experience and meaning of activity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental illness</field><field name="subject">Recovery</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Heidegger</field><field name="subject">Occupation</field><field name="subject">Meaningful activity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Database training for novice end users : a design research approach : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Systems at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Blakey, Jeremy Peter</field><field name="description">Of all of the desktop software available, that for the implementation of a database is some of the most complex. With the increasing number of computer users having access to this sophisticated software, but with no obvious way to learn the rudiments of data modelling for the implementation of a database, there is a need for a simple, convenient method to improve their understanding. The research described in this thesis represents the first steps in the development of a tool to accomplish this improvement. In a preliminary study using empirical research a conceptual model was used to improve novice end users&#8217; understanding of the relational concepts of data organisation and the use of a database software package. The results showed that no conclusions could be drawn about either the artefact used or the method of evaluation. Following the lead of researchers in the fields of both education and information systems, a design research process was developed, consisting of the construction and evaluation of a training artefact. A combination of design research and a design experiment was used in the main study described in this thesis. New to research in information systems, design research is a methodology or set of analytical techniques and perspectives, and this was used to develop a process (development of an artefact) and a product (the artefact itself). The artefact, once developed, needed to be evaluated for its effectiveness, and this was done using a design experiment. The experiment involved exposing the artefact to a small group of end users in a realistic setting and defining a process for the evaluation of the artefact. The artefact was the tool that would facilitate the improvement of the understanding of data modelling, the vital precursor to the development of a database. The research was conducted among a group of novice end users who were exposed to the artefact, facilitated by an independent person. In order to assess whether there was any improvement in the novices&#8217; understanding of relational data modelling and database concepts, they then completed a post-test. Results confirmed that the artefact, trialled through one iteration, was successful in improving the understanding of these novice end users in the area of data modelling. The combination of design research and design experiment as described above gave rise to a new methodology, called experimental design research at this early juncture. The successful outcome of this research will lead to further iterations of the design research methodology, leading in turn to the further development of the artefact which will be both useful and accessible to novice users of personal computers and database software. This research has made the following original contributions. Firstly, the use of the design research methodology for the development of the artefact, which proved successful in improving novice users&#8217; understanding of relational data structures. Secondly, the novel use of a design experiment in an information systems project, which was used to evaluate the success of the artefact. And finally, the combination of the developed artefact followed by its successful evaluation using a design experiment resulted in the hybrid experimental design research methodology. The success of the implementation of the experimental design research methodology in this information systems project shows much promise for its successful application to similar projects.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer users</field><field name="subject">data modelling</field><field name="subject">training artefact</field><field name="subject">database software</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280199 Information systems not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/880</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The acquisition of the Partington Collection by Whanganui Regional Museum : valuing relationships in museum policy &amp; practice : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Museum Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, Aotearoa</field><field name="creator">Carroll, Rowan Amber</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to underline the importance of developing useful and mutually beneficial relationships between local iwi and museums, and to consider the subsequent implications for museum practice. The thesis assembles a variety of contemporary sources in order to document and construct a chronological narrative of events: minutes and communications; interviews with staff and key participants in the process of acquiring the Partington Collection by the Whanganui Regional Museum; media reports; and a survey of recent literature. The Partington Collection of Whanganui Maori photographs is integral to this examination because of its importance to both Whanganui iwi and the Whanganui Regional Museum.  The situation of colonial photography in museums has changed over the century from being viewed as a factual reflection of the cultural imperatives of indigenous peoples, to being viewed as a colonial construct consigning indigenous peoples to their past.  Because this Collection is the most comprehensive photographic documentary of Whanganui Maori from the turn of last century it adds immense value to the Museum&#8217;s existing collections.   However to Whanganui iwi the photographs of their ancestors are taonga tuku iho: far more than just photographic images they are demonstrably and undeniably imbued with the mana of their tupuna. The public auction in 2001 of the Partington Collection created a catalyst for action and an opportunity for Whanganui iwi and the Museum to work together to ensure the return of the photographs to Whanganui, an outcome that was finally achieved in 2002. The thesis concludes that the successful return of the Partington Collection to Whanganui could not have been possible without the long term evolving relationship between iwi and the Museum and in particular the more recent emergence of a bi-cameral governance structure.

This would suggest a reversal of the traditional perspective that museum practice and procedure is pre-eminent.

The clinical signs resemble rickets in other species and include decreased growth rate, thoracic lordosis and angular limb deformities. Radiographic features include physeal thickening, blurred metaphyseal trabeculae and thickened porous cortices. Computed tomography scanning of long bones reveals increased bone mineral content and cortical area, but decreased bone mineral density. Gross lesions include segmental thickening of physes, growth arrest lines, collapse of subchondral bone of the humeral head, thickened cortices and enthesophytes around distal limb joints. Microscopically there is persistence of hypertrophic chondrocytes at sites of endochondral ossification, inappropriate and excessive osteoclastic resorption, microfractures and wide, unmineralised osteoid seams lining trabeculae and filling secondary osteons. Affected sheep are persistently hypophosphataemic and hypocalcaemic. Normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentration accompanied by a two-fold elevation in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) suggested a defect in endorgan responsiveness to vitamin D as a likely mechanism, but this was not supported by in vitro studies using cultured skin fibroblasts. These studies revealed normal vitamin D receptor function and the presence of 24- hydroxylase mRNA in cells from affected sheep, even without induction by 1,25(OH)2D3. Inappropriate overexpression of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24- hydroxylase, the enzyme that breaks down active vitamin D, is therefore considered the probable cause of inherited rickets in Corriedale sheep. Such a mechanism has not previously been described as a cause of inherited rickets in humans or other animal species. Treatment of affected sheep with high oral doses of vitamin D3 weekly for 3 months showed a trend towards increased bone mineral density, thus supporting an intact vitamin D receptor. Preliminary studies on immune function revealed reduced numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes and reduced interferon-? production by lymphocytes stimulated with parasite antigen.

The approach most commonly taken previously to modelling these results has been to consider various urban water system components in great detail, but in isolation from the rest of the system. This piecewise approach is suboptimal, since it systematically fails to reveal the relative importance of the energy consumption and GHG emissions associated with each system component in the context of the entire urban water system. Hence, it was determined that a new approach to modelling the energy consumption and GHG emissions associated with urban water systems was necessary. It was further determined that the value derived from such a model would be greatly enhanced if it could also model the water consumption and wastewater generation associated with each system component, such that integrated policies could be developed, aimed at minimising water consumption, wastewater generation, energy consumption and GHG emissions concurrently. Hence, the following research question was posed:  How should the relationships between the water consumption, wastewater generation, energy consumption and GHG emissions associated with the operation of urban water systems be modelled such that the impact of various changes to the system configuration made at different spatial scales can be determined within the context of the entire system?  In this research project, life cycle assessment ideas were employed to develop such a new modelling methodology. Initially, the approach was developed at the building-scale, such that the end uses of water present in a selected building and any associated appliances could be modelled, along with the fraction of the citywide water supply and wastewater systems directly associated with providing services to that building. This vast breadth of scope was delivered by considering only the operational life cycle stage of each urban water system component, excluding both the pre- and post-operational life cycle stages of the associated infrastructure. The value of this pilot model was illustrated by several case studies, focused on residential buildings connected to the centralised water supply and wastewater systems in Melbourne, Australia. Later, the approach was extended to the city-scale by using probabilistic distributions of each input parameter, such that all of the end uses of water present in a city, and all of the associated building-scale appliances could be modelled, along with the associated complete water supply and wastewater systems. The value of this city-scale model was illustrated by applying it to model a hypothetical case study city, resembling Melbourne, Australia in many ways. Due to a lack of data, this application was limited to the residential sector of the case study city, along with the fraction of the citywide water supply and wastewater systems directly associated with providing services to that sector.  The results generated by the pilot and city-scale models showed that the new modelling methodology could be employed at a wide range of scales to assess the relative importance of each modelled urban water system component in terms of the specified results. Importantly, the high resolution of those results enabled the identification of the underlying causes of the relative importance of each urban water system component, such that efficient and effective approaches to reducing each result for each system component could be developed. Interestingly, for the specific case studies investigated, it was revealed that some commonly neglected system components were actually extremely important, such as domestic hot water services, a trend found to be largely driven by hot water consumption in showers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="subject">Energy</field><field name="subject">Climate change</field><field name="subject">Greenhouse gas emissions</field><field name="subject">Integrated urban water management</field><field name="subject">Modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/73160</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy and practice in rural primary education in Malawi: the case of mathematics teaching</field><field name="creator">Lowe, Ian Roy</field><field name="description">The research explores the practice of mathematics teaching in Malawian primary schools &#8211; such as its relevance, teacher&#8217;s mathematical knowledge, assessment practices and teaching styles in massive classes &#8211; as well as the context in which it takes place &#8211; including languages used, attitudes towards gender, ideas of the purpose of education, massive class sizes but high dropout rates.

It occurs on iron-, nickel- and cobalt-base metals in carbonaceous atmospheres at high temperature when gaseous carbon activity is higher than one. The process is particularly rapid for ferritic alloys  The aim of this project was to compare the dusting kinetics of pure iron and a 2.25Cr-1Mo alloy steel under CO-H2-H2O atmosphere at 650??C.  Polished (3??m) samples of iron and the steel were exposed to flowing CO-H2-H2O gas atmospheres at 650??C, when the gases were supersaturated with respect to graphite. The partial pressure of CO was varied between 0.25 and 0.9 atm, and the carbon activity was varied from 2.35 to 16, in order to obtain a series of experimental conditions. In most experiments, pO2 was less than 7.37E-24 atm, and no iron oxide could form. However, Cr2O3 would always have been stable. When exposed to these gases, both iron and steel developed a surface scale of Fe3C which was buried beneath a deposit of carbon, containing iron-rich nanoparticles (the dust). Examination by Scanning Electron Microscopy allowed the observation of fine and coarse carbon nanotubes, and also spiral filaments. However, the morphology of the graphitic carbon was not sensitive to pCO and aC. Moreover, the carbon deposit was gas permeable, allowing continuing gas access to the underlying metal.  At a fixed=4.5, the carburizing rate clearly increased with CO content from 0.25 to 0.68 atm. However, increasing the CO content to higher value led to decreased rates, indicating that carburizing rate reaches a maximum value at pCO=0.68 atm. When pCO was fixed at 0.25 atm and 0.68 atm, and carbon activity was varied. The induction period was extended by the formation of protective oxide layers at low values of carbon activity (aC= 2.35 and 2.55) where pO2 exceed the iron oxide formation value. For other reaction conditions, the carbon uptake rate for iron and steel did not increase with aC. The present work showed that the carbon deposition rates were not proportional to pCO or pCOpH2. Instead, the rate was affected by the partial pressure of all three reaction gases, and the carbon uptake rate for both materials could be expressed at r=k1pCOpH2+k2pCO2+k3pH22 and the rate constant k3 has a negative value, corresponding to coke gasification.  From XRD analyses, it was found that cementite was the only iron-containing phase in the dusting product. The cementite particles acted as catalysts for carbon deposition from the gas. The same deposition process at the surface of the cementite layer led to its disintegration, thereby producing the particles. This disintegration process was faster on the steel than on pure iron. Consequently, the rates of both metal wastage and coke accumulation were faster for the steel.  It is concluded that chromium and molybdenum do not stabilize the carbide but accelerate its disintegration process. It is suggested that Cr2O3 fine particles in the cementite layers provide more nucleation sites in the cementite layer on steel, explaining its more rapid dusting kinetics. However, appropriate methods of proving this assumption, such as TEM and FIB, are required.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plates, Iron and steel</field><field name="subject">Steel alloys -- Corrosion</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced laser processing and photoluminescence characterisation of high efficiency silicon solar cells</field><field name="creator">Abbott, Malcolm David, School of Photovoltaic &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Many current technologies used in solar cell fabrication have been successfully adapted from the integrated circuits industry. The success of laser processing applications in this industry indicates that such techniques should be considered to reduce manufacturing costs and to improve electrical efficiency of solar cells. This thesis examines the application of advanced laser processing to improve the electrical performance and reduce manufacturing costs of solar cells. It focuses on several different aspects of laser processing; (1) understanding and characterising the effect of laser pulses on silicon, (2) developing new fabrication technologies and (3) integrating laser processes with working solar cell devices. The thesis begins with an overview of existing solar cell structures that incorporate laser processing. A study is then presented that explores the detrimental effects of laser processing, how it can be avoided and how to characterise its influence on solar cell electrical properties. Experimental results combine Yang defect etching, photoconductance decay measurements and a new technique of photoluminescence imaging to isolate the influence of laser ablation and laser melting on silicon wafers. This understanding is used in the development of several laser processes. A laser texturing technique is developed to texture the surface of multicrystalline wafers that cannot be effectively textured with the alkaline etches used on single crystal material. Three advanced laser contacting schemes; laser micro contacts, laser defined aluminium electrodes and laser doping, are assessed as techniques to improve cell efficiency and to reduce fabrication costs. In the final chapter the integration of laser processing with solar cell devices is demonstrated through the fabrication and characterisation of n-type double-sided solar cells with laser doped contacts. Efficiencies of up to 17.4% with an open circuit voltage of 672 mV are reported. This thesis also presents the application of a new characterisation technique, based on photoluminescence, to aid in improving both new and existing fabrication technologies. The work presented in this thesis demonstrates the applicability of advanced laser processing to solar cell fabrication and shows how laser processes can be used in a variety of ways to improve the electrical performance and reduce the fabrication complexity of solar cell devices.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Solar cells</field><field name="subject">Lasers in engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the consequences for students of using different procedures to equate tests as fit to the Rasch model degenerates</field><field name="creator">Sadeghi, Rassoul, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Many large-scale national and international testing programs use the Rasch model to govern the construction of measurement scales that can be used to monitor standards of performance and monitor performance over time. A significant issue that arises in such programs is that once a decision has been made to use the model, it is not possible to reverse the decision if the data do not fit the model. There are two levels of question that result from such a situation. One of them involves the issue of misfit to the model. That is, how robust is the model to violations of fit of the data to the model? A second question emerges from the premise that the issue of fit to the model is a relative matter. That is, ultimately, it becomes the decision of users as to whether data fit the model well enough to suit the purpose of the users. Once this decision has been made, such as in the case of large-scale testing programs like the ones refocused to above, then the question reverts to one in which the focus is on the applications of the Rasch model. More specifically, in the case of this study, the intention is to examine the consequences of variability of fit to the Rasch model on the measures of student performance obtained from two different equating procedures.  Two related simulation studies have been conducted to compare the results obtained from using two different equating procedures (namely separate and concurrent equating) with the Rasch Simple Logistic model, as data-model fit gets progressively worse. The results indicate that when data-model fit ranges from good fit to average fit (MNSQ ??? 1.60), there is little or no difference between the results obtained from the different equating procedures. However, when data-model fit ranges from relatively poor fit to poor fit (MNSQ &amp;gt 1.60), the results from using different equating procedures prove less comparable. When the results of these two simulation studies are translated to a situation in Australia, for example, where different states use different equating procedures to generate a single comparable score and then these scores are used to compare performances amongst students and to predetermined standards or benchmarks, it raises significant equity issues. In essence, it means that in the latter situation, some students are deemed to be either above or below the standards purely as a consequence of the equating procedure selected. For example, students could be deemed to be above a benchmark if separate equating was used to produce the scale; yet these same students could be deemed to fall below the benchmark if concurrent equating is used. The actual consequences of this decision will vary from situation to situation. For example, if the same equating procedure was used each year to equate the data to form a single scale, then it could be argued that it does not matter if the results vary from occasion to occasion because it is consistent for the cohort of students from  year to year. However, if other states or countries, for example, use a different equating procedure and the results are compared, then there is an equity problem. The extent of the problem is dependent upon the robustness of the model to varying degrees of misfit.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology, Experimental</field><field name="subject">Psychology -- Research -- Methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Avoiding borehole failure by time-dependent stability analysis of stressed poroelastic rocks</field><field name="creator">Hodge, Martin Owen, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wellbore stability is a critical issue when drilling through tectonically stressed and complex geological conditions. Understanding wellbore stability issues before a well is drilled enables better planning of the drilling operation and helps to avoid borehole failure. This is of particular importance in underbalanced drilling where we are limited with our choice of drilling mud densities. This thesis examines the impact of fluid pressure change on wellbore stability during underbalanced drilling by using a timedependent poroelastic model. The poroelastic behaviour is analysed using numerical and analytical models. The finite element method (FEM) is used for the numerical model. Some simple techniques are developed and implemented to increase the speed and stability of the FEM solution. The common assumptions of plane strain and plane stress are explored. It is shown that the plane strain assumption results in high error while the error for plane stress is low. It is also shown that use of plane strain predicts more instability than use of plane stress and the stability difference is significant. From this it is concluded that the plane stress assumption should be used instead of the commonly used plane strain assumption. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to demonstrate the effect of several variables on wellbore stability during underbalanced drilling. These variables include mean in-situ horizontal stress, deviatoric in-situ horizontal stress, bulk compressibility and permeability. I various ways changes in these variables were shown to change the chance of shear failure, early time tensile failure through exfoliation and late time tensile failure through hydraulic fracture initiation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drilling and boring</field><field name="subject">Rock mechanics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autobiographical memory in posttraumatic stress disorder</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Kylie Anne, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This program of research investigated the nature and processes of autobiographical memory deficits in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Study 1 examined the proposition that difficulties in the retrieval of specific memories present a risk factor for posttraumatic psychopathology. A prospective study of fire-fighters found that a significant predictor of posttraumatic stress was a deficit in retrieving specific memories to positive cues before trauma. Study 2 investigated whether autobiographical retrieval deficits in PTSD can be modified by psychological treatment. Results found that as PTSD symptoms reduced following treatment, individuals with PTSD retrieved more specific memories to positive cues. Together, these results indicated that specific retrieval deficits to positive cues present a vulnerability factor for PTSD. However, this memory style appears to be receptive to modification following therapy. Study 3 investigated the association between autobiographical retrieval deficits and impaired problemsolving in PTSD. Participants with PTSD retrieved more overgeneral categoric memories and took longer to retrieve memories than non-PTSD trauma controls. This deficit was associated with impaired social problem-solving, suggesting that specific retrieval is related to successful problem solving. In an analogue design, Studies 4 and 5 investigated the proposition that resource limitations may underpin autobiographical retrieval deficits. Results generally supported the proposal that reduced cognitive resources may be a mechanism contributing to specific retrieval deficits. Studies 6 and 7 examined rumination as another possible mechanism responsible for these retrieval deficits. Study 6 found high anxious participants retrieved fewer specific memories to positive cues following rumination, compared  to distraction. Study 7 found evidence that negative rumination in the high anxious group increased categoric retrieval, whereas positive rumination had no effect. Study 8 found retrieval of trauma-related self-defining memories was strongly associated with personal goals connected to the trauma. Study 9 found that discrepancies in one???s self construct were related to the retrieval of trauma memories to positive cues.

Previously, thermal stratification was not thought prevalent in these numerous small water bodies, despite being found in small reservoirs. Thermal stratification leads to long term anoxia in the bottom waters and the release of metals and nutrients from the sediments. This can result in water quality problems such as algal blooms (including potentially toxic cyanobacteria), loss of fish habitat and deterioration of wetland habitat.  Four floodplain lakes of the Macdonald River Valley NSW were profiled and tested over 3?? years to assess to what extent, under what conditions, and with what chemical and physical effects, they thermally stratified and destratified. The morphometry, bed facies, vegetation, hydrology and local weather patterns for each lake were also investigated.  Physical and chemical analyses found elevated nutrients in all four lakes and higher concentrations of total phosphorous and total nitrogen in the bottom waters. These results were not dependant on stable thermal stratification and long-term anoxia in the bottom waters. Inflow samples had much higher concentrations of nutrients than the lake samples, so the catchment is the likely source. Samples were analysed for phytoplankton and significant populations of potentially toxic cyanobacteria were present.  Stratification depended upon whether the lake was "sheltered" from wind stirring or from incident radiation, either topographically by steep slopes surrounding the lakes, or by submerged and emergent vegetation. Aquatic vegetation limits the amount of transfer of turbulent kinetic energy from wind shear and the amount of incident radiation received. At one lake, sheltered areas reached temperatures much higher than less sheltered areas. Topographic sheltering can make a difference of up to three degrees Celsius across the lake surface. Destratification depended on wind speed, wind direction and orientation of the lake to the dominant wind direction.  An extension to the classification of fluvial lakes (from Timms 1992) is presented, with further subdivisions to describe the lakes as "sheltered" or "open" and the type of sheltering (vegetation or topography) present.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Floodplains -- New South Wales -- Macdonald River Valley.</field><field name="subject">Lakes -- Circulation.</field><field name="subject">Water -- Thermal pollution.</field><field name="subject">Geomorphology -- New South Wales -- Macdonald River Valley.</field><field name="subject">Water -- Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40581</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Instrument development and computational studies of time-of-flight mass spectrometers</field><field name="creator">Lewin, Mark James, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A computer program to simulate peak shapes from time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometers has been developed and significantly improved from a previous, unpublished version. This program can accurately simulate both TOF and orthogonal acceleration TOF mass analyser peak shapes, with contributions from initial ion properties, instrument geometry, and other factors including high voltage ripple and detector response. Grid effects have also been included, and simulations for two mass spectrometers are compared to actual recorded spectra.           The dispersive effect on ion trajectories of parallel wires and grids has been computationally studied and a model derived for each case. The model is based on the effect wire geometry has on the intrinsic focussing effect of the grid. The models for parallel wires and rectangular grids have been coded into the simulation program described above, and the effect of grids on peak shapes in TOF mass spectrometers has been studied. Good correlation between simulated and actual peak shapes for rectangular grids was obtained for grids in different rotational orientations.           A pulsed lens has been developed to reduce the velocity spread of ions in matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI) ion sources, with the aim to increase sensitivity in orthogonal acceleration TOF mass analysers. The system gave an increase in sensitivity of approximately five times over a range of masses, however instrument resolving power was reduced.           A rotating sample stage was developed for MALDI mass spectrometers which offers the potential of high sample density, high positional accuracy and repeatability, and low seek times. The system involves reading the position of a disk mounted with MALDI sample spots and timing the laser pulse to coincide with spot availability at an aperture. The system was successfully used to perform mass calibration by using a calibrant sample located on a separate spot to the analyte. Mass resolved disk imaging was also performed over a disk radius using inks.

This thesis argues that the failure of past studies to establish a positive association between corporate governance and performance might be caused by the use of conservative accounting in firms. If firms with stronger corporate governance adopt more conservative accounting procedures, then tests of the relationship between corporate governance characteristics and performance will be biased downwards. If market participants fail to recognise a link between conservative accounting and corporate governance, then firms with stronger corporate governance might also be systematically undervalued. Therefore, studying the relationship between selected corporate governance attributes and the extent of conservative accounting does more than just extend our understanding of the link between governance characteristics and accounting quality. It also provides useful insights for interpreting the existing literature on the association between corporate governance and performance.  In this thesis, detailed investigation is undertaken of the link between several governance characteristics (as well as an aggregate index) and the extent of conservatism evident in Australian firms?? financial reporting. Overall, the results provide only weak evidence that firms with certain governance characteristics report more conservatively. Evidence of any such link is restricted to measures of board composition and leadership, and even then the results are sensitive to the method used to measure the extent of conservatism in financial reporting. There is no systematic evidence of an association for measures of audit committee composition, nor board size. Finally, there is only weak evidence that use of a Big 5 auditor affects the extent of conservatism and the results are sensitive to the period investigated. These results are all robust to explicitly recognizing possible endogeneity between the extent of conservative accounting and the governance attributes examined.  Overall, the results raise important questions about the extent to which widely advocated corporate governance attributes result in accounting outcomes which accelerate the revelation of relatively poor economic news, at least for Australian firms in the years examined (1998 and 2002). However, beyond the immediate relationship examined, the results also suggest that caution is appropriate before dismissing the absence of a link between governance attributes and firm performance as being attributable to accounting conservatism.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Board of directors</field><field name="subject">Corporate governance</field><field name="subject">Conservatism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polycrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells on glass by ion-assisted deposition</field><field name="creator">Straub, Axel, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Polycrystalline silicon (pc-Si, grain size &gt; 1??m, no amorphous tissue) on glass is an interesting material for thin-film solar cells due to the low costs, the abundance and the non-toxic character of Si, and the properties of pc-Si like long-term stability and lateral conductance. Glass as supporting material significantly complicates the fabrication process as it limits the thermal budget and the maximum temperature. In this work, the feasibility of forming large-grained pc-Si thin-film solar cells on glass by ion-assisted deposition (IAD) on aluminium-induced crystallisation (AIC) seed layers (ALICIA solar cells) is investigated. IAD allows epitaxial growth at high rate, and being based on evaporation, is of low cost (high source material usage, no toxic gases involved). High-quality epitaxy on (100)-oriented Si wafer substrates is demonstrated in a non{UHV environment, to further increase its industrial appli- cability. High{rate growth and a sacrificial protective layer control contamination problems associated with the non-UHV environment. The process is then trans- ferred to AIC-seeded glass and optimised, with particular focus on the influence of the glass. Using high-temperature rapid thermal annealing and hydrogenation as post-deposition treatments, ALICIA solar cells with a 1-Sun open-circuit voltage of 420 mV are achieved. Moreover, two novel characterisation techniques are presented. One allows the fast and non-destructive assessment of the structural quality of pc-Si films using opti- cal measurements. Furthermore, `impedance analysis', a novel capacitance-voltage measurement technique based on impedance spectroscopy, is presented. It allows the reliable determination of the absorber layer doping density and the built{in potential of non-ideal p-n junction solar cells. The latter is used to investigate the influence of post{deposition treatments on the n-type absorber layer doping of ALICIA solar cells. It is found, using temperature dependent impedance analysis, that unintentional doping and defects have a strong influence on the absorber layer doping. A maximum in the short-circuit current density of ALICIA solar cells is found for phosphorus concentrations in the absorber of 1??1017 cm??3. For such ALI- CIA cells a base difusion length in the range 600 - 950nm, a short{circuit current density in the range 10 - 13.5 mA/cm2 and an energy conversion efficiency of 2.2% are obtained.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thin films</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive protocol suite for wireless sensor and ad hoc networks</field><field name="creator">Liu, Bao Hua (Michael), Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Continuing advances in wireless communications and MEMS (Micro-Electro Mechan- ical Systems) technologies have fostered the construction of a wide variety of sensor and ad hoc networks. These networks have broad applications spanning wide ar- eas, such as environmental monitoring, infrastructure maintenance, traffic manage- ment, energy management, disaster mitigation, personal medical monitoring, smart building, as well as military and defence. While these applications require high per- formance from the network, they suffer from resource constraints (such as limited battery power, processing capability, buffer space, etc.) that do not appear in tra- ditional wired networks. The inherent infrastructure-less characteristic of the sensor and ad hoc networks creates significant challenges. This dissertation addresses these challenges with two protocol designs. The main contributions of this dissertation are the design and evaluation of CS- MAC (stands for CDMA Sensor MAC), a novel multi-channel media access control (MAC) protocol for direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) wire- less sensor networks. Our protocol design uses combination of DS-CDMA and fre- quency division to reduce the channel interference and consequently improves system capacity and network throughput. We provide theoretical characterisation of the mean multiple access interference (MAI) at a given node in relation to the number of frequency channels. We show that by using only a small number of frequency chan- nels, the mean MAI can be reduced significantly. Through discrete event simulation (using UC Berkerly NS-2 simulator), we provide comparison of our proposed system to a pure DS-CDMA system as well as a contention based system. Simulation results reveal that our proposed system can achieve significant improvement in system efi ciency (measured in packet/second/channel) of a contention based system. When the same number of packets are transmitted in the network, our system consumes much less communication energy compared to the contention based system. A distributed channel allocation protocol is also proposed for the network forma- tion phase. We prove that our algorithm converges with correct channel assignments. Simulation results reveal that a much smaller number of channels is required than theoretical value when nodes are uniformly randomly deployed. The second contribution of this dissertation involves the design and evaluation of two location-aware select optimal neighbour (SON) algorithms for CSMA/CA based MAC protocol for wireless ad hoc networks. Both algorithms concentrate on the improvement of energy eficiency of the whole network through the optimisation of the number of neighbours of each node. Our algorithms not only consider radio electronic energy consumption (e.g., coding, decoding) and radio transmission energy consumption (e.g., power amplifier), but also the electronic energy consumption at those irrelevant receivers (those who are not addressed by the transmission) that are located within the transmission range. Through simulations, we show that our algorithms can achieve signi??cant energy savings compared to the standard IEEE 802.11.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">sensor networks.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical and constitutive modelling of monotonic and cyclic loading in variably saturated soils</field><field name="creator">Habte, Michael Andebrhan, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A fully coupled, effective stress based elasto-plastic model is presented for a rigorous analysis of flow and deformation in variably saturated porous media subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading. The governing equations are derived based on the effective stress concept, equations of equilibrium, and conservation equations of mass and momentum using a systematic macroscopic approach. Both elastic and elasto-plastic constitutive equations are developed. All model coefficients are identified in terms of measurable parameters. The governing equations presented are general in nature, embodying all previously presented formulations in the field. A unified bounding surface plasticity model is developed to describe the stress-strain behaviour of variably saturated soils subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading. The model is formulated incrementally within the critical state framework using the effective stress approach. The model takes into account the effects of both plastic volumetric strain and matric suction on the hardening of the bounding surface.  Cyclic behaviour is captured through a new mapping rule in which the point of stress reversal is taken as the centre of projection. The effect of particle crushing at high stresses is considered through a three-segmented critical state and isotropic compression lines. A non-associative flow rule is employed to generalise application of the model to all soils.  Solution to the governing equations is obtained numerically using the finite element approach, with the finite difference method employed for the time integration of the rate equations. The elasto-plastic constitutive equations are integrated explicitly using Euler???s forward and the modified Euler integration schemes. Yield surface correction schemes are adopted to improve accuracy of the solution. Essential elements of the proposed model are validated by comparing numerical predictions with experimental data from the literature for fully and partially saturated soils subjected to monotonic and cyclic loadings in drained, undrained, isotropic and deviatoric conditions. The results demonstrate capability of the coupled model to predict essential characteristics of variably saturated soils subjected to monotonic and cyclic loadings in a unified manner.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soils -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Soil science</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24204</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The shaping of colonial liberalism: John Fairfax and the Sydney Morning Herald, 1841-1877.</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Stuart Buchanan, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">The goal of this thesis is to examine the editorial position of the Sydney Morning Herald, Australia's oldest continually produced newspaper, as a way of examining the character of colonial liberalism. Analysis will proceed by way of close scrutiny of key issues dealt with by the Sydney Morning Herald, including: state-aid to churches; education policy; free trade; land reform; the antitransportation movement; issues surrounding political representation; and the treatment of Chinese workers. Such analysis includes an appraisal of the views of John Fairfax, proprietor from 1841 to his death in 1877, and the influences, particularly religious nonconformity, which shaped his early journalism in Britain. Another key figure in the thesis is John West, editor 1854-1873, and again his editorial stance will be related to the major political and religious movements in Britain and Australia. Part of this re-evaluation of the character of colonial liberalism in the thesis provides a critical study of the existing historiography and calls into question the widely held view that the Sydney Morning Herald was a force for conservatism. In doing so, the thesis questions some of the major assumptions of the existing historiography and, while doing justice to colonial context, attempts to contextualise colonial politics with the broader framework of mid nineteenth-century Western political thought.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sydney Morning Herald</field><field name="subject">Liberalism -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Politics and government</field><field name="subject">Sydney (N.S.W.) -- Newspapers</field><field name="subject">Australian newspapers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radiofrequency ablation in oncology</field><field name="creator">Gananadha, Sivakumar, St George, UNSW</field><field name="description">Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an established treatment option for patients with inoperable liver tumours and is now being investigated for the treatment of lung and other solid tumours. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the use RFA to decrease blood loss during liver resection, for the treatment of the liver resection edge and to investigate the safety and efficacy of brain RFA. Blood loss is an important factor affecting both the morbidity and mortality following liver resection. The use of a novel in line RF probe to ablate the transection plane prior to liver resection resulted in decreased blood loss with easier resection. This has potential in the treatment of liver tumors in cirrhotic livers and also in other vascular organs. The other important prognostic factor affecting long-term survival in patients undergoing liver resection for liver tumors is the surgical margins. Positive margins which cannot be treated with repeat resection may be treated with cryotherapy. The use of a novel probe to ablate the resection edge with RFA was found to be equally effective as cryotherapy and superior to argon beam coagulation or diathermy in an ex-vivo model. The radiofrequency ablation of the brain was found to be safe with no hemorrhage or damage to the surrounding brain parenchyma. There was no rise in intra-cranial pressure in the animals treated with RFA. The brain RFA was found to be effective and has potential for the treatment of brain tumours.  Dispersive pad site burns was a significant problem in patients treated with radiofrequency ablation for lung and liver tumours occurring in 5% of patients. Pad tissue temperature of 45oC was found to be the threshold temperature above which burns occurred. Monitoring of pad-tissue temperatures with thermocouples and application of ice packs in addition to increasing the number of pads may help decrease this complication.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oncology</field><field name="subject">Radiofrequency spectroscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance Related Musculoskeletal Disorders in Bassoon Players</field><field name="creator">Brusky, Paula</field><field name="description">PhD in Performance</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">performance related musuloskeletal disorders</field><field name="subject">musician injury</field><field name="subject">pain in bassoon players</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Change and change management in higher education in Thailand: A case study of six Rajabhat Universities in Bangkok</field><field name="creator">Sinthunava, Kittiwan</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Change management</field><field name="subject">Higher Education</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel genes associated with airway smooth muscle proliferation in asthma</field><field name="creator">Lau, Justine Yeeman</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fibulin-1</field><field name="subject">airway smooth muscle</field><field name="subject">mimecan</field><field name="subject">proliferation</field><field name="subject">asthma</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Everyday, walking and artworks</field><field name="creator">Farman, Nola</field><field name="description">The aim of this paper is to position art within the realm of the everyday for the purposes of establishing the critical/political capabilities of art practice in a post-aesthetic information-based age. In this way, art can be conceived of as a 'technology' which, having been placed in a situation/site, assumes an agency in the engagement of the subject within the dialectic tension of everyday conflict - the background in which the day to day micro-political decisions are made. I use the figure of the walker to examine the potential of a phenomenological approach to the interpretation of a theory of art and everydayness - it is the sensate nature of the walker which is valuable to the perception and interpretation of daily conflicts and dilemmas. The potential of the politically informed walking subject is to 'read' in a discriminating way the fragmented codes of complicity with which the individual/artist relates to or engages with the invisible monumentality of more powerful forces. This paper positions both art and viewer within a space which can no longer be seen as the perspectival unifying limitations of the traditional grid but as a fluid and multidimensional topology of power relations.

T.</field><field name="description">I was born in the district village of Cilimus, a little mountainous place in the residency of Cirebon. Between five and nine years old I suffered from dysentery, typhus and eye disease which could have made me die or go blind. Praise be to God I recovered under the loving care of my parents. At that time the uprising of the PKI broke out and soon after the Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI) was set up by Ir. Sukarno. From 1928 till 1932 Indonesia suffered from the Great Depression which caused much unemployment and business became very bad. At first my education was not a great success since my parents were hesitant in choosing between sending me to a Chinese school or a Dutch school. When I was successful in finishing at Dutch Primary School with good examination records I went to Solo and Yogyakarta to attend Dutch teachers&#8217; Training College and a Dutch Theological College. I had to leave school when the Japanese arrived. My family had to move to Kadugede, a remote village on the slope of Mount Ciremai, 45 km from the city of Cirebon. I could not continue my studies since all Dutch schools were closed. All the young people had to undergo military training or serve the Japanese Military by building airports and so on. I underwent Japanese Keibotai (Intelligence) military training in Linggajati, a mountainous village, 5 km from Cilimus. The Keibotai military training centre in Linggajati was headed by Mr. Watanabe who was a colonel and quite likely responsible to Colonel Kurija, chief of the Joohoobu (Intelligence Staff) of the 16th Army. Some other assistants to Watanabe were Akano, Fukuda and Tomita. The purpose of this training was to train the Chinese youth to become auxiliary Intelligence Staff. I had to flee to the military training dormitory when I was not permitted to go home in order to get engaged to my fianc&#233;e. When I came back to the military training I was punished by one week&#8217;s room arrest. One month after the arrest I heard that Japan had surrendered to the Allied Forces after suffering from atomic bombardments on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I returned home on 15 August 1945. Two days later, 17 August 1945, Sukarno and Hatta proclaimed the independence of Indonesia. Native young people underwent military training to defend their country. The republic set up the people&#8217;s Security Body (BKR) which later become the People&#8217;s security Forces (TKR), the foundation of the current Indonesian Armed Forces. Somebody was slandering me and accused me of being a spy for the Japanese military. I had an interview with the council of the BKR of Kuningan which trusted me and set me free. On 10 March 1946 my fianc&#233;e and I celebrated our wedding party. When the Dutch occupied West Java I went to Batavia (Jakarta) to find a job and asked my parents, my wife and children to come over when I settled. In Jakarta I improved my knowledge and achieved several diplomas, and degrees in Languages and Business. For many years I worked as manager and managing director of several enterprises until I ran a transportation business where I had 50% share and was appointed Managing Director. The business was running smoothly until the abortive coup of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). After the Communist coup and the rupia devaluation there came a slump in my business. I got a job at the National University as lecturer in English and Dutch. I also had private students in English, Dutch and Indonesian which became a good teaching business. But since I wanted to obtain a foreign degree, my wife and I migrated in 1983 to Australia. In this thesis I address the issue of the role of the Chinese in late colonial Indonesia. In many ways my family was typical of the Chinese as businesspeople and entrepreneurs. My attitudes to colonialism changed from enthusiastic admiration for the Dutch in my youth to a more nationalistic approach and embrace of the Indonesian Republic as a young man. While, like most Chinese, I was no supporter of Japan&#8217;s war aims, I was obliged to serve in Japanese-sponsored organisations and my analysis of the Japanese occupation is not entirely negative. This autobiographical analysis charts these important (and representative) changes in my attitudes, as well as providing a personal perspective on a crucial period in Indonesia&#8217;s history from the point of view of a representative member of a significant minority.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">politics and government</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Japanese occupation, 1942-1945</field><field name="subject">personal narratives</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/39145</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical analysis of China's equilibrium exchange rate : a co-integration approach</field><field name="creator">Su, Ting Ting</field><field name="description">The question of an equilibrium exchange rate has always been a debatable issue. Along with rapid growth of the Chinese economy over the past two decades, a number of studies have been undertaken to investigate whether or not the RMB exchange rate is at its long run &#8216;equilibrium&#8217; level. Because the equilibrium exchange rate affects the competitiveness of a country&#8217;s economy, these studies have focused on whether or not the real exchange rate is misaligned with respect to its long-run equilibrium level. One of the main reasons for this concern is that effective management of the exchange rate system could help a country&#8217;s economy achieve internal and external balance. Otherwise, it could negatively influence the stability of a country&#8217;s financial economy, possibly resulting in regional financial crises. This study estimates time varying values of the equilibrium real effective exchange rate (EREER) and associated exchange rate misalignments for China in recent years (from the first quarter of 1999 to fourth quarter of 2007). The study focuses on the reduced-form equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) model for developing countries presented by Elbadawi (1994) and follows Edwards&#8217; (1989, 1994) work on models of exchange rate determination. We identify the terms of trade, openness, government expenditure, productivity, and money supply as important explanatory variables of the RMB long-run equilibrium value. We use the Johansen-Juselius (1990) co-integration procedure to analyse our data.  Using the ERER model, our results show there is a cointegrating relationship between the real effective exchange rate and its economic fundamentals. Subsequently, compare to other previous studies discussed in Chapter 2, our restricted error-correction model suggests that the extent of the misalignment is not very large, moving in a narrow band of plus and minus 12 percent of the long-run equilibrium level during the sample period. Focusing on the RMB real exchange rate misalignment in recent years, our result shows that the RMB was undervalued by an average of 6.7 percent during the period of 2005Q:3-2007Q:4. Furthermore, our short-run empirical error correction model indicates that, on average, the real exchange rate takes over one quarter to reach its long-run equilibrium level.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">equilibrium exchange rate</field><field name="subject">real effective exchange rate</field><field name="subject">misalignment</field><field name="subject">cointegration</field><field name="subject">error-correction model</field><field name="subject">Hodrick-Prescott decomposition</field><field name="subject">RMB</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formation, durability and susceptibility : coalition traits that affected New Zealand's MMP governments of 1996-2002 : a dissertation presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Public Policy, Massey University, Albany Campus, North Shore City, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gillon, Grant Marc</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the relevant impact of three influences - policy, personality and opportunity - on New Zealand governments since 1996. The Mixed Member Proportional electoral system (MMP) was adopted by New Zealand for the 1996 general election. The various coalition government arrangements since then have been analysed using a series of case studies of identified events during coalitions&#8217; crucial pre-election, formation, duration and termination stages. The roles assumed by, or perceived of, small parties have been important as have the actions of the pivotal party in each government. My interest in this topic springs from my service as an Alliance MP. I was an Alliance party list Member of Parliament during the 45th and 46th Parliaments (1996-2002). Systems theory was relied upon as the methodology with which to study relevant political processes. Key informant interviews and participant observation were the main research methods. This research investigates the traits, apparent in the coalitions formed from 1996 until 2002, which contributed to each government&#8217;s continuation or termination. Each stage reflected the parties&#8217; competing interests as argued by theorists such as Muller and Str&#248;m. Wolfgang Muller and Kaare Str&#248;m knitted together theoretical approaches and concluded that politicians are motivated by competing goals. This seminal work provides the theoretical guideline for explaining events in New Zealand and was adopted as a framework to develop this research. Coalitions faced policy shocks, adverse polls and other critical events during the three coalition governments included in this study. Politicians adapted the formal and informal constraints. In this way, they attempted to strengthen the attributes of both the Parliaments and Cabinet to ensure that they were robust enough to withstand adverse incidents. Politicians&#8217; ambitions fluctuated between seeking office, policy objectives or electoral support depending upon the circumstances of the time. Stable and durable coalitions, as desired by the 1986 Royal Commission on the Electoral System, were those where the relevant parties&#8217; leadership enjoyed positive relationships with each other. However, parties could not be considered to be unitary actors. Intra-party relationships were important factors. Intra-party dissension contributed to inter-party conflict and vice versa. Governments that were terminated earlier than constitutionally required suffered from deteriorating intra-party and/or inter-party relationships. The crucial component identified as an important consideration for the success or otherwise of any coalition government can be summed up as that pertaining to &#8216;relationship issues&#8217; as affected by policy, personality and opportunity.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coalition government</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">MMP</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360101 New Zealand government and politics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structuring and functionalisation of titania : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Chemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ting, Yvonne PeeYee</field><field name="description">Gr&#228;tzel cells are liquid-electrolyte photoelectrochemical cells that contain dyesensitised titania electrodes. The sensitiser is typically an organic species that absorbs visible light and increases the spectral region in which Gr&#228;tzel cells may produce electricity. A key feature in the success of Gr&#228;tzel cells is the high surface area of nanostructured titania electrodes. In this study, the nanostructuring of titania has been explored by two complementary methods: templation and self-assembly. The templation of silica colloidal crystals (opals) was chosen as an inverse opal of titania would display a porous, bicontinuous structure in addition to a photonic bandgap. A diverse variety of titania inverse opals was produced, ranging from ideal &#8216;honeycomb&#8217; to non-ideal &#8216;grape-like&#8217; morphologies. However, the fragility of the material and difficulties in reproduction meant that the testing of such electrodes within Gr&#228;tzel cells was limited. Study towards the formation of a nanoparticle superlattice of titania via chemically assisted self-assembly involved the investigation of both nanostructured titania surfaces and dye adsorption. The mode of dye binding to titania and the stability of adsorbed dyes was studied to aid work toward the design of a self-assembled titania superlattice, as well as to assist in the analysis of dye performance in Gr&#228;tzel cells. Crystalline, aggregated titania and amorphous, dispersible titania was produced for dye binding studies of small organic carboxylic acid dyes. It was found that while dyes are adsorbed and intimately associated with titania, the mode of dye binding is different on a dry electrode than upon dispersed and solvated titania. The dyes appear to be bound to titania in a carboxylate form in the dry state, but in a mode that closer resembles that of the native dye upon dispersed titania.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">titania</field><field name="subject">Gr&#228;tzel cells</field><field name="subject">nanostructure</field><field name="subject">templation</field><field name="subject">self-assembly</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250100 Physical Chemistry (Incl.

Claiming the environment as sacred, however, is different from the environment in sacred sites. Sacred sites, places of heightened religious and spiritual significance, are found in all societies and visited by thousands of visitors. Visitor flows affect the environment in sacred sites in direct and indirect ways. Two distinct approaches can be identified in the discussion of impact on sacred sites: one focuses on the assessment of the physical environment and the other emphasises the effects on the cultural and sacred space. The first approach reports environmental problems such as deforestation, river pollution, and real estate development without supporting infrastructure of roads and environmental services including sewerage, water supply, and accumulation of waste, but fails to explain why these problems do not deter visitors whose numbers continue to increase. The second approach, by negating the physicality of the environment and relying on subjectivity of environmental discourses, avoids questions about environmental responsibility and management. Both these approaches do not consider how the environment in a sacred site is created.  This thesis attempts to explain how the environment in the sacred site of Vrindavan is shaped by socio-economic, religious and political processes that take place within, and outside the site. By adopting a historical-spatial analysis, it shows how the trajectory of environmental change in Vrindavan is shaped by broader patterns of changes in political economy, religious patronage, pilgrimage travel and institutional developments. It examines the changes in the iv pilgrimage landscape of Vrindavan through three phases since its establishment as a pilgrimage site in the 15th century: pre-colonial (15th-19th century), colonial (19th-mid 20th century) and post-colonial (post-1947). It details the ways in which social, economic, political and institutional developments from the precolonial and colonial past are linked to some of the contemporary problems and how these are translated into fragmented institutional responses.  The thesis examines the contemporary environment in Vrindavan in relation to the shifts in pilgrimage economy and interactions of various actors and institutions that control and manage it. It shows that the contemporary environment in Vrindavan is a poorly regulated market of religious entrepreneurs, tourism operators and real estate developers driven by the opportunities of religious tourism. The lack of institutions to regulate these activities and the inability to cater to the increased demand for environmental services contribute to the continued degradation of the religious urban space of Vrindavan. This institutional vacuum leads different actors to use contesting attitudes in absolving themselves from their responsibility towards environmental management and articulate discourses that reinforce the idea of environmental degradation in Vrindavan.  The study illustrates that claiming the sacred and making the sacred/religious environment are two different things. It argues that understanding and addressing environmental degradation in a sacred environment requires an understanding of how sacred space is produced. It shows that the environment of pilgrimage is a dynamic process shaped by the activities, forms of control, perceptions, and representations of the actors involved in the production of sacred sites. The thesis calls for a comprehensive v spatial approach to address environmental change and sustainability issues in sacred sites by integrating concerns for maintaining the religious significance of the place with the physical transformations in sacred sites.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pilgrimage</field><field name="subject">Religious tourism</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="subject">Environmental change</field><field name="subject">Sacred sites</field><field name="subject">Institutions</field><field name="subject">Spatial-historical</field><field name="subject">Lefebvre</field><field name="subject">Vrindavan</field><field name="subject">India</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/73827</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Small angle x-ray scattering as a diagnostic tool for breast cancer</field><field name="creator">Sidhu, Sabeena</field><field name="description">Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in Australian women. Current pathological analysis examines a small section of tissue for cellular and plasma abnormalities using a light microscope. However, this method of diagnosis, despite being the current gold standard, has its limitations, where human error and professional experience can influence a patient&#8217;s diagnosis. A potential alternative or adjunct to conventional histopathology for classifying tissue disease status is offered by Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS).         At the time of commencement of this work, there had been several small scale studies which examined the potential of SAXS to classify the disease status of breast tissue. These tended to focus on the supramolecular structure of collagen fibrils found in the breast, where it is known that the degradation of these fibres is related to the spread of disease. Most previous studies also used a synchrotron as an X-ray source, due to the intense and highly collimated flux available. This study used a synchrotron source, but also evaluated the use of a laboratory X-ray source, as a more convenient and relatively inexpensive alternative that could one day find application in the clinic. The work presented in this thesis analyses the largest cohort of patients and breast tissue samples studied to date using SAXS: 130 patients with 543 tissue samples. Tissues were sourced from surgical waste and classified into four groups: invasive carcinoma, benign, normal, and mammoplasty. Mammoplasty tissue samples were harvested from patients undergoing breast reduction and/or reconstruction, where no history or presence of disease was indicated. Normal tissue was sampled from patients with known disease, but pathological analysis of the tissue core diagnosed it as normal. A comprehensive analysis of the scattering patterns was carried out, analysing features arising from the collagen structure and orientation, the total scattered intensity, and adipose tissue in the breast. Features related to the axial D-spacing of the collagen fibrils within the breast tissue as well as the integrated scattering intensity (called amorphous scatter) demonstrated the highest ability to discriminate tissue types, in SAXS images acquired from both the synchrotron source and the laboratory X-ray source.         The amorphous scatter intensities obtained using a synchrotron source showed highly significant differences (p &lt; 0.01) for almost all of the tissue pair comparisons: invasive carcinoma vs. benign, invasive carcinoma vs. normal, invasive carcinoma     vs.   mammoplasty,     benign    vs.   mammoplasty,     and    normal    vs. mammoplasty. However, no significant difference was seen in the amorphous scatter between benign versus normal tissues (p = 0.30). The amorphous scatter values increased with severity of disease, i.e. it was the highest for invaded tissues and decreased progressively from benign to normal to mammoplasty. There was a significant difference between normal and mammoplasty tissue types using the amorphous scatter as a discriminator (p = 0.0025). Pathological assessment cannot differentiate between these two tissue types, which suggests that there may be changes occurring in these tissue structures at the supramolecular level that can be characterised using SAXS.         The ability of SAXS to reveal structural differences between normal and mammoplasty tissue types is highly significant, for both disease diagnosis and treatment, as well as for understanding disease progression. For example, these differences might aid in determining surgical margin clearance of excised breast lesions as well as potentially provide a means of pre-screening or perhaps improve false-negative rates of diagnosis. The potential of SAXS to reveal macroscopic extent and directional spread of disease was explored using two-dimensional mapping of the amorphous scatter. These maps showed broad agreement with histopathological diagnosis, but further investigation regarding their reliability and interpretation for clinical utility is still needed. Changes in both the amorphous scatter and the axial D- spacing were seen in tissue samples up to 6 cm away from the primary site of disease. In particular, a significant decrease in both parameters was seen between the centre of the tumour (at 0 cm) and 2 cm away, suggesting that closer examination of the tissue structures over the disease/healthy tissue border may provide information regarding the mechanisms of metastasis and growth of cancerous tumours.         The combination of the amorphous scattering results from the two X-ray sources indicates that the size of the scatterers may be the key in classifying tissue types. The synchrotron source was able to access a lower q-range (q = 0.1-0.6 nm-1) and the laboratory source covered a larger q-range (q = 0.25-2.3 nm-1). Mammoplasty tissues appear to be characterised by large scattering components (d &gt; 25.13 nm), whereas normal tissues are characterised by slightly smaller scattering components (10.47 nm &lt; d &lt; 25.13 nm) and benign tissues by even smaller scattering components (4.83 &lt; d &lt; 10.47 nm). It appears that the size of the scatterers contributing to the total scattering intensity decreases with severity of disease, which was seen independently with both X-ray sources. Further investigation is warranted to determine the biological origin of these differences. These results also suggest that the optimum SAXS instrument may need to cover a scattering vector range of q &lt; 0.25 nm-1 to identify differences in healthy tissue types, and q &gt; 2.3 nm-1 to possibly investigate invasive carcinoma tissue types. A SAXS apparatus that can examine a large q-range may provide all of the necessary information from the amorphous scatter to differentiate between tissue groups.         The periodic structure of collagen fibrils along their longitudinal axis can be characterised by the axial D-spacing, where this spacing was found to change with the presence of disease. The axial D-spacing for healthy breast tissues was found to be significantly lower in normal and mammoplasty tissues compared to invaded tissues (p = 0.0050 and p = 0.0093, respectively). However, no significant differences between the other tissue group pairs were seen (p &gt; 0.05). These differences were evident in classification modelling of the four tissue groups, where the amorphous scatter and the amplitude of a collagen axial peak were used to build a probability model for disease status. The model showed high sensitivities (&gt; 70%) and widely variable specificities (ranged from 18-97%) for the data examined with the synchrotron source. This means that the model was a good indicator of disease, but poor at indentifying healthy tissue types.         The work presented in this thesis shows that SAXS is capable of distinguishing breast tissue types with high sensitivity and has the potential to become a significant tool for the investigation of cancer progression or even diagnosis. Further investigation into the amorphous scatter and axial D-spacing in particular may provide insight into the biological mechanisms related to tissue degradation associated with invasive disease.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SAXS</field><field name="subject">Breast cancer</field><field name="subject">Collagen</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/73839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inhibitory control in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</field><field name="creator">Falconer, Erin Michelle, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder characterised by disturbed arousal, altered attention, and fear processing, and a reduction in the ability to perform cognitive tasks.  Predominant neurophysiological models of PTSD have been focused on alterations in fear-related regulation, and few incorporate broader changes in generic executive control which may underlie many of the clinical symptoms and cognitive deficits in PTSD. This thesis aimed to investigate the neurophysiology of executive inhibitory control in PTSD using a Go/NoGo response inhibition task and converging functional imaging, structural imaging and electrophysiological measures.  The first series of studies aimed to elucidate a normative neural network model of inhibitory control, and are consistent with normative control involving the activation of a mainly right-lateralised ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) network. Inhibitory control-related activation was found to be affected by levels of anxiety and changes in underlying neural structure; alterations in frontal cortical maturation and volume were related to additional activation of bilateral frontal cortical regions and the dorsal striatum, with anxiety increasing the demand on inhibitory control-related activation.  In contrast to healthy participants, PTSD was associated with reduced inhibitory control as indexed by inhibitory behaviour, diminished activation of the right VLPFC, and slowed inhibition-related information processsing.  PTSD participants relied on the greater activation of a left fronto-striatal inhibition network to support control, with the activation affected by levels of PTSD severity and comorbid anxiety.  This left fronto-striatal activation in PTSD was related to underlying increases in fronto-striatal neural structure.  Further, the ability to efficiently engage a left fronto-striatal network in PTSD during inhibitory control predicted better response to cognitive behavior for PTSD, consistent with the proposal that an improved ability to flexibly engage control systems may facilitate the resolution of PTSD symptoms.  Taken together, this program of research extends current neurophysiological model of PTSD to show that PTSD involves a fundamental disturbance in the function and structure of key fronto-striatal response control networks associated with inhibitory control.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fMRI</field><field name="subject">posttraumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">inhibition</field><field name="subject">ERP</field><field name="subject">MRI</field><field name="subject">executive control</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43563</field></doc><doc><field name="title">???Selling Consent???: From Authoritarianism to Welfarism at David Jones, 1838-1958</field><field name="creator">Pragnell, Bradley John, School of Industrial Relations &amp; Organisation Behaviour, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the history of labour management at David Jones, the major Australian retailer and manufacturer, between the years 1838 and 1958.  This thesis examines the development of consent-based approach to labour management at David Jones, in particular the development of paternalism and welfarism.  In doing so this thesis explores both general questions regarding the factors that influence why certain firms adopt a consent-based approach to labour management, as well as informing debates around the existence of nineteenth century paternalism and the origins of twentieth century welfarism.  The historical material contained at the David Jones Archives and elsewhere reveals little evidence of paternalism as a deliberate management strategy.  This brings into question the usefulness of paternalism as a concept in the historical study of Australian labour management.  The inability to trace paternalism also undermines explanations of twentieth century welfarism premised on the pre-existence of nineteenth century paternalism.  The historical materials, however, do note that twentieth century welfarism was a deliberate labour management strategy adopted by David Jones management.  Welfarism, combined with systematic management and training, was initially adopted following the First World War to deal with the threat of industrial turmoil.  However, in the 1930s, welfarism increasingly became a pro-active strategy designed to create skilled selling and raise the profile of the firm within the community.  Further, welfarism at David Jones in the inter-war period was more than merely a new form of paternalism, somehow transformed by being in a larger, more bureaucratic setting or a result of employers confronted an increasingly feminised workforce. Welfarism at David Jones was a deliberate strategy, informed by overseas experiments, management consultants and the new science of psychology.  Welfarism at David Jones continued into the post World War Two period.  However, new forms of retailing, in particular self-service, undermined attempts to create skilled selling.  Elements of welfarism remain at David Jones and continue to support the firm???s corporate image as a provider of high-quality customer service.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">David Jones Limited</field><field name="subject">Department stores Australia History</field><field name="subject">Retail trade Australia Management</field><field name="subject">Clerks</field><field name="subject">Retail trade</field><field name="subject">Labor unions</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Document management and retrieval for specialised domains: an evolutionary user-based approach</field><field name="creator">Kim, Mihye, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Browsing marked-up documents by traversing hyperlinks has become probably the most important means by which documents are accessed, both via the World Wide Web (WWW) and organisational Intranets. However, there is a pressing demand for document management and retrieval systems to deal appropriately with the massive number of documents available. There are two classes of solution: general search engines, whether for the WWW or an Intranet, which make little use of specific domain knowledge or hand-crafted specialised systems which are costly to build and maintain. The aim of this thesis was to develop a document management and retrieval system suitable for small communities as well as individuals in specialised domains on the Web. The aim was to allow users to easily create and maintain their own organisation of documents while ensuring continual improvement in the retrieval performance of the system as it evolves. The system developed is based on the free annotation of documents by users and is browsed using the concept lattice of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). A number of annotation support tools were developed to aid the annotation process so that a suitable system evolved. Experiments were conducted in using the system to assist in finding staff and student home pages at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales. Results indicated that the annotation tools provided a good level of assistance so that documents were easily organised and a lattice-based browsing structure that evolves in an ad hoc fashion provided good efficiency in retrieval performance. An interesting result suggested that although an established external taxonomy can be useful in proposing annotation terms, users appear to be very selective in their use of terms proposed. Results also supported the hypothesis that the concept lattice of FCA helped take users beyond a narrow search to find other useful documents. In general, lattice-based browsing was considered as a more helpful method than Boolean queries or hierarchical browsing for searching a specialised domain. We conclude that the concept lattice of Formal Concept Analysis, supported by annotation techniques is a useful way of supporting the flexible open management of documents required by individuals, small communities and in specialised domains. It seems likely that this approach can be readily integrated with other developments such as further improvements in search engines and the use of semantically marked-up documents, and provide a unique advantage in supporting autonomous management of documents by individuals and groups - in a way that is closely aligned with the autonomy of the WWW.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information retrieval</field><field name="subject">Database management</field><field name="subject">Lattice theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19183</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of iron chelators as anti-proliferative agents against cancer : molecular mechanisms behind the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis</field><field name="creator">Le, Nghia Trung Van, School of Women???s &amp; Children???s Health, UNSW</field><field name="description">Iron (Fe) is a fundamental requirement for life since it is involved in many cellular processes critical for growth and proliferation. Indeed, studies which deplete Fe from neoplastic cells using specific chelating agents result in G1/S arrest and apoptosis. However, the precise role of Fe in the control of the cell cycle remains unclear. Chapter one of this thesis, discusses the potential mechanism(s) by which Fe chelators cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that this process involves multiple molecules and is highly complex. Thus, the studies presented in this thesis assess the effects of specific high affinity Fe chelators on the expression of molecules that may play important roles in cellular arrest and apoptosis. The general methodology used in these studies is summarized in chapter 2. In previous investigations Fe chelators such as 2-hydroxy-1-naphthylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (311) were shown to be far more potent anti-tumor agents than the clinically used ligand, desferrioxamine (DFO). Studies detailed in chapter 3, examined the expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the universal cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1 following Fe-deprivation. To further characterize the effects of chelators on cell cycle arrest, experiments compared their activity to the DNA-damaging agents, actinomycin D (Act D) and cisplatin (CP). The latter two compounds increase the expression of p53 and its target gene p21CIP1/WAF1. Incubation of normal and neoplastic cells with all agents resulted in increased accumulation of nuclear p53, with the effect being more pronounced for Act D and CP. As expected, both Act D and CP markedly increased nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein levels, while DFO and 311 caused a significant (p &amp;lt 0.0004) decrease. This result was surprising, since the WAF1 gene which encodes the universal cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1 was markedly up-regulated at the mRNA level following Fe chelation. Proteasomal inhibition studies demonstrated the partial involvement of proteasomes in decreasing nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 levels following DFO treatment. In contrast, the incubation of 311-treated cells with proteasomal inhibitors did not reverse the down-regulation of p21CIP1/WAF1 when compared to the control. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that only DNA-damaging agents and not Fe chelators increased the nuclear translocation of p21CIP1/WAF1. Collectively, this suggests that the chelators prevented translation of WAF1. Moreover, this decrease in nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein expression did not appear to be due to a general effect in which Fe chelators inhibited mRNA translation since the transferrin receptor 1 was markedly up-regulated (15-21- fold) by DFO or 311. The combination of 311 with Act D or CP prevented the marked p21CIP1/WAF1 nuclear accumulation normally observed in response to these DNAdamaging agents. Significantly, the effect of chelation on reducing nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 expression was reversed by the Fe-donor, ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), indicating that WAF1 translation was dependent on intracellular Fe levels. This study is the first to demonstrate that Fe chelators markedly up-regulate the mRNA expression of WAF1 but paradoxically inhibit its translation. The down-regulation of p21CIP1/WAF1 protein by chelators may be a novel mechanism by which these ligands cause G1/S arrest through cell cycle dysregulation. In chapter 4, gene arrays were used to assess the expression of molecules associated with cell cycle control and the p53 pathway following the incubation of cells with DFO, 311 or Act D. The N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (Ndrg1) was the only molecule identified that was specifically up-regulated by Fe chelation and not DNA-damage. Although the exact function of the Ndrg1 protein is unclear, previous studies have shown that this molecule markedly slows down tumor growth (Kurdistani et al. Cancer Res. 1998:58;4439-44) and acts as a potent metastasis suppressor protein (Bandyopadhyay et al. Cancer Res. 2003:63;1731-6). Subsequent experiments examined the mRNA and protein expression of Ndrg1 using reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. Incubation of cells with DFO or 311 resulted in a marked increase in the expression of Ndrg1 mRNA and protein within 3 h and 6 h, respectively. This increase in Ndrg1 after incubation with chelators was not found with their Fe complexes nor when the Fe-binding site had been synthetically inactivated. In addition, the induction of Ndrg1 following Fe chelation was correlated with the ligands??? permeability and anti-proliferative activity. Indeed, the up-regulation of Ndrg1 by Fe chelators can be readily reversed by Fe-repletion. Collectively, this indicates that the induction of Ndrg1 was dependent on intracellular Fe levels. Previous studies demonstrated for the first time that the transactivation of Ndrg1 was dependent on HIF-1?? and p53 stabilization. In contrast, investigations using fibroblasts derived from a HIF-1?? knockout (HIF-1??-KO) mouse demonstrated that the transcriptional upregulation of Ndrg1 following Fe chelation was mediated by a HIF-1??-dependent and - independent mechanism. In addition, subsequent experiments using the p53-deficient H1299 lung carcinoma cell line revealed that the transactivation of Ndrg1 was not dependent on p53 status after Fe-depletion. Collectively, the presented studies suggest that Ndrg1 may be a novel link between Fe metabolism and the control of proliferation. The up-regulation of Ndrg1 by potent Fe chelators is significant and may be beneficial in the prevention of tumor metastasis. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that the molecular mechanisms behind the G1/S arrest and apoptosis involved multiple molecules following Fe chelation. Indeed, this study shows a potential mechanism by which Fe chelators may cause cell cycle dysregulation through the down-regulation of nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein levels. In addition, the work presented identifies the up-regulation of the metastasis suppressor protein, Ndrg1, following Fe-deprivation. Collectively, the results indicate that potent Fe chelators can not only be used as anti-proliferative agents, but may also be beneficial at inhibiting tumor cell metastasis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Treatment</field><field name="subject">Iron chelates</field><field name="subject">Cell cycle</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Peptide modified electrochemical sensors for the detection of heavy metal ions</field><field name="creator">Chow, Edith, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this research, the determination of trace concentrations of heavy metal ions was investigated using peptide modified electrochemical biosensors. The biosensor has several advantages over atomic absorption spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry by offering greater simplicity in use and the possibility of determining the bioavailability of heavy metals. Oligopeptides were modified on the electrode surface through the spontaneous self-assembly of thiols on gold. Firstly, 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) was self-assembled onto the gold surface followed by activation of the carboxyl groups using a combination of carbodiimide and succinimide chemistry for coupling of the N-terminus of the peptide to occur.  Using this generic strategy, Gly-Gly-His was used for the determination of copper ions. Cu2+ was accumulated at the MPA-Gly-Gly-His modified electrode at open circuit potential followed by electrochemical measurements. The reduction of Cu2+ to form underpotential deposited copper in the Osteryoung square wave voltammogram was used for quantification. The influence of various factors on the performance was investigated and after the optimal conditions had been identified, the biosensor was used for Cu2+ calibration and was applied to the analysis of a real sample.	For Cd2+ detection, two different peptides covalently attached to MPA were investigated, g-Glu-Cys-Gly (GSH) and His-Ser-Gln-Lys-Val-Phe, with the latter sensor exhibiting a lower Cd2+ detection limit, higher sensitivity and greater selectivity. Although the success of MPA as a peptide linker to the gold surface had been shown for the detection of Cu2+ and Cd2+, a more viable approach was necessary for the stable detection of a wider range of metal ions. A more stable self-assembled monolayer of thioctic acid (TA) was identified in which human angiotensin I was attached. This alternate modification procedure was superior to MPA-angiotensin I for Pb2+ detection in terms of stability and reusability with the drawback being sensitivity. The newly identified strategy was also applied to the determination of Ag+ using TA-methionine enkephalin modified electrodes.	A sensor array for Cu2+ was also investigated as well as an extension to the simultaneous determination of multianalytes using four different modified electrodes. Combining a soft-modelling approach, the responses of Cu2+, Cd2+ and Pb2+ could be deconvoluted.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biosensors</field><field name="subject">electrochemistry</field><field name="subject">metal ions</field><field name="subject">peptides</field><field name="subject">heavy metals</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Overlapping in Japanese conversation: communication styles of Japanese long-term residents of Australia in terms of Japanese socio-cultural/gender norms</field><field name="creator">Iida, Sumiko, Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study analyses overlaps in naturally occurring multi-party conversations among Japanese long-term residents of Australia, to investigate how Australian culture influences their Japanese communication style. One of the study???s interests is how their gendered communication styles appear in Australian English culture. Japanese gendered communication styles have been discussed in the literature, for example that males interrupt females more than vice versa; active participation by males versus passive participation by females in mixed-gender conversations; self-oriented topic initiation by males versus other-oriented topic initiation by females etc. These styles were assumed to be rarely observed in their L1 communication styles in Australia, where English, in which gendered language is less distinctive than Japanese, is spoken, and gender-free society has been more emphasised and practiced than in Japan. Among conversations recorded by the two informants, three multi-party conversations per informant (i.e. six in total) were selected, in which over 2000 overlaps are observed. The study first established a framework of functional overlap classification in terms of the ownership of the conversational floor. Then, based on this frame, all overlaps were classified into a number of functional categories, and were analysed qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The results showed little differences in the Japanese communication styles of the long-term residents of Australia from the Japanese communication styles which have been discussed in the literature, such as frequent use of aizuchi and other cooperative overlaps at and other than at Transition Relevance Places. As for gendered communication style, at least socio-cultural norms between traditional Japanese husband and wife are observed in the informants??? communication style. Although a number of variables that surround the informants need to be considered, the results may suggest that Japanese socio-cultural norms are, at this stage, more stable and they maintain the communication style of the Japanese long-term residents of foreign culture in their first language communication more strongly than was expected. However, different trends may be observed in future.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Communication</field><field name="subject">Conversation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust control and state estimation via limited capacity communication networks</field><field name="creator">Malyavej, Veerachai, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Telecommunication networks become major parts in modern complex control systems recently. They provide many advantages over conventional point-to-point connections, such as the simplification on installation and maintenance with comparatively low cost and the nature requirement of wireless communication in remote control systems. In practice, limited resource networks are shared by multiple controllers, sensors and actuators, and they may need to serve some other information unrelated to control purpose. Consequently, the control system design in networked control systems should be revised by taking communication constraints, for example, finite precision data, time delay and noise in transmission, into account. This thesis studies the robust control and state estimation of uncertain systems, when feedback information is sent via limited capacity communication channels. It focuses on the problem of finite precision data due to the communication constraints. The proposed schemes are based on the robust set-valued state estimation and the optimal control techniques.  A state estimation problem of linear uncertain system is studied first. In this problem, we propose an algorithm called coder-decoder for uncertain systems. The coder encodes the observed output into a finite-length codeword and sends it to the decoder that generates the estimated state based on the received codeword. As an illustration, we apply the results in state estimation problem to a precision missile guidance problem using sensor fusion. In this problem, the information obtained from remote sensors is transmitted through limited capacity communication networks to the guided missile. Next, we study a stabilization problem of linear uncertain systems with state feedback. In this problem, the coder-controller scheme is developed to asymptotically stabilize the uncertain systems via limited capacity communication channels. The coder encodes the full state variable into a finite-length codeword and sends it to the controller that drives the system state to the origin. To achieve the asymptotic stability, we use a dynamic quantizer so that quantization noise converges to zero.  The results in both state estimation and stabilization problems can handle the problem of finite data rate communication networks in control systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robust control</field><field name="subject">Estimation theory</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of toxigenic bacillus species in rice products</field><field name="creator">Oh, Mi Hwa, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Bacillus cereus is the most prevalent pathogenic Bacillus species found in foods, causing food spoilage and two types of toxin-mediated food poisoning known as the diarrhoeal and emetic syndromes. Other Bacillus species, particularly B. subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. brevis, B. pumilus and B. thuringensis, have also been recognised as food poisoning bacteria of increasing concern, with reports of outbreaks of diarrhoeal or emetic food poisoning. This study involved a systematic ecological investigation of Bacillus species isolated from rice products, commonly associated with Bacillus emetic food poisoning, using cultural and molecular methods. A centrifugation-plating method, more sensitive than the conventional spread plating method, was developed and used to determine the occurrence and biodiversity of Bacillus species in rice, a well known source of B. cereus. Eight different Bacillus species, B. cereus/B. thuringiensis, B. mycoides, B. subtilis/B. mojavensis, B. licheniformis, B. pumilus, B. sphaericus/B. fusiformis and B. megaterium, as well as Paenibacillus species, identified by partial rDNA sequencing, were isolated from raw (uncooked) and cooked rice products. The diversity of the isolates at the subspecies (strain) level was investigated using the RAPD-PCR typing technique, which proved to be useful for differentiating strains of bacilli, revealing broad diversity among the strains. Generally, different genotypes were found in raw and cooked rice, with some isolates of the same RAPD pattern found in both raw and cooked rice. The toxigenic potential of Bacillus isolates were also determined by molecular and immunological analysis as well as an MEKC method, developed in this study for quantitative analysis of the emetic toxin, cereulide. The results revealed that most isolates from the B. cereus group were potentially or actually toxigenic and some isolates were able to produce both diarrhoeal and emetic toxins.

The research reported in this thesis employed artificial neural networks ??? a method that is capable of capturing complex nonlinear and configural relationships among variables ??? and the findings were compared to those obtained by the more traditional method of linear regression. Six datasets that comprise a range of occupations, personality inventories, and work performance measures were used as the basis of the analyses. A series of studies were conducted to compare the predictive performance of prediction equations that a) were developed using either artificial neural networks or linear regression, and b) differed with respect to the type and number of personality variables that were used as predictors of work performance. Studies 1 and 2 compared the two methods using individual personality variables that assess the broad constructs of the five-factor model of personality. Studies 3 and 4 used combinations of these broad variables as the predictors. Study 5 employed narrow personality variables that assess specific facets of the broad constructs. Additional methodological contributions include the use of a resampling procedure, the use of multiple measures of predictive performance, and the comparison of two procedures for developing neural networks. Across the studies, it was generally found that the neural networks were rarely able to outperform the simpler linear regression equations, and this was attributed to the lack of reliable nonlinearity and configurality in personality-work performance relationships. However, the neural networks were able to outperform linear regression in the few instances where there was some independent evidence of nonlinear or configural relationships. Consequently, although the findings do not support the  usefulness of neural networks for specifically improving the effectiveness of personality variables as predictors of work performance, in a broader sense they provide some grounds for optimism for organisational researchers interested in applying this method to investigate and exploit complex relationships among variables.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural networks</field><field name="subject">Regression analysis</field><field name="subject">Personality</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protein and fatty acid interactions during ultrafiltration</field><field name="creator">Priyananda, Pramith, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Proteins and fatty acids often exist in solutions containing biological matter that are treated with membranes. These proteins and fatty acids interact with each other as well as with the membranes thereby affecting the flux. Binding of fatty acids to proteins results in complexes that are much larger than fatty acid molecules. Exploitation of this size difference to remove difficult to separate fatty acids from aqueous solutions by ultrafiltration was investigated in this study. In addition, the fouling of membrane by the protein-fatty acid mixtures containing free dissolved fatty acids was studied using bovine albumin (BSA)-caprylic system. Binding of caprylic acid to native and pasteurized BSA was examined by diafiltering pre equilibrated fatty acid-BSA mixtures. The rate of mass transfer of fatty acid molecules through boundary film surrounding the protein molecules was estimated using a BSA solution as the adsorbent phase in an agitated column. A stirred cell fitted with a polyethersulfone membrane (30 kDa) was used for the diafiltrations. Accumulation of fatty acid in the BSA layers fouled on the membrane was also estimated. Binding studies indicate that a native BSA molecule (at pH 6.8) could bind 7 fatty acid molecules in specific binding cavities while approximately 44 molecules are bound onto the surface. When BSA was pasteurized the specific binding decreased from 7 to 2 indicating unfolding of the molecule. In addition, the total binding capacity decreased from 44 to 24 moles/BSA mole and the rate of mass transfer decreased from 4.5/min to 3.6/min, indicating heat induced aggregation of BSA. At alkaline pH levels fatty acid anion acts as an anionic surfactant stabilizing the molecular conformation of the protein and reducing fouling. When pH was lowered to 3, flux severely declined. Unusually large accumulation of fatty acid in  the deposited protein layers (caprylic/BSA ~ 10,000 moles) occurred indicating capillary condensation of undissociated fatty acids in the protein layer. Agitated column studies showed that proteins could be used as an adsorbent to remove hard to separate dissolved fatty acids from aqueous solutions. The separated protein-fatty acid complex may be further processed to manufacture animal feed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Protein binding</field><field name="subject">Fatty acids</field><field name="subject">Ultrafiltration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pain : a biographical analysis</field><field name="creator">Hendricks, J. M. G.</field><field name="description">An understanding of pain presupposes that the sufferer is able to use a language which is understood by all. Pain is always described in the language of experience and this experience, encountered by all, is nevertheless lived alone. The interpretive process provides the framework for this study which explores the experiences of five persistent pain sufferers. They have not had their pain validated by diagnosis and persistent pain has become the centrepiece of their existence. The use of epiphany moments illuminates an understanding of the essence of persistent pain experiences, and sufferers are provided with a voice to tell their own stories as their experiences unfold through events in time. These stories are then deconstructed and analysed in order to bring meaning to the lives described. This study found that the communal folklore of pain remains underpinned by dominant ideological forces and discursive practices which sustain the powerlessness of persistent pain sufferers. The sufferer is rendered powerless through medical technologies including the medical interview. Through language the perception of pain is understood and translated in such a way as to cause the sufferer to question the validity of their experience while accepting blame for the persistence of their pain and the need to have it stop. It was postulated that resistance to this process provides the mechanism through which persistent pain sufferers are able to surrender previously held notions of self to alternate identities, which encapsulate the embodied experience of pain. The sufferer can then move to a position where their persistent pain experience is validated.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pain</field><field name="subject">chronic pain</field><field name="subject">persistent pain</field><field name="subject">pain sufferers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chiral discrimination associated with complex molecules</field><field name="creator">Petherick, Janice</field><field name="description">This thesis is a report on the design, synthesis and molecular structure of a set of chiral Co(III) metal complexes, in the solution and solid state.

The differences observed in the bonded tetradentate ligands were due to the chirality of the bonded amino acid.

In this study the membrane disruptive nature of the terpenoids has been determined by experiments on the effects of terpenes on both microbial membrane and model lipid bilayer systems. These terpenes exhibited a range of membrane damaging effects. Experiments showed that the terpenoids were able to increase disorder in DPPC bilayers, and that antimicrobially active terpenoids cause increased membrane permeability in living cells. The effect of molecular structure on antimicrobial activity and activity differences between each organism were determined for 60 terpenoids. Terpenoids with a low water solubility were found to be inactive. Hydrogen bond donor capacity and hydrogen bond acceptor capacity were found to be the molecular parameters which most strongly discriminated between activities against individual organisms. Activity against Gram negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was associated also with a molecular size parameter. The protective nature of the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa and E. coli was also investigated. The evidence presented in this thesis has enabled the postulation of a two stage process to explain the overall mode of action of these compounds.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">terpenes</field><field name="subject">terpenoids</field><field name="subject">cell membranes</field><field name="subject">metabolites</field><field name="subject">anti-infective agents</field><field name="subject">essential oils</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Audio-visions : domestic videogame play</field><field name="creator">Denham, Geoffrey Walter</field><field name="description">The domestic playing of videogames is examined through a series of extended dialogues with male adolescents. The research process was grounded in a theorisation of audience activity in communication studies which sees meanings emerging from the boys&#8217; engagements with kinetic texts in terms of refigurative activity. This encapsulates reading, interpretation, and a cultural productivity whereby the kinetic text is returned to the everyday world, primarily through a relation of mimicry. The cultural fertility of videogames is traced through this mimicry to reveal a series of themes: a de-stabilising of the distinction between work and play spaces; the fragmentation of audiences of the small screen in the home through the establishment of gendered playspaces; the instilling of competitive relations within male community; and the melding of fantasy and discipline. An investigation of the significance of soundtrack to videogame play leads to the conclusion that in videogame playing a new cultural competency is taking shape in the form of a postmodern literacy, which lays stress on a continuous circumlocution, a destabilizing of narrative time, and middles rather than beginnings or endings. The findings contradict many ideas regarding videogame playing: that players are addicts; that videogame play is mindless; or that players are fickle. Videogame playing is implicated as an identity-making discursive project considered central to the business of being a male adolescent.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">video games</field><field name="subject">electronic games</field><field name="subject">adolescent psychology</field><field name="subject">child psychology</field><field name="subject">computer games</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asynchronous transfer mode security</field><field name="creator">Shankaran, Rajan</field><field name="description">There is a growing interest in the development of broadband services and networks for commercial use in both local area and wide area networks. The primary reasons for this is a pressing need to meet the demand for increased bandwidth for remote sites interconnection, and in high speed data transfer of bulk data such as images etc. There has also been a significant change in the characteristics of network traffic. It is increasingly taking the form of bursty traffic characterized by an unpredictable demand for bandwidth of several megabytes. A new generation of networking technologies have emerged to meet the demand of growing and uncertain bandwidth requirements. One such technology is called Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) for use on broadband networks under the banner of broadband ISDN. ATM enables interconnection at high speeds in the range of Mbit/s or Gbit/s over wide areas, which effectively moves the bottleneck from networks to end systems. Furthermore, the user is able to access bandwidth on demand and the user is only charged for the bandwidth actually used. As more and more information (audio, image and data) is transferred over ATM networks, security issues are becoming increasingly critical. The rapidly growing use of the Internet to transfer confidential and sensitive information only enhances the importance of security services. One may even argue that the success of ATM will be determined not by its cost effectiveness but also to the level of trust that can be placed on its performance, security and availability. The objective of this dissertation is to address the issues involved in the design of security services for ATM networks.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ATM</field><field name="subject">bandwidth</field><field name="subject">broadband</field><field name="subject">ISDN</field><field name="subject">remote</field><field name="subject">interconnection</field><field name="subject">data transfer</field><field name="subject">security</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">megabytes</field><field name="subject">image</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Not falling off the planet : womens' experiences of recovery after a heart attack and cardiac rehabilitation</field><field name="creator">McMaster, Rose</field><field name="description">Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality in industrialised countries. There have been major changes in world wide population demographics with an increase in heart disease in those over sixty five years of age. The incidence of coronary heart disease in women increases with age. There has been little research into cardiovascular disease in women; treatment and rehabilitation programs have mainly been focused towards men and their needs. The population for this study consisted of women who had a heart attack for the first time, and who had attended cardiac rehabilitation. The sample was therefore purposeful, to include women who had experienced the phenomenon being studied. Six women, ranging in age from fifty five to sixty seven were interviewed. A combination of methods was incorporated to analyse the women's experiences and to organise the data. Four major themes emerged from the data: loss of autonomy; coping ; role changes and expectations; and changed relationships. The loss of autonomy felt by these women incorporated feelings of restrictions, dependence, loss of control and loss of self. The theme of role changes and expectations incorporated impediement of role and different roles. The last theme explored was changed relationships and incorporated thinking of others, family involvement and guilt and anger versus gratitude. Implications of the research include restructuring education and counselling programs to suit women's needs, evaluation of cardiac programs, recognition of family and friend's involvement in the recovery process. There needs to be encouragement of open communication between all concerned about problems coping with roles, expectations, limitations and family involvement. Suggestions for future research include a larger study being attended, with different sociocultural, economic and age group participants. Family and friend's involvement and viewpoint into the recovery process and cardiac rehabilitation would also help enrich health professionals' knowledge base.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">cardiac</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="subject">family</field><field name="subject">economic</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">counselling</field><field name="subject">heart disease</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Model predictive control of a robot using neural networks</field><field name="creator">Wei, Zhouping</field><field name="description">The aim of the thesis is to develop a model-based control strategy, namely, the Model Predictive Control (MPC) method, for robot position control using artificial neural networks. MPC is primarily developed for process control. Therefore its application in robot control has been less reported. In addition, conventional MPC uses linear model of the system for prediction which leads to inaccuracy for highly non-linear systems, such as robot. In this thesis a simulation model of a modified PUMA robot is constructed. This model is built using both MATLAB/SIMULINK and FORTRAN languages. In this model, the full robot dynamics is used together with the realistic factors, such as the actuator effects and the gear backlash, to represent the real system accurately. All simulations throughout this thesis are carried out on this model. A model predictive control strategy for robot trajectory tracking is also introduced in this thesis. The feasibility of the proposed MPC control method is studied based on a perfect prediction model, a model with uncertainties, and when the frequency band of the MPC controller is limited. Furthermore, a new method of using neural networks for robot dynamics modelling is introduced. This method is developed on the basis of a numerical differential technique that eliminates the explicit requirement of robot joint accelerations. Therefore, this method can be easily implemented on physical systems. As the measurements of the robot joint positions, velocities, and torques collected from operating the robot can be used to train the neural network, a more accurate dynamic model can be obtained. Finally, the MPC control method and the neural network model are combined together to form a neural network based MPC controller. The validity of this method is verified by using simulation on the simulated robot system</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="subject">tracking</field><field name="subject">neural</field><field name="subject">circuit</field><field name="subject">robot</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Queer kinaesthesia : on the dance floor at gay and lesbian dance parties Sydney, 1994-1998</field><field name="creator">Bollen, Jonathan James</field><field name="description">What is happening on the dance floor at the gay and lesbian dance parties? What are lesbians and gay men doing when they dance? This thesis presents a project in performance research that takes as its locus on investigation the dance parties that have been produced annually by gay and lesbian organisations in Sydney since the early 1980s. In particular, it focuses on the largest of these dance parties, Mardi Gras Party and Sleaze Ball, during a period of research from 1994 to 1998. Harnessing these resources, the thesis aims at investigating how dance parties sustain an ongoing salience for gay men and lesbians in Sydney. On the basis of ethnographic research, performance documentation, and movement analysis, the investigation pursues an analytical trajectory across the making of dance parties within a subcultural scene, to the doing of dance parties as performance events, and then onto the dance floor as a site for performative practice. Responding to a persistent debate about straights at the parties, the anlayses register the salience of dancing as an etiquette of doing dance party as it is done, as a queer kinaesthesia sustained on the dance floor, and as an occasional community danced into existence. The thesis attests to the pertinence of analysing movement. It analyses the mobility of practice, rather than its textual residue; the kinaesthesia of performative identities, rather than their morphological contours; and the choregraphy of community, rather than its substantive contents. Recognising that queer theory too has an interest in movement, in proliferating metaphors for the mobility of queer identifications and desires, the thesis argues in conclusion that such metaphors represent imaginative flights of fancy to the extent that they fail to grasp the corporeality of queer kinaesthesia</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lesbian</field><field name="subject">Mardi Gras</field><field name="subject">Sleaze Ball</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">gay</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Returning to Asia : Japan in the cultural dynamics of globalisation, localisation and Asianisation</field><field name="creator">Iwabuchi, Koichi</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the re-articulation of Japan's cultural connections with Asia in the1990s through popular cultural flows. This is a time when the ascent of Asian economic power has encouraged Japan to stress its Asian identity again, and the forces of media globalisation have facilitated intra-regional cultural flow in Asia. In this context, popular culture, particularly TV programmes and popular music, which arguably embody the ongoing formation of Asian cultural modernity through cultural indigenisation of Western cultural influence, has become a key site where Japan's historically constituted ambivalent relation with other Asian nations has been newly articulated. I shall look at various facets of Japan's 'return to Asia' through the analysis of Japanese discourses on its international cultural influence; through the empirical examination of the promotion, production and reception of Japanese popular music and TV programmes in East and Southeast Asian markets; and through the analysis of Japanese media representation of Asian societies and Japanese fans' reception of Hong Kong popular culture. 'Asia' in the 1990s has evoked Japan's repetitious nationalist desire for a trans-Asian expansion of its cultural imaginary. However, as popular cultural flows have made Japan's encounter with Asia more immediate and concrete, Japan's cultural nationalist project has been reconfigured within a transnational framework which increasingly capitalises on the regional cultural resonance in Asia. In the process, the asymmetrical power relationship between Japan and Asia and Japan's condescending sense of being 'in the above Asia' have been renewed, ruptured and refracted in complex and contradictory ways</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">television</field><field name="subject">TV</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">Hong Kong</field><field name="subject">popular culture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the extracellular matrix in wool follicle development</field><field name="creator">Moore, Anthony G.</field><field name="description">Molecular and behavioural characterisation of ovine dermal papilla cells performed in this study indicate they synthesise a highly specialised extracellular matrix (ECM). This is conserved between different species and distinguishes papilla cells from dermal fibroblasts with which they have a common origin. The composition of the dermal papilla ECM is temporally and spatially regulated during wool follicle development. It was shown that the ECM associated with dermal papilla cells in foetal sheep skin becomes specialised in regard to chondroitin sulphate synthesis prior to the appearance of follicle primordia. Chrondroitin sulphate and fibronectin were present in the ECM of dermal papilla cells throughout follicle development and during fibre production. Cellular differentiation antigen 44 was present in the ECM od papilla cells exclusively during the formation of dermal papilla, while laminin was present in the dermal papilla ECM of fibre producing follicles only. Co-operation between chondroitin sulphate, fibronectin, and CD44 in regulating the agrregative and proliferative behaviour of papilla cells was demonstrated in culture. Finally, the inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis in newborn mouse skin was found to disrupt the growth of existing follicles and the generation of new ones. Together these findings demonstrate that chondroitin sulphate is intimately associated with the earliest interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal cells during the formation of follicle primordia. It is likely that the interactions specifically involve fibronectin and CD44, and possibly other ECM molecules which have he effect of regulating the behaviour of papilla cells</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">papilla cells</field><field name="subject">sheep skin</field><field name="subject">follicles</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">wool growth</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/389</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategies for the use of interactive multimedia to train extension workers in developing countries</field><field name="creator">Wijekoon, R. R. A.</field><field name="description">A key feature of recent agricultural extension programs has been the focus on increased participation for local, rural communities in the overall decision-making process. This move towards increasing community participation has raised expectations in terms of communication: communication between central research facilities and rural communities, between rural communities and central research facilities, and amongst the rural communities themselves. In order to provide effective communication along each of these channels, attention is turning to the extension trainers deployed in the field. For extension trainers this emerging communication role is distinct from, and supplementary to, the conventional technical training function. The thesis highlights the lack of effective training in communication skills in existing extension training programs. It identifies the flip chart as the most widely used visual aid for farmer training, and the overhead projector as the most widely used visual aid for in-service training. The thesis develops a comprehensive set of training competencies and content for teaching those two technologies, derived from individual task analyses and an extensive literature review. A range of strategic alternatives for the delivery of those competencies in a developing country are then formulated and examined. Central to the different strategies considered is the use of interactive multimedia as a key delivery technology. Two proprietary CDROMs have been designed and produced specifically to the support training in the design and production skills for overhead projector and flip chart technologies. The design, content and production of the CDROMs is described, and both technical and user evaluations are presented. The two CDROMs have been field-tested in Sri Lanka, across a broad range of strategic alternatives. The outcome is a set of guidelines and specific structures for training programs in overhead projector and flip chart technologies. The guidelines are generic and broadly applicable. The case studies also indicate a particular subset of preferred strategies for the future deployment of interactive multimedia-based training in developing countries. Most specifically, the thesis indicates a balance between and the need for mix of interactive multimedia modules along with face-to-face training support</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interactive multimedia</field><field name="subject">overhead projector</field><field name="subject">CDROMs</field><field name="subject">Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">flip chart</field><field name="subject">communities</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoria : performance and epistemology</field><field name="creator">Fleming, Chris, 1970-</field><field name="description">What might it mean to attempt to figure theatre as thought?

This study is a series of cross-disciplinary engagements that seek to articulate some of the relations between theatre, performance, and epistemology, to investigate performance as a 'deployed logic' in relation to those disciplines concerned with discovering and generating knowledge. For some thinkers in the continental tradition, the very thought of writing about the relations between performance and the anachronistic; hasn't the idea of 'performance' undermined most of the central tenets of the discourse concerned with knowledge and the Real, with truth and falsity? This, of course, remains an open question, one pursued in this work.

It was also determined that the primary cause of vitrification is high relative humidity resulting in a lack of transpiration in vitro but that other factors such as unbalanced mineral nutrition or high medium cytokinin can exacerbate vitrification.Further research in tissue culture may investigate the influence of relative humidity on plant growth and morphology, the mechanism by which plants exclude water from their intercellular spaces and refine in vitro tissue mineral analysis as a means by which critical mineral concentrations can be determined.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plant tissue culture</field><field name="subject">plant physiology</field><field name="subject">vitrification</field><field name="subject">relative water content</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biodegradation of xanthate by microbes isolated from a tailings lagoon and a potential role for biofilm and plant/microbe associations</field><field name="creator">Lam, Kin-San</field><field name="description">Xanthates, key compounds used in the mining industry for the separation of metals from ores, may have a significant impact on the ecosystems once discarded into the tailings. The aims of this study were to : characterize chemical and microbiological conditions in a tailings lagoon (Brown Creek gold mine); examine the feasability of using indigenous bacteria to degrade xanthate under laboratory conditions; and, optimize the biodegradation process by employing biofilm technology and plant-microbe associations. To achieve these, a simple but accurate HPLC method was developed. The chemical and biological constitution of the tailings lagoon was monitored over a 2 year period from March 1995 to February 1997. Xanthate degradative performance was improved by Phragmites australis and its root associated bacterial community. Cumulative amounts of xanthate degraded by this plant-microbe association were significantly higher than any other treatment, specifically glass-attached and free-living bacterial populations. An increased bacterial number in the extensively developed root, the presence of extracellular layer as revealed from scanning electron microscope and significance of plant removal via uptake were thought to be the possible explanations for the enhanced biodegradation activity observed. In view of the above, use of glass-attached bacteria and plant-microbe associations might provide a feasible solution to degrade xanthate in the tailings lagoon. The results obtained from this study suggest that the plant-microbe associations could provide a cost effective method to degrade/remove xanthate from the tailings lagoon runoff. This approach offers several ecological advantages. Firstly, it offers the advantage of a solar-powered treatment system that is aesthetically pleasing. Secondly, bioremediation can be done on site, thereby eliminating waste transportation costs.

Whilst some dual methods have been used in urban economic modelling in the past this paper proposes alternative dual approaches which appear to be novel, but are complimentary to existing approaches to the urban model. As part of the application of dual techniques the paper proposes a method of application which is general enough to be applied to all Von Thunen type models and tests this proposition on the fundamental agrarian model of Von Thunen. As part of the dual analysis of the urban residential model the conditions for the traditional lot size hypothesis are examined in the light of conditional demand functions stemming from the dual analysis. The work also empirically tests the traditional residential lot size hypothesis for various Australian cities. The empirical method adopted involves estimation of density gradients utilising competing non-nested flexible form models and discrimination between these alternative models utilising semi-parametric non-nested tests based on an artificial regression model. Two of the three competing models have not been used in this context before, one of them being completely novel. Moreover, the artificial regression model has not been previously used in this context, requiring some modification to deal with the problem of competing models with dependent variable transformation.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urban</field><field name="subject">residential</field><field name="subject">economic modelling</field><field name="subject">location</field><field name="subject">Von Thunen</field><field name="subject">variable</field><field name="subject">transformation</field><field name="subject">Australian cities</field><field name="subject">regression</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I'd rather not be in Marrickville : aerial modernities and the domestication of the sublime</field><field name="creator">Lloyd, Justine</field><field name="description">Since the first flights in Sydney in 1910, the problem of exactly where to locate Sydney's airport has preoccupied and troubled planners, politicians and residents of the city. This thesis examines Sydney airport as a space, site and symbol under contestation by major social forces - Zukin - throughout the twentieth century. In doing so, it seeks to question the claims of both planners and anti-airport protestors to resolve and manage large-scale urban developments. Via a series of case studies of representations of the airport, the thesis develops an argument for understanding the airport as a heterotopia: neither sublime nor abject, but through such an extremist spatial imaginary pointing to the production of modernist space as a highly contested process. Because it localises and materialises discourses on the nature and goals of progress,internationalisation and globalisation, it is argued that the built form of the airport is, and will continue to be, a key site of such aerial modernity. The final chapter closely reads a series of airport tales- (a film, a play and a park) in order to consider the ways in which they rework the modernist sublime in domestic space.It is concluded that these stories offer a method of representing locality that goes beyond the existing understandings of locality as an essence of place. The appeal of the narratives lies in the shift that they develop, through excessive and negotiated representations of both the domestic and the sublime, from the local as essence, to locality as practice.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aeronautics</field><field name="subject">city planning</field><field name="subject">Kingsford-Smith airport</field><field name="subject">airports</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">aeronautical history</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Capital Asset Pricing Model : a test on the Stock Exchange of Singapore</field><field name="creator">Garg, Vivek</field><field name="description">Of the many analytical methods collectively referred to as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is the most familiar to today&#8217;s generation of students of finance. The popularity of the CAPM arises from its success in expressing a powerful theoretical insight in a simple, usable form. The primary use of the CAPM is to determine minimum required rates of return from investment in risky assets. The variable in the CAPM is called &#8216;beta&#8217;, a statistical measure of risk which has become familiar to all finance professionals. Over the past decade, beta has become the most widely recognised and applied measure of risk in the investment community. The model has been extensively tested in the developed capital markets, mainly in the United States of America. But the model has not been extensively tested in other developed and developing countries, often due to the size of the capital market and the lack of the data in these countries. This study attempts to fill this vacuum and tries to update the earlier tests done on the Stock Exchange of Singapore. On addition, a review of the validity of the CAPM over time, as proxied by the stationarity of the beta, is performed.

Quality of nursing is important for acutely ill older people who are the largest group of patients in terms of hospital admissions. The ageing population is a major focus for social and economic planners and policy makers. There is an increasing need for health systems to change their focus to more closely assess strategies used to manage the acutely ill older hospital population. The main aim of this study was to improve the quality of nursing care for older, acutely ill, hospitalised medical patients. The study used a mixed method triangulated approach that utilised quantitative and qualitative methods to survey perceived needs of older patients, their family members/carers and the nursing staff, in the process of developing, implementing and evaluating a new model of care using a participatory action research (PAR) process. There were three specific objectives. The first was to evaluate which aspects of nursing care were considered most important for older patients during acute hospitalisation from the perspective of older patients, their family members/carers and their nurses. The second was to develop and implement a model of care that addressed the identified nursing care needs and priorities of older patients through the PAR process. The third was to determine whether employing a PAR process, the chosen model of care addressed the identified nursing care needs and priorities and resulted in increased patient satisfaction and improved health care for older patients. This study demonstrated the implementation of a PAR process to motivate nursing staff, utilising an evidence-based model of care approach, resulted in changes to clinical nursing practice that impacted positively on older patients&#8217; and nursing staff&#8217;s satisfaction with care provided, patient knowledge and final health outcomes. It is recommended that the findings of this study be applied to develop guidelines for acutely hospitalised medical patients, particularly for issues relating to educational sessions to increase the patient&#8217;s functional activities and knowledge levels of their medication regimes prior to discharge.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing care</field><field name="subject">aged care</field><field name="subject">medical patients</field><field name="subject">quality of care</field><field name="subject">geriatric nursing</field><field name="subject">hospital care of the aged</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The complex nature of the ISM in the SMC</field><field name="creator">Stanimirovic, Snezana</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of a combination of new observations with the Parkes telescope of neutral hydrogen (HI) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with an Australia Telescope Compact Array aperture synthesis mosaic. The data are used to study the HI distribution and mass, the velocity field and rotation curve of the SMC, as well as to probe the 3-D structure of the SMC. A kinematic study of the HI data reveals the existence of three supergiant shells which were previously undetectable in the ATCA data alone. The HI spatial power spectrum has been investigated over a range of contiguous scale sizes wider than those previously achieved in any other galaxy. This thesis also demonstrates that the infrared data obtained with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite for the SMC can be successfully reconstructed with much higher resolution using the Pyramid Maximum Entropy algorithm. The new infrared (IR) data are used to study the integrated IR spectrum, the dust temperature and dust column density in the SMC. The high resolution HI and IR data enable an investigation of the spatial correlation of dust and gas and the assumption of the dust and gas being well-mixed in the ISM. The spatial power spectrum of the dust column density shows that, as with the HI power spectrum, there is no preferred scale size for dust clouds. The remarkable similarity of the spatial power spectra for the HI and dust column density distributions suggests a unique hierarchical structure organisation for the ISM in the SMC. Such an organisation is likely to be governed by the Kolmogorov type turbulence and could be described by fractal nature with the volume fractal dimension of 2.4.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kolmogorov</field><field name="subject">Parkes telescope</field><field name="subject">Small Magellanic Cloud</field><field name="subject">spectrum</field><field name="subject">dust column</field><field name="subject">density</field><field name="subject">infrared</field><field name="subject">entropy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conditions for the effective formation, management and evolution of cross-border alliances</field><field name="creator">Milgate, Michael</field><field name="description">The subject of cross-border alliances, and of cooperative strategy generally, is one that has been growing in importance over the last ten to fifteen years, both for practitioners and for academics.

However, little is known of the mechanisms within the wool follicle that regulate fibre production. The aim of the research described here was to identify and characterise some of the genes expressed in the follicle.A highly expressed gene has been identified from skin and sequenced. The information obtained on this gene suggests that it might be of use in future transgenic studies. Two cDNA libraries were constructed. The first was constructed using small amounts of total RNA from skin and PCR methodology, following a published method. A second cDNA library was then produced from adult mid-flank skin using a commercially available kit. A pool of 420 potential wool follicle specific transcripts were identified from this adult mid-flank skin cDNA library using a combination of differential and subtractive screening. Clone 1-25 was chosen as the focus for the remaining work described in this thesis. Expression of clone 1-25 was detected at all stages of wool follicle development and was localised to the wool follicle bulb, inner root sheath, outer root sheath, epidermis, but not the dermis or dermal papilla. The function of clone 1-25 is as yet unknown.

Thematic analysis was used to explicate from the text 30 sub-themes, five themes (being in a gap between cultures and creating space for themselves, being traumatised and diminished by abuse, surviving dangerous relationships, suffering psychic pain, expressing the self by attempting suicide), and a meta-theme (paradoxically asserting the indefinite self). Interpretation was predicated on the belief that life stories are statements about self-identity, and represent coming into being through the interaction of coherence (the ability to establish connections between events, unifying themes, frames of reference and goal states), continuity (a longitudinal and sequential perspective on life) and connectedness (intrapersonal, interpersonal and transpersonal relationships). The paradox is that being unable to overcome the uncertainties of incoherence, discontinuity and problematic connectedness, participants were predisposed to act against self as a means of asserting agency.

P.</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the search for the sublime in a contemporary context. The 'Wilderness' can be viewed as a metaphysical space which can only be circumscribed. The dust storms of the Australian continent provides the space where in this experience is located, metaphorically. If the perceptions of reality are to be seen as filtered through the experiences and conditions of the human spirit, the sites or 'Stations' as the author has called them layer and reveal a personal reflection on the timelessness and commonality of the human condition. Space and time seem to collapse folding over and into itself, with a layering of memories and senses. Growing up in the Mallee in Victoria the author's formative years were shaped particularly by the land and the elements. In these works, the sense of identity is enveloped into a rather cosmic sense of being, when the author became inseparable from the red earth, its duststorms, the sense of space and the feeling of isolation. The most constant experience is that of the sense of interconnectedness and of being able to reach down and stroke the land from a distant vantage point. Consequently, the spiritual found in nature has been a re-occurring motif in the author's artistic practice. The location of the duststorm entitled 'God's Breath', is in flying over Adelaide, towards the Mallee. The grid indicates the impositions of perception which is projected on the land by the viewer, often from a cultural or political viewpoint. In this case the author's perception is influenced by the auto-biographical gaze and the duststorm itself becomes a metaphor for memory and interiority. The medium of wax as a preserving substance is used in the artworks, however this can be seen as being an agent of change, able to re-define it's form according to environmental conditions. The land as 'Self' or 'Mother' is not a constant location, but as in the 'Wilderness' can be seen as a spiritual and/or psychological space, a multi-dimensional filter for the senses and the mind, wherein the spirit can be expanded and be still in it's receptiveness. The four wax rectangles are representative of a duststorm, as seen from the interior perspective of the sensory. These works suggest a multitudinal level of experiences, not necessarily definable but open ended in concept. The void as a creative fullness nurtures the more transient moments of the sensory and temporal. From scarification and pain, through breath and loss, the journey through the wilderness results in a melodic tonal experience, indicative of memory, place and identity</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">duststorms</field><field name="subject">Judy Watson</field><field name="subject">Holy Grail</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal identity</field><field name="subject">sense of being</field><field name="subject">journey</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zinc electrowinning in the presence of iron (II)</field><field name="creator">Adcock, Peter Anthony</field><field name="description">In the hydrometallurgical processing route for primary production of zinc, one of the most significant impurities in terms of cost of processing is iron. In the last two decades, electroplating of steel sheet with alloys such as zinc/iron has seen considerable industrial development. In this process, there is an 'anomalous co-deposition', in which zinc is deposited at a higher rate than iron, even though it is more cathodic in the electrochemical series.In the 1980's research papers reported high current efficiencies for zinc electroplating in the presence of a comparable concentration of iron. It is of interest to the zinc industry to know conditions under which zinc could be electrowon efficiently without prior separation of iron. The chief aim of the current project was to obtain data which would allow evaluation of a zinc electrowinning step carried out in the presence of iron. It was necessary to understand the robustness of such a process towards variations in parameters such as electrolyte composition and purity, temperature, and current density. Means of producing smooth, strippable deposits at high current efficiencies also required evaluation. In order to electrolyse high iron solutions at high current efficiency, it is necessary to introduce a separator into the cell, to prevent cycling of iron oxidation at the anode and reduction at the cathode. The focus of this project was on the cathode process, particularly the determination of factors influencing morphology and current efficiency. Experiments involved modifications of some cells typically used in studies of conventional zinc electrowinning. A range of techniques for morphological studies and for electrochemical tets was evaluated for application to this problem, as well as to studies of conventional zinc electrowinning operations</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electrolysis</field><field name="subject">electroplating</field><field name="subject">zinc production</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/669</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of weld-induced imperfections on the stability of axially loaded steel silos</field><field name="creator">Pircher, Martin</field><field name="description">The strength of thin-walled cylindrical shell structures is highly dependent on the nature and magnitude of imperfections. Most importantly, circumferential imperfections have been reported to have an especially detrimental effect on the buckling resistance of these shells under axial load. Due to the manufacturing techniques commonly used during the erection of steel silos and tanks, specific types of imperfections are introduced into these structures, among them circumferential weld-induced imperfections between strakes of steel plates. The main objective of this thesis was to investigate the exact nature of these circumferential welds and their influence on the buckling resistance of silos and tanks under axial load. The results of a survey of imperfections in existing silos at a location in Port Kembla / Australia (Ding 1992) were used to develop and calibrate a shape function which accurately describes the geometric features of circumferential weld imperfections. It was found that after filtering out the effects of overall imperfections, three parameters governed the shape of the surveyed imperfections: the depth; the wave length; and the roundness. A study on several factors influencing the buckling of silos and tanks was carried out using the finite element method. The interaction between neighbouring circumferential weld imperfections was investigated and it was found that the influence on the buckling behaviour depended on the strake height in relation to the linear meridional bending half wave length and the depth of the imperfection. The strengthening effect of weld-induced residual stress fields for a range of different geometries was also studied, and diagrams were derived giving the influence of the newly developed shape function on the buckling behaviour. A post-buckling analysis was undertaken and a model for the post-buckling behaviour of cylindrical thin-walled shells with circumferential weld imperfections was developed. The methods used for the analysis of thin-walled cylinders were applied in a study on the buckling behaviour of welded box-sections. It was found that weld-induced residual stress fields governed the buckling behaviour of these columns</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">welded steel structures</field><field name="subject">welded joints</field><field name="subject">silo design and construction</field><field name="subject">tank design and construction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/687</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Easy : a novella</field><field name="creator">De Iacovo, Joe</field><field name="description">Tony is a car thief reliant on loyalty so that he may flourish.

The living environment of Singapore has been changed with in the last 25 years. My thesis mainly describes foods and food markets in Singapore. Due to better educational background, higher consumption power and small family planning, the eating habit of Singaporeans has changed. A lot of young Singaporeans today, don't buy their daily marketing needs from the traditional wet market for they prefer to do their weekly marketing in the comfortable, clean, convenient and air conditioned modern supermarket. With the advance electronic cooking equipment in kitchen, they save time in cooking to buy prepared or instant cooked food from supermarkets, instead of raw foodstuff from the traditional wet markets. These rapid changes of the Singaporeans' life style and eating habit created an opportunity. For me to look into the area that directly or indirectly involved with my professional work as a practicing graphic designer and a design educator. The area I am looking into is 'the value of food packaging'. I realized that the contrast of the traditional foodstuffs selling in traditional wet market and the imported foodstuffs displayed within the modern supermarket, the difference has signaled a strong message. If the traditional foodstuffs still does not improve their dull and unhygienic image to catch up with the rapid changing urban living environment. They will disappear from our dining table sooner or later. My thesis has to reach 2 aims. Firstly, to awake the design students (tomorrow's designer). To be more sensitive towards the local traditional food markets. Discover the values of the local ethnic foodstuffs and going to find out why these delicious and remarkable local foodstuffs been rejected outside of the modern supermarket. To create a new image through packaging design to replace with the original dull and unhygienic image.

The study enhances current understandings of the processes through which backpackers interact with travel websites by including the social and personal context of their experience.  Analysing interview data on user attitudes and behaviour, it argues the importance of taking into account the use-context of human computer interactions. Placing participants&#8217; interaction with the newzealand.com website within themes of imagination, emotional engagement, and authenticity in experience allows an exploration of such context.  It demonstrates that backpackers&#8217; engagement with websites is shaped not only by their material circumstances but by their attitudes to travel in general, their assumptions and feelings about New Zealand as a place, and as a site for their own experiences.  The research applies usability techniques and methods to observe and inquire into tourists&#8217; experiential interaction with a destination website.  The emotional, affective, reflective and behavioural aspects of tourists&#8217; decision making processes are studied in order to show how websites, as a medium of communication, evoke users&#8217; travel imaginings.  In this way the study contributes to research into tourists&#8217; web-related motivation and behaviour. In addition, by applying discursive, performative, and experiential lenses drawn from travel research to human-computer interaction, it augments current research techniques for studying the social effects of virtual technology and web related human behaviour. The thesis explores themes of representation of place and self in relation to backpacker experiences and frames them in terms of authenticity and trust. It argues that in navigating places, backpackers seek authentic experiences and that this notion of authenticity is mediated by their encounters with other travellers, locals, tourism providers, as well as books, television and the Internet. Websites as travel information sources shape how backpackers think about their tourist experiences; to do this effectively, what the site presents must resonate with the backpacker&#8217;s views on how they think those experiences should be.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Experiential</field><field name="subject">User interactions</field><field name="subject">Destination marketing</field><field name="subject">Websites</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of corporate culture compatibility on supply chain performance</field><field name="creator">Al-Mutawah, Khalid</field><field name="description">Supply chain systems have become a vital component of successful networked business firms/organisations. Over the last three decades, there has been a dramatic growth globally in the formation of supply chain networks. Research, however, indicates that there has been an increase in reported supply chains failures, and the incompatibility issues between participated organisations. Yet, these incompatibility issues are not just technical, but encompass wider cultural, organisational, and economical factors. Whilst research has shown the effect of such factors on supply chain performance, the influence of achieving corporate culture compatibility to the success of supply chains remains poorly understood. This is because it is widely accepted that organisations that operate in the same region possess a similar culture. In contrast, this research will examine the existence of corporate culture diversity between organisations in the same region, rather than diversity of national culture across different regions. Specifically, the study described the development of corporate culture compatibility between supply chains&#8217; organisations and its influences on supply chain performance. Therefore, the thesis focus is the complex interrelationships between corporate culture compatibility of member organisations and supply chain performance. This research identifies cultural norms and beliefs of supply chain members within key organisational factors, rather than national or multi-national organisations factors, as in Hofstede (1983). A multi-method research design (combining case study, simulation, and neuro-fuzzy methods) was used to provide a rounded perspective on the phenomena studied. The multiple case studies helped to explore how corporate culture compatibility influences supply chain performance and develop a conceptual model for this association. The simulation experiments were conducted to verify the obtained conceptual framework from the multiple case studies, and investigate the effects of changing the corporate culture compatibility level on supply chain performance. The simulation is designed based on a Multi-Agent System (MAS) approach, in which each organisation in a supply chain is represented as an intelligent agent. Finally, a neuro-fuzzy approach is presented to assess corporate culture on supply chains context using real data. The analysis of the quantitative neuro-fuzzy study confirmed and validated the theoretical findings and adds depth to our understanding of the influences of corporate culture compatibility on supply chain performance. The study confirmed that organisations within the same supply chain in the same region possess different corporate cultures that consequently need the achievement of corporate culture compatibility as it is indicated by the literature. Moreover, the study revealed two types of corporate culture in supply chains&#8217; context: individual culture and common culture. Individual culture refers to the internal beliefs within the organisation&#8217;s boundary, while common culture refers to beliefs when trading with partners across the organisation&#8217;s boundary. However, the study shows that common culture has more influences on supply chain performance than individual culture. In addition, the study highlighted bi-directional association between individual culture and common culture that helps the supply chain&#8217;s organisations developing their corporate culture compatibility. The results from the current study also showed that supply chain performance was shown to arise dramatically in response to corporate culture compatibility level increases. Yet, this increase in performance is diminished at a higher level of corporate culture compatibility, because more corporate culture compatibility increases are not cost effective for the organisations. In addition, organisations at a higher level of compatibility have more preferences to preserve their individual culture because it represents their identity. Furthermore, the study complements the gap in the literature related to the assessment of corporate culture of individual organisations in supply chains for sustaining a higher supply chain performance. While current culture assessment models observe individual organisations&#8217; culture, the proposed approach describes a single concentrated model that integrates both individual and common culture in measuring influences of culture compatibility on supply chain performance. The findings from this study provide scholars, consultants, managers, and supply chain systems vendors with valuable information. This research thesis contributes to supply chain configuration and partnership formation theory, along with corporate culture theory, and is the first of its kind to establish the use of intelligent methods to model corporate culture compatibility. It is also one of the first empirical studies to compare corporate culture compatibility of supply chains&#8217; organisations from organisational perspectives, rather than national perspectives.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Supply chain</field><field name="subject">Corporate culture</field><field name="subject">Supply chain performance</field><field name="subject">Boundary objects</field><field name="subject">Cultural algorithms</field><field name="subject">Dempster-Shafer theory</field><field name="subject">Multi-Agent-System</field><field name="subject">Neuro-fuzzy</field><field name="subject">Corporate culture compatibility</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/73965</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Roles of c-Jun in angiogenesis and cancer: insights using gene targeting approaches</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Guishui, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular disease and cancer are the two most common causes of death worldwide. Angiogenesis plays a critical role tumourigenesis and atherogenesis. As a member of the basic region-leucine zipper protein family, c-Jun, has been linked with cell proliferation, migration and cell survival. However, the relationship between c-Jun and angiogenesis has not been firmly established.  In this thesis, strategies targeting c-Jun mRNA such as DNAzyme and siRNA have been designed and evaluated for their ability to inhibit the c-Jun mRNA and c-Jun protein expression in vitro and in vivo. These agents block c-Jun expression and inhibit DNA binding activity of c-Jun. Luciferase assay showed that c-Jun siRNA suppressed c-Jun/AP-1-dependent reporter activity. The processes of cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation were all down-regulated after treatment with c-Jun targeting agents. In vivo, c-Jun DNAzymes and siRNA inhibit angiogenesis in multiple models of angiogenesis in multiple models of angiogenesis, including tumour angiogenesis and growth, matrix angiogenesis, corneal angiogenesis and retinal neovascularization. This is mediated, at least in part, by c-Jun siRNA or DNAzyme inhibition of MMP-2 expression.  These findings demonstrate the critical role played by c-Jun in the involvement of neovascularization and suggest that DNAzymes or siRNAs are efficient gene-silencing agents. The ability to identify and control key genes in angiogenesis provides opportunities for developing therapeutic molecular tools to treat cancer or other angiogenesis related diseases.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiovascular disease -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Angiography</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental impact of stocked Mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus) in New South Wales estuaries</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Matthew David, Biological Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Studies were undertaken for estuarine stocking of mulloway Argyrosomus japonicus to develop efficient marking techniques; to identify key habitats and migratory patterns of stocked fish; to evaluate the diet and growth of stocked fish and recruitment to commercial fisheries; and to develop a numerical model to estimate optimal stocking density from the predatory impact of stocked fish. The 10-step responsible approach to marine stock enhancement (Blankenship and Leber 1995) was reviewed for four Australian species, and Argyrosomus japonicus and Lates calcarifer were found to be the best candidates for stocking in Australia. Immersion of mulloway in an oxytetracycline-undiluted seawater solution produced poor quality marks, whilst oxytetracycline-diluted seawater solutions and alizarin complexone-seawater solutions produced high quality marks in otoliths and fin spines. These techniques were applied to produce double marks, and in batch mode at fish densities of 30 kg m-3. Key habitats for mulloway were identified as discrete holes or basins up to 20 m deep. Hatchery-reared fish initially had significantly greater movements (greater than 10 km in 3 d) when released in shallow water, compared to hatchery-reared fish released directly over deep holes. Such targeted release strategies could revolutionise stocking of depleted fisheries in estuarine and aquatic habitats, and even oceans. Stomach content analysis of mulloway captured from a coastal lagoon and riverine estuary revealed ontogenetic changes in major prey of mysid shrimp, prawns and forage fish. Comparison between benthic resources and dietary composition in these two estuaries revealed that mulloway consume prey resources in proportion to those in the environment, and do not actively select prey. Simulations of a novel Predatory Impact Model were run for part of the Georges River Recreational Fishing Haven, Sydney, to evaluate appropriate stocking density and associated predatory impact. The 15 km stretch of the Georges River contained c. 361,000 m2 of key mulloway habitat, and 10% of mysid shrimp production within this habitat was assigned to support stocked fish. Given these values, this section of river could support c. 4,000 stocked 8 cm mulloway. Over the 4 y during which mulloway are resident in the estuary, these fish will have a maximum yearly predatory impact of 6.7 t y-1 forage fish, 1.8 t y-1 school prawns and 2.2 t y-1 cephalopods, which represents 48%, 17% and 127% of former commercial fishery in the Georges River respectively.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Estuaries -- Environmental aspects -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Estuaries -- Computer simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polyurethane organosilicate nanocomposites for novel use as biomaterials</field><field name="creator">Styan, Katie, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Polymer organosilicate nanocomposites have attracted significant attention over the last decade due to improved mechanical, thermal, and barrier properties. Several nanocomposite researchers have recognised potential for biomedical applications, however none have conducted biological investigations. In this project, the predicted ability of the organosilicate to enhance biostability, modulate the release of included drugs, and confer biofunctionality and control over the host response, were assessed as the three primary hypotheses. The studies were conducted with the objective being employment as urinary device biomaterials. Of prime importance was that no detrimental change in cytocompatibility was resultant. Biomedical thermoplastic elastomeric polyurethane organosilicate nanocomposites were prepared from poly(ether)urethane of 1000g/mol poly(tetramethylene oxide) polyol, 4,4??? diphenylmethane diisocyanate, and 1,4 butanediol chain extender chemistry, and various organosilicates with loadings from 1w% to 15w%, using a solution casting technique. Initially, partially exfoliated nanocomposites were produced using a commercially available organosilicate, Cloisite?? 30B. These nanocomposites displayed several advantageous properties, namely i) significant anti-bacterial activity, reducing S. epidermidis adherence after 24h to ~20% for a 15w% organosilicate loading, ii) enhanced biostability, with a 15w% organosilicate loading displaying only slight degradation after a 6 week subcutaneous in vivo ovine implantation, and iii) static modulation of model drug release as a factor of drug properties and organosilicate loading. The former was attributed to the Cloisite?? 30B quaternary ammonium compound, while the latter two were likely primarily barrier effect related and due to changes to poly(ether)urethane permeability. Electrostatic and chemical interactivity between drug and organosilicate was also implicated in the observed drug release modulation. Unfortunately, a lack of in vitro cytocompatibility and poor in vivo inflammatory response will limit in vivo use. Utilising bioinert 1-aminoundecanoic acid as an alternative organic modification, cytocompatible intercalated nanocomposites were produced thus likely allowing in vivo nanocomposite use and exploitation of the barrier effect related properties. However, these nanocomposites were not antibacterial. Variation of the organic modification and/or use of co-modification were viable means of modulating host response and biofunctionality, however nanoscale dispersion of co-modified silicate was poor. Use of nanocomposite technology was concluded beneficial to existing biomaterials, and specifically to biomaterial application as urinary catheters / stents.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polymeric composites</field><field name="subject">Biomedical materials</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of cracks on chloride induced corrosion in reinforced concrete flexural members.</field><field name="creator">Adiyastuti, Sri Murti, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The penetration of chloride ions plays a crucial role in reinforcement corrosion and affects the durability and service life of marine structures. The problem is even more acute once cracking occurs in a concrete member. The presence of cracks is shown to have a significant impact on chloride penetration into concrete. It has been recognized, for concrete cracked in flexure, the chloride diffusion coefficient in the tension zone is higher than that in the compression zone. Even a single crack in the tensile zone could contribute to a higher diffusion coefficient compared to that of uncracked members. In this study, the influence of flexural cracks on chloride ion penetration into reinforced concrete beams has been investigated experimentally and a two-dimensional theoretical model is developed. The experimental study investigated the influence of multiple flexural cracks on the chloride diffusivity of reinforced concrete beams and on the corrosion rate of reinforcing bars. The size of the reinforced concrete beams tested is 200 x 250 x 2200 mm with 20mm concrete cover. The beams were pre-cracked using a compression testing machine and the crack widths induced were maintained between 0.1 mm to 0.2 mm. The chloride profile was determined after 1 month, 1 year and 2 years of immersion in 3.0% NaCl solution. The measured chloride profiles of the beams with multiple cracks are compared to those obtained from the uncracked (control) beam. An observation was also made on the effect of cracks on the corrosion development of steel bar after two years of immersion in salt solution. Chloride concentration varied linearly with the depth of crack (at crack planes). A twodimensional model using finite element analysis is developed to evaluate the chloride penetration into cracked concrete. This model was used to verify the chloride penetration data which is obtained from the experimental results. The prediction of chloride ingress, using the two dimensional model agrees well with the short-term and long-term chloride profiles.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chlorides</field><field name="subject">Reinforcing bars -- Corrosion</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31878</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The investigation of novel polymer-photochromic conjugates</field><field name="creator">Such, Georgina, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">My research has focussed on the development of a technique to tailor photochromic switching rates by creating a customised local environment for the dye within an otherwise rigid host matrix. Living radical polymerisation offers the potential to design such a system. A living radical initiator based on a spirooxazine compound was used to polymerise a polymer chain of well controlled molecular weight and polydispersity. This technique facilitated the construction of a conjugate with every photochromic moiety convalently attached to a polymer chain with uniform characteristics. The photochromic behaviour of these new polymer-spirooxazine conjugates were investigated in a cross-linked polymer matrix with a Tg of approximately 120??C. It is well known that photochromic switching is susceptible to local environment effects such as rigidity, free volume and polarity.1, 2 The goal of these systems was to create a uniform local environment which would facilitate controlled changes in the photochromic switching rates. The photophysical investigation of these systems demonstrated the success of this technique. The photochromic rates were directly related to the characteristics of the polymer conjugate. It was postulated the conjugates acted as a customised local environment for the photochromic moiety, encapsulating it from the host matrix. Consequently systematic tailoring of the photochromic switching rates was achieved by changes in the characteristics of the attached polymer. To our knowledge this is the first technique to control local environment of a photochromic compound and thus the first example of systematic tuning of photochromic switching rates. Throughout this research, several characteristics of the attached polymer were modified to give a series of rules for the tuning of photochromic switching rates using this technique.  The largest variation in switching speed is achieved through variation of Tg. A range of photochromic rates from extremely slow to near solution-like can be easily achieved. The necessary variations in Tg can be achieved easily using living radical polymerisation techniques. The use of different homopolymers, block and random copolymers were all demonstrated successfully in this work. For finer tuning of the photochromic rates, changes in chain length can be used. It was also found the best living radical polymerisation method for this work was ATRP due to the bulky or incompatible halogen which contributed to efficient encapsulation. However this endgroup effect is only important in systems which do not have a low Tg component. The incorporation of such a component overrides all other contributions to the overall behaviour.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polymeric composites</field><field name="subject">Photochromic polymers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining the evolutionary sequence of massive star formation</field><field name="creator">Hill, Tracey Lee, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Massive stars form in the dense optically thick cores of molecular clouds throughout the Galaxy. They actively participate in the heating of these molecular clouds and also in enriching the interstellar medium with heavy elements. Stellar winds may contribute to change the original cloud structure by in uencing nearby low mass star formation, or even by triggering the formation of new stars. Despite the fact that massive star formation is manifest throughout the Galaxy, the mechanisms involved in their formation are poorly understood. The coincidence of methanol masers and ultracompact (UC) HII regions with young massive stars, indicates their eectiveness in tracing the earliest stages of high-mass stellar evolution. This thesis concentrates on a multiwavelength study of massive star formation regions. The cornerstone of this thesis is a (sub)millimetre study of methanol maser and UC HII sources associated with massive star formation regions. The 15m Swedish ESO Submillimetre Telescope (SEST) and the 15m James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) were used to survey continuum emission at 1.2mm and 450 &amp; 850 m, respectively. The 1.2-mm continuum emission observations were undertaken with the SEST IMaging Bolometer Array (SIMBA) toward star-forming complexes associated with methanol maser and/or radio continuum sources. This survey detected emission toward all of the methanol maser and UC HII regions targeted, and revealed evidence of a handful of these tracers lying within the elds mapped without millimetre continuum emission. Interestingly, the SIMBA survey also revealed evidence of sources devoid of traditional star formation tracers (methanol/OH maser, UC HII regions, IRAS sources), detected solely from their millimetre continuum emission. These `mm-only' sources prompted a follow-up study with the JCMT. The 450 and 850m observations  of mm-only cores discovered in the SIMBA survey, utilised the Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) on the JCMT, which detected submillimetre continuum emission toward 97 per cent of sources targeted. The SCUBA instrument also resolved a number of SIMBA sources into multiple components, and found evidence of submillimetre sources devoid of SIMBA emission. The (sub)millimetre data from the SIMBA and SCUBA surveys enabled study of the dust properties of the cores, and in particular the dust grain emissivity index , which is of order 2 for the sample. Spectral energy distribution (SED) diagrams were drawn for the SIMBA sources, employing MSX and IRAS data where possible. Eight parameters are reported for each of the sources in the sample: luminosity, temperature, mass, H2 number density (nH2 ), surface density (), radius, distance and luminosity-tomass ratio (L/M). These data show that the mm-only cores are of comparable mass to sources harbouring a methanol maser and/or radio continuum source, but are smaller, cooler, less luminous, with smaller luminosity-to-mass ratios, than these sources. This prompts the suggestion that the mm-only core is an example of the earliest stages of massive star formation prior to the onset of methanol maser emission. The mm-only sample was identied as comprising two populations, which are distinguished by temperature. The cool-mm sources are distinct from the warm-mm sources as well as from those sources with a methanol maser and/or a radio continuum source for all parameters tested but for the mass and in some instances the radius. The warm-mm on the other hand are similar to those sources with a methanol maser site and/or an UC HII region for all parameters tested. The cool-mm sources are less luminous, with lower luminosity-to-mass ratios, as well as higher H2 number and surface densities. This prompts hypotheses to be drawn regarding the nature of these two mm-only populations. The warm-mm sources are possible precursors to the methanol maser and are thus indicative of the earliest stages of massive star formation, whilst the cool-mm sources are possible examples of `failed' cores that will remain starless. It is, however, not yet clear which of these mm-only populations are forming massive stars and further work to test these hypotheses is required.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33373</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework to enforce privacy in business processes</field><field name="creator">Li, Yin Hua, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Service-oriented architectures (SOA), and in particular Web services, have quickly become a popular paradigm to develop distributed applications.  Nowadays, more and more organizations shift their core business to the Web services platform within which various interactions between the autonomous services occur. One of the widely accepted standards in the Web services platform is Business Process Execution Lan- guage for Web Services (BPEL4WS, or BPEL for short). BPEL de&#64257;nes a language to integrate Web services by creating composite Web services in the form of business processes following the service orchestration paradigm, and it enables organizations to focus on core competence and mission-critical operations while outsource every- thing else to reduce costs and time to market.  However BPEL is de&#64257;cient in privacy issues.   The facts are:  (1) service requestors?? personal information is fundamental to enable business processes (e.g., the mortgage approval business process); (2) privacy concerns have become one of the most important issues in Information Technology and has received increasing at- tention from organizations, consumers and legislators; (3) most organizations have recognized that dealing correctly and honestly with customers?? privacy concerns can have bene&#64257;cial returns for their businesses, not only in terms of being compliant with laws and regulations but also in terms of reputation and potential business op- portunities. If not addressed properly, privacy concerns may become an impediment to the widespread adoption of BPEL.  Privacy issues have many aspects, the privacy concerns of potential service re- questor (i.e., client) and the privacy concerns of service provider (i.e., organization) are two of them.   Service requestor speci&#64257;es his/her privacy concerns as privacy preference, while service provider de&#64257;nes and publishes its privacy policy to specify its privacy promises. Before requestor accesses certain service, he/she likes to know whether the service provider will respect his/her privacy preference. Otherwise, the requestor may seek the desired service from somewhere else.  On the other hand,even though most organizations publish their privacy promises, it will be more convincing if customers are assured that such privacy promises are actually kept within the organizations.  In this thesis, we propose a privacy enforcement framework for business processes. In particular, we focus on those that are automated using BPEL. The framework consists of two parts. One focuses on the service requestors?? perspective of privacy, the other concentrates on the privacy concerns of the business process owner (i.e., the service provider). More speci&#64257;cally, the &#64257;rst part of the framework is based on description logic, and allows to represent privacy concepts and perform some rea- soning about these concepts.  The reasoning engine will check requestor??s privacy preference against the service provider??s published privacy promises before the re- questor accesses the desired service.  The second part of the framework facilitates the service provider to enforce its privacy policy within all its business processes throughout the life cycle of personal data. The privacy enforcement can be achieved step by step:  privacy inspection, privacy veri&#64257;cation and privacy obligation man- agement.  The &#64257;rst step, privacy inspection, aims to identify which activity needs the involvement of what personal data. The second step, privacy veri&#64257;cation, is to verify the correctness of designed BPEL business processes in terms of privacy. The third step is to enforce the privacy by managing the ful&#64257;llment of the obligation during the execution of business process.  The  privacy  enforcement  framework  presented  in  the  thesis  has  been  implemented.   The &#64257;rst part of the framework is implemented in the Privacy Match Engine prototype.  For the second part of the framework, as different parts of the privacy policy need to be enforced at different stages of the life cycle of business processes, the implementation consists of a privacy veri&#64257;cation tool and a privacy obligation management system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">business process,</field><field name="subject">privacy protection</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital plan lodgement and dissemination</field><field name="creator">Hobson, Adrian, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In Australia, in recent years there has been increasing demand for more streamlined lodgement of cadastral plans and for their later dissemination. There are a number of approaches to meeting this demand, one of which is developed in detail in this dissertation. The current status of digital lodgement and Digital Cadastral Databases (DCDB) throughout Australia and New Zealand is reviewed. Each of the states and territories in Australia and also New Zealand are examined, looking at the process involved in the lodgement of survey plans and the state of the DCDB in each jurisdiction. From this examination the key issues in digital lodgement and dissemination are extracted and a needs analysis for an Australia-wide generic system is carried out. This needs analysis is directed at technological change allied with sound cadastral principles. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is considered for the storage and transport of all the required data and to facilitate the dissemination of information over the Internet. The benefits of using XML are comprehensive, leading to its selection and the use of related technologies LandXML, Extensible Structured Query Language (XSQL) and Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL). Vector graphics are introduced as the means to display plans and maps on the Internet. A number of vector standards and Web mapping solutions are compared to determine the most suitable for this project. A new standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), is chosen. A prototype Web interface and the underlying database and Web server were developed using Oracle as the database and Apache as the Web server. Each aspect of the development is described, starting with the installation and configuration of the database, the Web server and the XSQL servlet. Testing was undertaken using LandXML cadastral data and displaying plans using SVG. Both Internet Explorer and Mozilla were trialled as the Web browser, with Mozilla  being chosen because of incompatibilities between Internet Explorer, LandXML and SVG. An operational pilot was created. At this stage it requires manual intervention to centre and maximise a plan in the display area. The result indicates that an automated system is feasible and this dissertation provides a basis for further development by Australian land administration organisations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Digital mapping</field><field name="subject">Image processing - Digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Geometry - Data processing</field><field name="subject">Surveying - Computer programs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of in vitro toxicity methods for fire combustion products</field><field name="creator">Lestari, Fatma, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A large range of polymers are used in building and mass transport interiors which released more toxic products during combustion. This work explores the cytotoxicity of selected chemicals and smoke derived from materials combustion. A selection of polymers and fiberglass reinforced polymer (FRP) composites used in building and railway carriage interiors including: polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), melamine plywood, and two FRPs were studied. A small scale laboratory fire test using a vertical tube furnace was designed for the generation of combustion products. The volatile organic compounds were identified using ATD-GCMS (Automatic Thermal Desorption-Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry). The in vitro techniques were developed for human cells exposure to fire effluents including the indirect (impinger) and direct (air/liquid interface using Harvard Navicyte Chamber) exposure. Cytotoxic effects were assessed based on cell viability using a range of in vitro assays. Human skin tissue was also used as preliminary study to assess the toxic effects at the tissue level. A minor change in the cellular function of the skin from the exposure of PMMA combustion products was observed. The combustion study was conducted under different burning stage of fire: non-flaming and flaming combustion. Results suggested that PVC was the most toxic material for both non-flaming (IC50 1.24 mg/L) and flaming combustion (IC50 1.99 mg/L). The degree of toxicity generated depends on the fire stage: non-flaming or flaming combustion. Some materials revealed to be more toxic under flaming combustion (PP, PC, FRPs), whilst others (PVC, PMMA, PE, and melamine plywood) appear to be more toxic under non-flaming combustion. A strong correlation was shown between the change in toxicity as measured by IC50 and TLC and the change in concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulates. A comparison between in vitro data versus published in vivo combustion data indicated the in vitro results to be more sensitive than animal toxicity data. The outcome of this study has the potential for an alternative method to current fire toxicity standard, whilst providing more accurate toxicity information for fire safety professionals, materials manufacturer, building designers and consumer safety data.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Combustion</field><field name="subject">Toxicity testing -- In vitro</field><field name="subject">Fire</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systematic study of self-repairs in second language classroom presentations: with some reference to social variables and language proficiency</field><field name="creator">Kazemi, Ali, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">Self-repairs have been the subject of investigation in a number of research areas, notably psycholinguistics and conversation analysis. This study has aimed at the examination of self-repairs in second language classroom presentations. Specifically, it has sought to gain insight into self-repairs in naturally occurring talk and to explicate the possible relationships between the variables of age, sex, and educational background and self-repair behaviour of L2 speakers as well as the possible link between self-repair and proficiency. Accomplishing these required a scrutiny of individual self-repairs and their classification. However, the classifications which have traditionally been used in the psycholinguistic approach suffer from a number of shortcomings, as they are usually based on the analysis of surface forms of self-repairs. Because of the subjectivity involved in this process, there has been considerable variation in terms of classes of self-repairs and also the decision as to where a given self-repair belongs. An in-depth analysis of self-repair data revealed that self-repairs do cluster into categories. This analysis also yielded a set of features which are relevant to the study of self-repairs. In addition to showing that the established categories are mutually exclusive, comparison of major categories of self-repairs according to these features, which characterise the trajectory of self-repairs, resulted in the explication of a number of regularities in the way L2 speakers carry out self-repairs. Having established a data-driven classification of repairs, an attempt was made to see whether learner variables of age, sex and educational background have any significant effect on self-repairs. It turned out that none of these variables have a significant effect on self-repairs. In addition, it became clear that while beginning, intermediate, and advanced L2 speakers have been shown to demonstrate significant proficiency-related differences, these differences fade away when they come from the same proficiency level.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">English language -- Study and teaching -- Australia -- Foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">Communication in foreign language education</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24298</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring gifted primary students' perceptions of the characteristics of their effective teachers.</field><field name="creator">Hor, Su-yin, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study sought to explore the question of what personal and professional characteristics may be particularly relevant to effective teachers of the gifted, by investigating the characteristics of effective teachers identified in both the general teacher effectiveness literature and the gifted education literature, through the perceptions of gifted primary students about teachers they regarded as effective. A questionnaire was created for this study, comprised of items which represented characteristics identified from the literature review and determined to be relevant to students' experiences. This questionnaire was distributed to the sample of intellectually gifted primary students (n = 168), and their responses were examined for differences between moderately gifted (n = 74) and highly gifted primary students (n = 94), as well as female (n = 84) and male (n = 81) gifted primary students. This study also recorded gifted primary students' opinions regarding what they believe were the characteristics that made their nominated teachers so effective, through the use of an open-ended question in the questionnaire. This study found that the characteristics of effective teachers identified in both the general teacher effectiveness and the gifted education literatures were supported by gifted primary students' perceptions of their nominated teachers. This study also found differences between moderately gifted and highly gifted primary students, as well as gender differences on a number of characteristics. These differences support the need to examine, more carefully, teacher behaviour and strategies in the classroom for differences in how they may influence the learning of students of different levels of ability and gender. A qualitative analysis of gifted primary students' answers to the open-ended question also revealed in-depth information about how teachers' characteristics are related to each other, and how students perceive them to be effective, as well as suggesting characteristics that were not identified in the previous review of the literature.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Primary schools -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Gifted children -- Education</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying environmental risk of groundwater contaminated with volatile chlorinated hydrocarbons</field><field name="creator">Hunt, James</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">groundwater contamination</field><field name="subject">envrionmental risks</field><field name="subject">chlorinated hydrocarbons</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A quantitative model for measuring technology transfer potentials at the industrial level - an application towards establishing technology cooperation</field><field name="creator">Jayaraman, Veerappan</field><field name="description">International transfer of technology is the key element for the industrialisation and economic development of countries. But the success of any transfer depends on the judicious selection of appropriate technology from the right source and its effective absorption. This depends to a large extent on the selection, adaptation and assimilation capabilities of the recipient of the technology. In technology transfer, adaptation at the transferee end is an important stage. The difference between the technology levels of the transferor and transferee causes a technological gap which creates a potential for technology flow, but the transfer will depend on the assimilating capability of the transferee. In this study, a mathematical function that determines the technological level of a country is developed using the logistic growth pattern. The technological level of a country, in a given industry, is measured by an indicator called 'Technology Index' using the variables that influence and reflect the performance of that industry. The technology index is computed using the factor loadings obtained by the statistical technique factor analysis. In technology transfer, one of the most important problems facing countries is the selection of a transferor. Using the classical optimisation method, optimum transferors for various hypothetical transferees are determined in order to study the optimal partnership in technology transfer. A theoretical framework is provided for technological cooperation among the member countries of APEC based on the technology transfer model and classical optimisation method developed in this study. The theoretical framework can be applied to establish, for each industry, a technology cooperation network among the member countries by identifying the optimum partnership, that will provide an effective technology transfer process.

It investigates historically the emergence of fear of crime as a set of discourses in the human sciences and in government and explores the ways in which these various institutions have imagined the subjects of their inquiries. It also discusses the ways in which fear of crime has become a discourse within popular culture and the mass media, and explores why gender is a potent signifier in fear of crime research.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">criminology</field><field name="subject">victimology</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">crime prevention</field><field name="subject">policing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/186</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Amechan : the creation and packaging of identity</field><field name="creator">Ramsay, Lehan</field><field name="description">This paper and the accompanying project Amechan explore the construction of 'virtual' identity on the Internet. It explores historic art trails and how they lead to the new frontier of web art, moving from the traditional arts to television, video to the Internet. It explores the need for alternative forms of art practice and art dissemination in contemporary society and it looks at what makes web art unique. It also explores the alternate realms of reality; our physical world, and the new world of the virtual. And how this has affected our notions of self, privacy, and narrative. And finally, it explains the construction of the Amechan site, both theoretically and practically. The paper has been divided into three parts. The first sites the work within current art practices. The second places Amechan into the context of the author's art practice. The third section looks at the elements and themes contained within the Amechan site, which was a serialized 'homepage' created by a fictional character, a diaristic narrative of image and text. The site initially ran from February 1-July 31, 1999. The section also discusses the ideas that have informed the site in less discernible ways. It looks at the theoretical and practical concerns of creating and maintaining the site for the 6 months it was initially operating, and at the site as 'installation'. It also introduces an email correspondence between the fictional character of 'Amechan' and an unknown correspondent.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">virtual</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">web image</field><field name="subject">video image</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antimicrobial metabolites from Australian Acacia</field><field name="creator">Ali, Marina</field><field name="description">As part of an investigation into traditional Australian Aboriginal bush medicine a range of Acacia species have been examined.

Initial bioactivity screening focussed on antimicrobial activity of the polar/and or non-polar extracts of air dried plant material, and a range of interesting activity has been found. Specifically, of the 94 extracts of Acacia species screened, five showed activity against the fungus C.albicans, 47 showed activity showed activity against the gram positive bacteria S.aureus and five showed activity against the gram negative bacteria E.coli. A retrosynthetic analysis and total synthesis of the novel anisidine alkaloid isolated from Acacia trineura was attempted.

These reforms were instigated by a perceived change in Australia&#8217;s international competitiveness and an overall lack of flexibility that hindered productivity and technological advancements. This thesis draws upon research into the changes in VET policy and the implications for management strategy within the retail industry. It discusses the key elements of the contemporary VET system and outlines the nature and introduction of the National Training Package in Retail. Evidence from case study research into three large Australian retail organisations is presented as a means of contrasting employer experiences in the implementation of retail traineeships. The case studies highlight the different ways the same structural system can be adapted and utilised across different organisations with various degrees of success. In analysing the changes in VET policy and the implications for management strategy in the retail industry it is evident that the outcomes of implementing traineeships will be reliant on the strategic choices made by the employers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">retail trade</field><field name="subject">employees</field><field name="subject">occupational training</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">traineeships</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/12774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and use of SSR markers for genetic population structure analysis of Pisolithus</field><field name="creator">Hitchcock, Catherine J.</field><field name="description">Pisolithus is an ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal genus that exists in native and plantation forests worldwide. Despite many aspects of the genus having been studied over the years, there is limited knowledge of the genetic population structure of Pisolithus spp. The major aim of this study was to begin to elucidate the genetic structure of populations of Pisolithus native to the eastern states of Australia. Initially, the number of species represented in the University of Western Sydney Pisolithus culture collection was investigated using ITS-RFLP and previously developed simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. From these analyses, two clear groupings emerged with the RFLP groups corresponding to the SSR groups identified. To study genetic population structure, appropriate markers were required and SSR markers were considered to be most suited to this end. The developed SSR markers were successfully used to amplify P. microcarpus and P. albus DNA from ECM root tips and soil samples. Therefore, these markers will be a useful tool for future investigations into the population structure of above and below-ground structures of P. microcarpus and P. albus populations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pisolithus</field><field name="subject">fungi</field><field name="subject">Ectomycorrhizal fungi</field><field name="subject">SSR markers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/13624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Domain-specificity between types of peer support and multidimensional self-concept</field><field name="creator">Leung, Charles K. C.</field><field name="description">The primary purpose of the present investigation was to capitalise on recent advances in peer support and self-concept research to rigorously test the impact of different types of peer support interventions on multiple dimensions of self-concept and peer support by employing a construct validityapproach to the study of intervention effects. More specifically, the research aimed to: (1) conduct a meta-analysis to synthesise and critically analyse the current research literature, to elucidate the impact of academically&#8211;orientated peer tutoring interventions on tutees&#8217; academic outcomes and self-concepts; (2) identify psychometrically sound self-concept and social support instruments for use with evaluating secondary school peer support interventions; and (3) test the impact of researcher-devised academically-orientated and socially-orientated peer support interventions administered to Australian and Chinese students on specific facets of self-concept and perceived peer support. The findings have important implications that peer support interventions have the potential to make a significant contribution to schools&#8217; efforts to orchestrate positive academic and social outcomes in multiple domains of self-concept and peer support. The results also support the usefulness of employing a construct validity approach to the study of intervention effects and the self-concept theory and research on which this is based. They advance our understanding of the factor structure of self-concept for Chinese and Australian secondary students; the differential positive impact of academically-orientated and socially-orientated peer support interventions on self-concept; and provide strong empirical evidence to identify features of peer support intervention design that will produce optimal effectiveness and therefore serve to inform theory, research, and practice.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">group guidance in education</field><field name="subject">peer counseling</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">identification (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">youth</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/13912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing effective implementation and adoption of web information system applications based on adoption theories.</field><field name="creator">Hansen, Stephen</field><field name="description">As more and more of information systems develop into large scale web applications, the complexity of multiple possible stakeholders and users multiplies. Web engineering methodologies although developing, are still primarily addressing the technical and functional issues in these large systems. The thesis addresses the web information system development from a social-psychological viewpoint to find ways to better match the user with system development. This thesis proposes a methodology to apply adoption theory into web application development. The hypothesis being that this is another way to enhance the utilisation of the system by the users. A thorough review of both adoption theory and adoption models showed that existing models are more descriptive of the process than applicational. From a wide range of adoption models, the thesis synthesised a composite adoption model, based on an accepted descriptive framework by Rogers. This was done by mapping to this foundation framework relevant criteria and procedures from significant adoption models. Along with this composite adoption model was also developed a development procedure that mapped the adoption model to common activities found in all the web and software engineering processes, giving a formal mechanism to apply the adoption theory to a wide range of web development methodologies. In doing so the composite model introduces a new dimension into the domain analysis by identifying a new class of stakeholders, namely &#8220;adoption change agents&#8221;, and also broadens the requirements process. The adoption model and development process was then applied to the development of a substantive web information system called Platform Web. Platform Web over a three year period evolved to provide many integrated online functions, including a fully developed teaching package only available on one member, to a university wide online tutorial system that integrated to the student administrative systems, the timetabling and teaching module. As the university at that time consisted of three basically independent network members, each promoting the use of web based teaching, it was possible to run a series of statistical tests across the three members on the uptake of their respective web application teaching modules. The significant statistical results endorsing the thesis hypothesis that &#8220;Adoption modelling will enhance the effective use of web applications and the resulting web information systems if applied at the web application design level and also in the formulation of system implementation strategies, management models and system evolution methodologies.&#8221;</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">structured programming</field><field name="subject">database design</field><field name="subject">data processing in education</field><field name="subject">information storage and retrieval systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/14139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New mothers creating their well-being: a hermeneutic study</field><field name="creator">Cole, Rose</field><field name="description">This hermeneutic study explores the experience of well-being of eight new mothers who live in the Blue Mountains of N.S.W.

Social support is integral to this. The study is grounded in hermeneutics incorporating the Heideggerian ideas of being-in-the-world, co-constitution and the hermeneutic circle and also the Gadamerian idea of fusion of horizons.

An unnatural split between thinking and feeling is seen to be entrenched in society and to be a cause for conflict. It is argued that this split has its origins in the individual 's unresolved inner conflict of ego and shadow. The idea of the archetype is examined in the context of Jung's observations about psychic features which he made throughout his lifetime. While it is true the psychic archetypes have an immense significance for a society in general, it is also true that archetypes are absolutely central in the life of the individual. The central part played by mythology and fairy tale in Jungian psychology is explored using a North American Indian myth as a vehicle for an exposition for some major concepts. Inheritance of archetypes is perhaps the central feature of controversy surrounding the Jungian concept of psychic archetypes and a possible mechanism of inheritance based on the idea of the 'meme' and its relationship to the gene, is examined. The ancient story of Aladdin and the Lamp, is found to contain inherent psychic features or artefacts, which elucidate the concept of the ego/shadow polarity, and so can be seen to constitute an example of an 'archaeology' of archetypes. The apparent dual nature of the archetype is further explored by comparing and contrasting the archetypes of the 'wise old man' and the 'wicked magician', and this dual nature exploration is seen to be in essence an examination of the ego/shadow equilibrium, which exerts its influence on all manifestations at the moment of expression. This unexpected influence on the archetype, despite the archetype's collective nature, explains the positive and negative faces of the archetypes and seems to resolve some questions about their moral, amoral and/or polar nature. The resolution of psychic conflict in the context of Jungian individuation and how the individuation process may influence the expression of collective features, is also found to have the ego/shadow equilibrium as the central psychic structure.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polarity</field><field name="subject">archetype</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">Jungian psychology</field><field name="subject">Jung, C.

This thesis suggests seven criteria for assessing the early Soviet legal debates: 1/. Broad ranging legal debates 2/ The social and historical context 3/. The legal record of Soviet Russia 4/. The socialist opposition 5/. Classical Marxist legal theory 6/. The axis of the early debates 7/. The contrast with Stalinism. An introduction explains the parameters of the thesis. Chapter 1 examines the classical Marxist theory of law and the state. Chapters 2 and 3 review the revolution&#8217;s context: the pre-1917 legal record and the political physiognomy and dynamics of the 1917 revolution. Chapters 4 and 5 probe the legal record of early Soviet Russia, and Lenin&#8217;s views on law. Chapter 6 reviews the legal debates, while chapters 7 and 8 focus on the particular contributions of Stuchka and Pashukanis. Chapter 9 examines the impact of the Socialist opposition, most notably the Left Opposition formed by Leon Trotsky at the end of 1923.

In the Australian nursing context, bullying is reported as a common form of aggression. While acknowledged as a concerning issue, there is little substantive data on the meaning of bullying or how it affects the private or professional lives of Australian nurses. The aim of this study was to address this gap by investigating the nature, extent and consequences of bullying in the Australian nursing workplace. A three-stage sequential mixed method design was adopted for the study. The first stage involved in-depth, semi-structured, qualitative interviews with 26 nurses with experience of workplace bullying. Content analysis of the interview transcripts using the NVivo software program identified four major categories, and a number of minor categories and sub-categories. These categories formed the basis of a survey instrument developed for use in the second stage of the study. The second stage of the study established the validity, reliability and factor structure of the newly developed instrument. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software identified seven coherent latent factors, which underpinned the experience, consequences, and organisational features associated with workplace bullying. The EFA identified reliable measures of the seven latent factors and two scales were refined entitled the Bullying Acts and Consequences Scale and the Organisational Processes Scale. The third stage of the study employed the survey instrument validated in the previous stage of the study with a cross-sectional randomised sample of the Australian nursing workforce. Analysis of the survey data identified that bullying occurred across all sectors of the nursing workforce, with no correlations between experiencing bullying and demographic and employment characteristics. In addition to describing the nature, extent and consequences of bullying, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used on the data from the national survey to further refine the scales developed in the previous stage of the study. These two scales were refined into one multidimensional scale entitled the Organisational Predictors and Consequences of Bullying Scale (OPCBS). The final step in the analysis of the national survey data involved structural equation modeling (SEM) using the AMOS software program. The modeling established that the four organisational factors measured in the study were associated with bullying and the measured consequences. The significant contributions of this study include the finding that organisational features rather than individual characteristics influence the experience of bullying in the nursing workplace, and the development of valid and reliable measures of bullying behaviours, associated organisational features and the consequences of bullying.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bullying in the workplace</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">job stress</field><field name="subject">professional relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/33181</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Image Stammers</field><field name="creator">Victor, Suzann</field><field name="description">Bodies, burdened with narratives and inscribed by laws, function as signifiers of the State propaganda and nationalisms that supercede the Individual. The Image Stammers discredits the seamless fusion of the body-politic of the Singapore state with that of the Individual. This paper looks at the State as its singular source of artistic stimulation and seeks to dislodge the ventriloquised voice of that State acting upon the art object and its producer, so as to liberate the image from the singular meaning the State imposes. To do this, the analysis in this paper intervenes in the State and its organ, the media, in their attempt to imprison the reality of the performance image so as to reverse the silence that has been demanded of the artist. By reinstating this voice into the visual work the author has produced in this text, based on theories of 'internalised' Orientalism discussed by Geraldine Heng and Janadas Devan, as well as notions of abjections in the work of Elizabeth Grosz anfd Julia Kristeva, this paper attempts to strip the State of its veneer of 'purity' to expose an underside that subjects female bodies to forms of nationalism which are now more codified than ever. This paper foregrounds textual and visual embodiment as a testimony of lived experience which may further entrench, notions of Singapore as an authoritarian state. The Image Stammers bears no pretension of objectivity nor a 'politically safe and correct' one within the context of this paper, but instead, strewns fragments of subjectivity throughout its textual landscape. It seeks to overturn the 'impurity' of the abject (signified by performance art and contemporary artists) as defined, loathed and expelled by the State, into the power of resistance and maintenance of the integrity of the Individual. The Image Stammers retrieves the abject as markers of the limits of State power to become signifiers of resistance for its reconstitution into allies of the artist</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">art and state (Singapore)</field><field name="subject">installations (art) Singapore</field><field name="subject">modern art (20th century)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performing the Singapore state 1988-1995</field><field name="creator">Langenbach, Ray</field><field name="description">This dissertation explores performances in Singapore as indicators of divergent visions of the nation-state. To understand the ways in which the government and artists contested (or, in some cases, agreed to not contest) the cultural ground requires an examination of performance as a semiotic mode in public life, a genre in art, and an instrument of cultural politics. A study of performance alone cannot sufficiently reveal the subtleties of governmental and artistic agency. The government and artists have mobilized specific figures of speech from a repertoire developed over centuries.These tropes are analysed for their uses, their performative instrumentality, and their discursive power. Tropes and performances coalesce and disseminate prevailing national, regional,and global ideologies. This study examines the power of aesthetic forms, and the aesthetics of power. Competing notions of performance in Singapore led to a cultural crisis in 1993-94.

Problem-solving approaches to teaching mathematics have been recommended in curriculum documents for some time but there is evidence to suggest that there has been limited classroom implementation both in Australia as well as overseas. This investigation explored the level of implementation of mathematical problem solving in primary classrooms in NSW. Teachers' beliefs about the role of problem solving in learning mathematics as well as their classroom practices were also investigated. To explore what teachers believe and what they do in relation to problem solving, this investigation examined primary school teachers' reported beliefs about the role of problem solving in learning mathematics and their reported practices in classrooms. It aimed to discover how beliefs about mathematical problem solving influenced decision making in teachers' classrooms and what factors promoted and hindered the implementation of problem-solving approaches. The results of this investigation could provide benefits to several different groups involved in mathematics education. Preservice teacher educators and presenters of inservice education courses could benefit from increased knowledge about the role of beliefs in determining practices as well as potential constraints on desirable practices. Associated with this may be the need to challenge teachers' beliefs that might not support the development of practices that promote problem-solving approaches. For practising teachers, professional development could focus on examining their beliefs and providing the necessary support for teachers to realise the aim of assisting their pupils to achieve problem-solving competence. Curriculum developers may benefit from an increased awareness of the difficulties associated with implementing recommended approaches. Finally, participating teachers may benefit from their involvement in the investigation through opportunities to reflect on their practice while completing the survey instrument as well as during interview discussions with the researcher. Scope. Data collection focused on teachers' beliefs about mathematics, teaching mathematics and learning mathematics, as well as on their reported practices since all of these factors impact on what occurs in teachers' classrooms. A combination of methods was used to collect data so that there was increased confidence in the research findings. In this way, the results of one method could be tested against another for consistency, thus enhancing trustworthiness and dependability. The data collection for this investigation was divided into two phases. The first phase involved the use of a questionnaire to seek data on teachers' reported problem solving beliefs and practices as little is known overall in this area, particularly within the context of Australian teachers. Responses were received from 162 primary school teachers currently teaching in NSW. The instrument was designed with reference to similar instruments that had been used by other researchers in the field and incorporated a combination of closed and open questions. The second phase of data collection incorporated interviews and observations that were conducted in the field. These methods were used to explore the problem-solving teaching approaches used by a small number of teachers in particular school settings. To collect data about teachers' planning for instruction, and opportunities that support or constrain innovative practices, it was more appropriate to explore particular contexts that would provide a rich set of data. Conclusions. Analyses of data confirmed the spread of teachers' beliefs, the diversity of their practice, and revealed issues that could hinder their problem-solving efforts in classrooms. A small group of surveyed teachers reported holding very traditional views that were quite distinct from another group who reported support for very contemporary views. These differences were also apparent in relation to reported classroom practices and appeared to be linked to the current teaching grade level of the respondents. This was confirmed during the interviews and observations as it seems easier for teachers of the lower primary grades to implement practices identified as supporting problem-solving approaches. For teachers of upper primary grades, parents' and school expectations impinge on teachers' practices and potentially constrain their problem-solving efforts. For the two teachers who participated in the classroom observations, considerable energy was required to resist constraints and implement problem-solving approaches. Recommendations for practice and future research include the need for an examination of constraints on practice, the role of reflective practice in implementing innovative practices, the viability of teaching through problem solving as a necessary and important teaching approach, and the use of a variety of problem types in preparing students to be successful problem solvers. In addition, teachers may need to be encouraged to continually reflect on practice and teacher educators may need to raise the awareness of preservice and inservice teachers to the issues involved in implementing problem-solving approaches in their classrooms.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Primary school teachers</field><field name="subject">Problem solving</field><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp198.01072009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Dialogue of Theology and Education: Clarifying the role of Lutheran confessional theology for Australian Lutheran school education</field><field name="creator">Bartsch, Malcolm Ian</field><field name="description">Aim: This study aims to clarify the role of Lutheran confessional theology in informing and shaping policy and practice for Australian Lutheran school education. In doing this, it also seeks to provide another step in the on-going process of developing for Australian Lutheran schools a comprehensive theoretical framework that reflects insights from both Lutheran confessional theology and educational theory and research. Scope: The thesis begins with the presupposition that education is a value-laden process and that schools need shared beliefs and values to function effectively. In the current scenario of change in society in general and in education in particular, such a common vision is difficult to maintain. However, Australian Lutheran schools begin with theology as the starting point for their value base. This means that they can share a common vision drawn from God's revelation in Scripture. However, this theology needs to be expressed in such a way that it can be brought into dialogue with educational theory and research in order to develop insights relevant for determining the nature and purpose of Australian Lutheran schools. Since Lutheran theology sees itself as 'confessional' in nature, and since the Lutheran Church defines itself in relation to its confessional writings, the Book of Concord (1580) is taken as the theological basis for this thesis. While the Book of Concord could be seen as containing documents from a different era, nevertheless it is still the accepted theological basis of Lutheranism and any attempt to provide a theoretical framework for Australian Lutheran schools would need to be consistent with its theology. Before examining the theology of the Book of Concord, the study briefly traces the development of Lutheran schools in Australia and the aims and purposes for which they were established. The role of theology in motivating the establishment of those schools is also considered. The rapid expansion of Australian Lutheran schools during the past three decades is then investigated for the purpose of identifying current issues faced by these schools which need to be addressed through insights from Lutheran confessional theology. The study then turns to the Book of Concord in order to summarise major emphases of Lutheran confessional theology. This is done to identify critical Lutheran theological perspectives which need to be brought into dialogue with the educational challenges faced by Australian Lutheran schools in the current context of rapid social, cultural and educational changes. The central teaching of the Book of Concord, the doctrine of justification by grace through faith on account of Christ, is examined first. This is followed by theology of the cross, law and gospel, the perspective of the 'two kingdoms' and the individual as saint and sinner. Throughout this process, the dialectic nature of Lutheran confessional theology is emphasised. In bringing these major teachings of the Book of Concord into dialogue with the educational issues identified earlier in the thesis, a number of implications are developed for Australian Lutheran school education. In particular, the Australian Lutheran school is considered as a 'confessional community' and examined from the perspective of the 'two kingdoms'. Other educational issues are explored, including Lutheran anthropology of the individual, the place of the Bible in Lutheran schools, the role of the law in Lutheran schools and the implications of 'theology of the cross' for life in the church and the world. Conclusions: In attempting to clarify the role of Lutheran confessional theology for Australian Lutheran school education this study deduces that theology and education exist in a process of 'dialectic dialogue' with each other, 'listening to each other' but also retaining certain levels of dialectic tension as each side responds to the other. However, this study also emphasises the dialectic nature of Lutheran confessional theology which must be preserved in order to avoid the danger that only one side of the theological tension will be considered in the dialogue with education. Thus this study concludes that if Lutheran confessional theology is to play its vital role in developing a comprehensive theoretical framework for Australian Lutheran school education, then a 'double dialectic' needs to be maintained - the dialectic tension within Lutheran confessional theology in dialectic dialogue with educational theory and practice.

The purpose was to propose guiding principles that could inform a review of Year 12 religious education curriculum in Catholic schools. There were two broad areas of investigation to this study: the theory and the practice of religious education in Catholic schools, with special attention given to the Year 12 programs. With the first area, there was an examination of religious education theory as revealed in the literature. This was concerned with the nature and purpose of religious education in Catholic schools. Different approaches to religious education were explored and their strengths and weaknesses for senior secondary programs were highlighted. In addition, recent approaches to teaching and learning at the broader curriculum level were investigated to highlight possible relevance to religious education. Thirdly, the theory of and approaches to religious education were considered in relation to some aspects of the context of contemporary classrooms. The second area was an investigation into current practices in the compulsory or core Year 12 religious education programs since these were accessed by all or most students in Catholic schools. Eleven schools were involved in the study. They were drawn from the four dioceses in Victoria and were chosen because they displayed certain characteristics which were seen as representative of the wider range of Catholic schools. In order to gain an insight into classroom practices, three sources of data were collected from these schools and examined. Firstly, through the use of questionnaires and interviews, data was collected on students' perceptions of their experiences in their religious education program. Secondly, questionnaires were used to gather information on the teachers' experiences of the program, their perceptions of their students' experiences and their background in religious education. Teachers' perceptions were used as a point of comparison with students' perceptions. Thirdly, religious education documents were examined and analysed to discover their aims and objectives, the content and topics included and their assessment strategies. In general, the various approaches (in terms of content and method) to Year 12 religious education classroom programs in Catholic schools in Victoria either emphasized cognitive learning or it focused on affective learning. With the former, an intellectual study of religion through a study of different religious traditions was offered which, it was hoped, would lead to an increased understanding and appreciation of the subject. With the latter, more attention was given to the personal dimension in religious education in terms of interpersonal and intrapersonal learning. The findings of this research study indicated that, in the perceptions of a majority of students, the religious education programs were not meeting their needs. This raises the question of the pertinence of the aims for senior secondary religious education as proposed in curriculum guidelines for Catholic schools in Victoria. The findings, therefore, suggest a need for a review of such programs in Catholic schools. The study concluded with the proposal of thirteen guiding principles that could inform the development, implementation and evaluation of future Year 12 religious education programs in Catholic schools. The principles, drawn from key insights from both the theory and current practice of religious education, could have relevance for Catholic school administrators, policy makers and religious education teachers. In addition, other areas were identified which could be useful for further investigation to enhance existing knowledge in this field of study.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Religious education</field><field name="subject">Secondary Catholic schools</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp201.02072009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collaboration and the Use of Online Collaborative Toolsets in the Project Management Environment</field><field name="creator">Harley, James</field><field name="description">The research aims to develop an understanding of the extent to which collaboration occurs through the use of online technologies in the project management environment.  Given the breadth of the technological landscape, this research focuses on the use of online collaborative toolsets (OCTs).      The research investigates six Project Management Environments (PMEs) and their use of OCTs, and uses a Collaboration scale developed specifically to measure the level of collaboration existing within each PME.  The Collaboration scale presents collaboration not as a single entity, but as a scale ranging from low to high across six elements.  Central to this theory is that for collaboration to exist, all elements must rate highly against the scale.  The research argues that although all collaborative elements are found within a PME, it is the level of each element that determines the degree to which collaboration is occurring.      A case study approach incorporated three broad strategies to collect data.  The first strategy included a Likert questionnaire using the Dichotomous scale, which was administered to collect data on the operations of the individual projects.  The second strategy included interviews that asked the project manager of each case specific questions regarding the PME.  The third strategy involved desk research to scan for literature and web artefacts.      The conclusions drawn from this research are:      1.	OCTs can contain a variety of features, several of which are common amongst all.  The research identified common requirements and use of the OCTs within the cases.   2.	Although OCTs are capable of facilitating a high level of collaboration, Project Managers do not use OCTs for this purpose.  The different project environments reviewed are not necessarily collaborative, nor do they use OCTs to assist with collaborative exercises.   3.	OCTs are used predominantly for cooperation and coordinating activities within the PME.   4.	Collaboration in the PMEs reviewed exists in degrees, at times being identified with cooperative functions, and at other times coordinating functions.     5.	The findings demonstrate a pattern of collaboration, which is consistent across all cases.  This pattern demonstrates a variation in the collaborative elements across the PME, and indicates a priority that may exist in regard to how these elements are prescribed within the actual project environment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Online collaborative toolsets</field><field name="subject">collaboration scale</field><field name="subject">project management environment</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090625.112400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coping with cultural differences : &#135;b the development of generic capabilities in logistics graduates</field><field name="creator">Christopherson, Geoffrey John</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates development of generic capabilities in an RMIT undergraduate logistics degree program. Generic capabilities are those general graduate attributes that are not specifically discipline-focused, examples being communication and teamwork skills.   A major research objective of this thesis is the extent to which graduates perceived that generic capabilities were developed in their RMIT logistics undergraduate program, specifically in a cross-cultural context spanning a range of organisations differing in size and ownership structure.   The thesis involves two studies. In Study 1 managers from eight organisations, ranging in size from multi-national to small public and private (family-owned) companies were interviewed to develop a series of qualitative organisational case studies using grounded theory methodology. Study 2 is a quantitative survey of 31 Australian and 25 Asian (Singapore and Hong Kong) logistic graduates from 1996 to 2002.   In Study 1, generic capabilities rankings in different organisations varied, depending on whether managers being interviewed were operational or human resource management specialists, but there was general agreement that communication, problem-solving, initiative and enterprise, and teamwork skills were highest priority. Study 2 results indicate that the views of both Asian and Australian graduates are in line with the management rankings, and are consistent with those reported by Australian and OECD government and industry research organisations. Both graduate groups agree that generic capabilities are covered in the RMIT logistic program, but ratings are generally in an 'adequate' to 'good' range, with no outstanding features. Although cultural diversity in the student body is seen as a major benefit, there are little data indicating a high level of Australian and Asian student networking, and a number of respondents are critical of a lack of international focus in the present program. A major issue is a n eed for more emphasis on presentation and problem-solving skills so graduates are able to carry through a project from initiation to completion.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">generic capabilities</field><field name="subject">cross cultural management</field><field name="subject">organisational management</field><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="subject">knowledge management</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090625.102224</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fractal features of Surface Electromyogram: A new measure for low level muscle activation</field><field name="creator">Poosapadi Arjunan, Sridhar</field><field name="description">Identifying finger and wrist flexion based actions using single channel surface electromyogram have a number of rehabilitation, defence and human computer interface applications. These applications are currently infeasible because of unreliability in classification of sEMG when the level of muscle contraction is low and when there are multiple active muscles. The presence of noise and cross-talk from closely located and simultaneously active muscles is exaggerated when muscles are weakly active such as during maintained wrist and finger flexion. It has been established in literature that surface electromyogram (sEMG) and other such biosignals are fractal signals. Some researchers have determined that fractal dimension (FD) is related to strength of muscle contraction. On careful analysis of fractal properties of sEMG, this research work has established that FD is related to the muscle size and complexity and not to the strength of muscle contraction.   The work has also identified a novel feature, maximum fractal length (MFL) of the signal, as a good measure of strength of contraction of the muscle. From the analysis, it is observed that while at high level of contraction, root mean square (RMS) is an indicator of strength of contraction of the muscle, this relationship is not very strong when the muscle contraction is less than 50% maximum voluntary contraction.   This work has established that MFL is a more reliable measure of strength of contraction compared to RMS, especially at low levels of contraction. This research work reports the use of fractal properties of sEMG to identify the small changes in strength of muscle contraction and the location of the active muscles. It is observed that fractal dimension (FD) of the signal is related with the properties of the muscle while maximum fractal length (MFL) is related to the strength of contraction of the associated muscle. The results show that classifying MFL and FD of a single channel sEMG from the forearm it is possible to accurately identify a set of finger and wrist flexion based actions even when the muscle activity is very weak. It is proposed that such a system could be used to control a prosthetic hand or for human computer interface.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surface Electromyogram</field><field name="subject">Fractal</field><field name="subject">low level activation</field><field name="subject">Human Computer Interface</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090629.095851</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paths to Knowledge Management In Small and Medium-sized Hotels</field><field name="creator">Kim, Mikyung</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to develop a better understanding of strategic paths to knowledge management in small and medium-sized hotels. This thesis has formulated a path knowledge concept and developed a PathFinder model. The formulation of the path knowledge concept and the development of the PathFinder model are based on an empirical investigation through the conduct of thirteen face-to-face in-depth interviews with owners/managers in small and medium-sized hotels. The interview data were analysed with the use of a purpose-built database and Structured Query Language for data manipulation. This study has identified four broad types of paths to knowledge management in small and medium-sized hotels. A hotel's choice of a path to knowledge management is essentially dependent on two defining aspects, the sources of revenue generation and knowledge management activities. The path knowledge concept reflects the growth visions of small and medium-sized hotels, whe re knowledge management is practised unconsciously as part of the integrated business operation. The PathFinder model represents the intentions of small and medium-sized hotels with regard to certain paths to knowledge management as influenced by various internal and external resources. The model provides strategic level decision making options for knowledge management and the basis for the development of future additions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge Management</field><field name="subject">Strategy</field><field name="subject">Small and Medium-sized Hotels</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090629.101029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fire, Families and Decisions</field><field name="creator">Proudley, Mae Amber</field><field name="description">This research explores the life experiences of families and couples who lived through the Wangary fire (South Australia, January 2005). Examining the bushfire experience from a domestic perspective is long overdue.        Open-ended interviews were conducted with thirty-eight couples and families across the fire-affected region on the Lower Eyre Peninsula. A shortlist of fourteen were analysed in detail and they form the foundation of this thesis.        These bushfire narratives include the perspectives of farming and non-farming families and cover a wide spectrum of circumstances and demographics. Five of the fourteen families lost their homes in the Wangary fire.       Critical decision-making and the presence of children is at the heart of this case study.  How the presence of babies and young children influences family decision-making, in advance of or during a bushfire, has not been considered or studied in any detail within the Australian research landscape.           Exploring the differences of experience between women with young families and older women confirms the primary weakness of the national bushfire safety ('stay or go') policy. Gender and generation were the two defining factors that informed how people responded to and recovered from the Wangary fire. The perspective of younger people, within the context of bushfire research, has been neglected in the past; this case study incorporates their views and thoughts.      It is hoped that insights gleaned from these bushfire narratives will encourage the enhancement of the national 'stay or go' policy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bushfire</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Family Decision-Making</field><field name="subject">National Bushfire Safety Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090629.102324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterising Evoked Potential Signals using Wavelet Transform Singularity Detection.</field><field name="creator">McCooey, Conor Gerard</field><field name="description">This research set out to develop a novel technique to decompose Electroencephalograph (EEG) signal into sets of constituent peaks in order to better describe the underlying nature of these signals.  It began with the question; can a localised, single stimulation of sensory nervous tissue in the body be detected in the brain?  Flash Visual Evoked Potential (VEP) tests were carried out on 3 participants by presenting a flash and recording the response in the occipital region of the cortex.  By focussing on analysis techniques that retain a perspective across different domains &#239;&#191;&#189; temporal (time), spectral (frequency/scale) and epoch (multiple events) &#239;&#191;&#189;  useful information was detected across multiple domains, which is not possible in single domain transform techniques.  A comprehensive set of algorithms to decompose evoked potential data into sets of peaks was developed and tested using wavelet transform singularity detection methods.  The set of extracted peaks  then forms the basis for a subsequent clustering analysis which identifies sets of localised peaks that contribute the most towards the standard evoked response.   The technique is quite novel as no closely similar work in research has been identified.  New and valuable insights into the nature of an evoked potential signal have been identified.  Although the number of stimuli required to calculate an Evoked Potential response has not been reduced, the amount of data contributing to this response has been effectively reduced by 75%.  Therefore better examination of a small subset of the evoked potential data is possible.  Furthermore, the response has been meaningfully decomposed into a small number (circa 20) of constituent peaksets that are defined in terms of the peak shape (time location, peak width and peak height) and number of peaks within the peak set.  The question of why some evoked potential components appear more strongly than others is probed by this technique.    Delineation between individual  peak sizes and how often they occur is for the first time possible and this representation helps to provide an understanding of how particular evoked potentials components are made up.  A major advantage of this techniques is the there are no pre-conditions, constraints or limitations. These techniques are highly relevant to all evoked potential modalities and other brain signal response applications &#239;&#191;&#189; such as in brain-computer interface applications.  Overall, a novel evoked potential technique has been described and tested.  The results provide new insights into the nature of evoked potential peaks with potential application across various evoked potential modalities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">evoked potentials</field><field name="subject">wavelet transform</field><field name="subject">singularity detection</field><field name="subject">clustering</field><field name="subject">electroencephalograph</field><field name="subject">EEG</field><field name="subject">brain computer interface</field><field name="subject">BCI</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080829.101311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Electromagnetic Field as a Modulator of a Protein Activity, and the Resonant Recognition Model</field><field name="creator">Vojisavljevic, Vuk</field><field name="description">In this study, it was experimentally proved, for the first time, that it is possible to predict the frequency of electromagnetic radiation that can modulate activity of proteins and more specifically activity of enzymes. The prediction was obtained using the computational model so called the Resonant Recognition Model (RRM). The model was tested here experimentally using the reaction catalysed with the enzyme l-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).     The RRM model was applied to the group of the enzymes belonging to the sub-subclass EC 1.1.1.27 i.e. l-lactate dehydrogenase.  The wavelengths of the electro magnetic radiation calculated by the RRM and proposed to alternate activity of l-lactate dehydrogenate were identified at  =620  25 nm and  =840   25 nm.    Enzyme activity was then measured after the exposure to the low-intensity, electromagnetic radiation (EMR) within the proposed EMR range [560-860 nm].   The experimental results have indeed shown that there is a significant increase in the activity of LDH only after irradiation within the range of the frequencies predicted by the RRM: 596nm (12%; P less than 0.001) and 829 nm (11.8%, P less than 0.001). These results prove successfully that activity of proteins and more specifically enzymes could be modified by EMR radiation of specific frequencies and even more that RRM computational model can successfully predict these frequencies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electromagnetic radiation</field><field name="subject">enzymes</field><field name="subject">Resonant Recognition Model (RRM)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080530.162332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Radiochromic Film Densitometry System Using Commercially Available Digital Camera and LEDs</field><field name="creator">Tran, Thu</field><field name="description">This project involved designing and building a radiochromic film (RCF) densitometer using a still digital camera as the light detector and light emitting diode, LED, as the light source. The behaviour of the LED and charged coupled device (CCD) in the still digital camera, under different light exposure settings (by changing LED current and camera shutter speed) were measured and an optimal setting was determined. Additionally, methods were devised and tests were carried out in order to spread the illumination area of the single light source. Uniform spreading of the LED illumination area was possible by the use of two diffusers placed at an optimum separation distance that was determined in this work.      The usefulness of this custom-made RCF densitometer was demonstrated by using this device to image exposed RCF and using the film analysis software, Image J, to determine the film absorbed dose. Two clinical situations were examined: open and virtual wedge radiation beams.      It was concluded that still digital cameras can be used in RCF densitometers provided they can capture and store raw images, a single diffused LED can illumination an area large enough for RCF densitometry and appropriate film analysis software is needed to extract and handle the large volume of greyscale data from the RCF.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radiochromic</field><field name="subject">Light Emitting Diode</field><field name="subject">Charged Coupled Device</field><field name="subject">Dosimetry</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080528.112722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of the Social Factors in Generating Innovation within Mature Industry Supply Chains &#239;&#191;&#189; A Case Study</field><field name="creator">Burgess, Kevin</field><field name="description">Supply chain literature has increasingly argued that supply chains are being used by a wide range of industries to generate innovations which deliver competitive advantage, and that social factors such as trust and collaboration play a key role in making effective supply chain management (SCM). Closer examination of the research suggests that much of this literature is based on studies of industries which deliver consumer products and these studies are predominantly conducted within a positivist research framework. This research bias has resulted in far less attention being paid to studies of mature industrial markets. This case study seeks to redress such bias by posing an overall question regarding the role of social factors in innovation within a well established supply chain which existed across three mature, capital intensive industries &#239;&#191;&#189; steel manufacturing, transport and railroad track construction and working outside the positivist paradigm by using a m ultidisciplinary research approach within a &#239;&#191;&#189;critical realist framework&#239;&#191;&#189;.        In responding to the overall research question, three subordinate questions were explored. Firstly, how well suited are present corporate governance structures of individual organisations to deal with the newly emerging interconnected organisational structures in order to support the generation of innovations within supply chains? Secondly, what has been the impact of the widespread adoption of information technology in generating innovation in supply chains? And thirdly, what is the role played by interorganisational social networks in generating innovations within supply chains?      The overall findings were that the social factors played a far more important role than had hitherto been acknowledged in either supporting or inhibiting innovation within supply chains. Corporate governance was seen to generally inhibit innovation between organisations. The claims of much of the SCM literature which asserts a strong link between IT and innovation in supply chains was not supported. In fact, it was found that the majority of subjects preferred to get information through social systems. The role of interorganisational networks (IONs) was found to be most effective at generating incremental innovations aimed at maintaining operational efficiency. A critical realist research approach was able to uncover some difficulties associated with a purely positivist research paradigm which restricts investigation to the empirical level of ontology. The critical realist approach was able to explore social causal mechanisms and structures which were not as readily accessible at the empirical level of inves tigation.  It was found that multiple realities existed across the supply chain, and that the positivist assumption of a mono reality which underpins much of the  enterprise resource planning (ERP), process management and governance approaches was in fact inhibiting the ability of the social system to be innovative and ultimately driving up costs. In fact a process management approach supported by information technology and operating within present corporate governance structures created conflicting goals which increased complexity.  A key finding of this study was how the open social system of the supply chain used dynamic relationships to overcome the rigidities and complexity of a closed systems logic embedded in the formal governance and information systems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Governance</field><field name="subject">Supply Chain Management</field><field name="subject">Inter-organisational networks</field><field name="subject">Innovation</field><field name="subject">Critical Realism</field><field name="subject">Enterprise Resource Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080414.143047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Precise Velocity and Acceleration Determination Using a Standalone GPS Receiver in Real Time</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Jianjun</field><field name="description">Precise velocity and acceleration information is required for many real time applications. A standalone GPS receiver can be used to derive such information; however, there are many unsolved problems in this regard. This thesis establishes the theoretical basis for precise velocity and acceleration determination using a standalone GPS receiver in real time.    An intensive investigation has been conducted into the Doppler effect in GPS. A highly accurate Doppler shift one-way observation equation is developed based on a comprehensive error analysis of each contributing factor including relativistic effects. Various error mitigation/elimination methods have been developed to improve the measurement accuracy of both the Doppler and Doppler-rate. Algorithms and formulae are presented to obtain real-time satellite velocity and acceleration in the ECEF system from the broadcast ephemeris. Low order IIR differentiators are designed to derive Doppler and Doppler-rate measurements from the raw GPS data for real-time applications. Abnormalities and their corresponding treatments in real-time operations are also discussed.   In addition to the velocity and acceleration determination, this thesis offers a good tool for GPS measurement modelling and for design of interpolators, differentiators, as well as Kalman filters. The relativistic terms presented by this thesis suggest that it is possible to measure the geopotential directly using Doppler shift measurements. This may lead to a foundation for the development of a next generation satellite system for geodesy in the future.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GPS</field><field name="subject">velocity determination</field><field name="subject">acceleration determination</field><field name="subject">Doppler effect</field><field name="subject">relativistic effects</field><field name="subject">differentiator design</field><field name="subject">Kalman filtering</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080121.142357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examination of Cellulolytic activity in Activated sludge, Leading to Elucidation of the Role of &#239;&#191;&#189;-1,4-endoglucanase enzyme in Aeromonas sp.YS3</field><field name="creator">Clinton, Brook</field><field name="description">The initial aim of this project was to uncover novel cellulolytic organisms or enzymes from the diverse microbial source, activated sludge. Two isolation methods were used; either directly inoculating the sludge material onto filter paper as a carbon source, or using the Evolver&#239;&#191;&#189; technology as an enrichment device. In both cases, as expected, cellulase activity was evident, however attributing this activity to one species was difficult in either case. This highlighted the complex interrelationships that existed between the many microorganisms present as the cellulosic carbon sources were degraded. In one instance, a Cellvibrio sp. was isolated. This genus of bacteria is known to possess both types of cellulase activity (exo- and endo- acting) and was therefore likely to contribute to the degradation of the cellulose.  However, the isolate, once purified, did not display significant cellulolytic ability as compared to the unpurified consortium of microorganisms.  Therefore, in each case, microorganisms responsible for the cellulolytic activity were not uncovered. It was suspected that the microorganisms responsible for some of the cellulolytic activity were protists.      During the isolation of microorganisms, an Aeromonas sp. bearing the novel phenotype (for this genus) of CMCase activity was isolated. This activity was at first suspected to contribute to the degradation of the filter paper that was seen during isolation. However, tests with the pure isolate suggested that the Aeromonas sp. CMCase was not used for cellulose catabolism. Ironically, the enzyme may instead function in the production of a cellulose-like exopolysaccharide by the bacterium. Part of a cellulose synthase operon was found in the genome of the Aeromonas sp. isolate, including a gene coding for an endoglucanase that gives a predicted molecular weight enzyme similar to the 39 kDa CMCase purified from the bacterium.       The CMCase enzyme, operating as part of of a synthetic operon is expected to be important in terms of the biofilm forming ability of this Aeromonas strain. Such capabilities of the bacterium were investigated here, including observing motility behaviour of the organism on agar surfaces. Studying the biofilm forming ability of this genus in general will be important in understanding how the fish and human pathogens persist in aquatic environments</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cellulose</field><field name="subject">Aeromonas</field><field name="subject">endoglucanase</field><field name="subject">enzyme discovery</field><field name="subject">cellulose synthase operon</field><field name="subject">biofilm</field><field name="subject">CMCase</field><field name="subject">exopolysaccharide</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080415.150448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management Accounting and Market Orientation: A Product-level Case-study Analysis</field><field name="creator">Inglis, Robert Michael</field><field name="description">Over the past two decades, research in both the management accounting and marketing disciplines has reported insightful developments, theoretically and empirically, in which both are implicated, yet research into the interface between the two disciplines remains relatively unexplored.       In the management accounting literature, a strategically-orientated approach has evolved in which customers, customer satisfaction, customer value and competitive positioning have developed as key management themes requiring a re-evaluation of the existing management accounting information for decision-making.  In marketing, research on &#239;&#191;&#189;market orientation&#239;&#191;&#189;, has emphasised similar and interrelated themes of customers, competitors, and the interfunctional coordination of organisational activities in the creation of customer value and the ascertainment and calculation of profits.      Taking market orientation as a point of departure, in this thesis a conceptual framework is developed which reflects the theoretical links between management accounting and market orientation at a product decision-making level.  The undertaking of two in-depth organisational case studies is reported in which market orientation and management accounting for each functional area is analysed and discussed.

Conventional fault location methods developed in the past many years are not suitable for FACTs transmission networks. The obvious reason is that FACTs devices in transmission networks introduce non-linearity in the system and hence linear fault detection methods are no longer valid. Therefore, it is still a matter of research to investigate developing new fault detection techniques to cater for modern transmission network configurations and solve implementation issues maintaining required accuracy.      This PhD research work is based on developing an accurate and robust new fault location algorithm for series compensated high voltage transmission lines, considering many issues such as transmission line models, configurations with series compensation features.  Building on the existing knowledge, a new algorithm has been developed for the estimation of fault location using the time domain approach. In this algorithm, instantaneous fault signals from the transmission line ends are measured and applied to the algorithm to calculate the distance to fault.   The new algorithm was tested on two port transmission line model developed using EMTP/ATP software and measured fault data from the simulations are exported to the MATLAB space to run the algorithm. Broad range of faults has been simulated considering various fault cases to test the algorithm and statistical results obtained. It was observed that the accuracy of location of fault on series compensated transmission line using this algorithm is in the range from 99.7 % to 99.9% in 90% of fault cases.      In addition, this algorithm was further improved considering many practical issues related to modern series compensated transmission lines (with TCSC var compensators) achieving similar accuracies in the estimation of fault location.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fault location</field><field name="subject">transmission lines</field><field name="subject">instantaneous values</field><field name="subject">series compensation</field><field name="subject">metal oxide varistor</field><field name="subject">algorithm</field><field name="subject">EMTP</field><field name="subject">MATLAB</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080418.120506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A novel gold nanoparticle-based approach for the rapid diagnosis of meningococcal infection</field><field name="creator">Basi Reddy, Sreenivasulu Reddy</field><field name="description">The bacterial meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Given the limitations of existing diagnostic tests and the severity of the illness associated with the disease, there is a clear requirement for a rapid and specific diagnostic assay. This thesis describes the development of nanoparticle based tests for the detection of Neisseria meningitidis specific cell surface markers.      As an initial target antigen, a recombinant form of highly conserved outer membrane protein, OMP85 was used. Within the OMP85 protein sequence, a predicted antigenic sequence between residues 720 and 745 was identified and found to be unique to this organism. This amino acid sequence was synthesised as peptide (SR1) with a gly-gly-cysteine spacer sequence at the N-terminus using t-boc chemistry. Also, the major virulence factor, capsular polysaccharide of N. meningitidis serogroup B bacteria was purified.      Polyclonal antibodies were raised against purified OMP85 antigen in rabbits and against SR1 peptide and also against formalin inactivated N. meningitidis serogroup B whole cell bacteria in sheep. This panel of different antibodies including the commercial anti-capsular monoclonal antibodies were examined for cross reactivity against a range of closely related Gram negative bacteria. Based on these cross-reactivity studies, a highly specific anti-NM antibody was developed following purification of the anti-SR1 antiserum by immuno-affinity chromatography.       Purified OMP85 antigen and anti-OMP85 antibody were successfully conjugated on 13, 30, 40, 50 and 60 nm gold nanoparticles by an electrostatic adsorption method. Coupling of the gold nanoparticles results in a shift of the respective surface plasmon peak toward longer wavelengths (in the range of 600-800 nm) resulting in a change of the colour of the colloidal suspension from red to purple to blue. An attempt was made to develop a rapid diagnostic assay based on gold nanoparticle induced colour shift assay for N. meningitidis by utilising the specific interaction of OMP85 and anti-OMP85 antibody conjugated to gold nanoparticles as a model system. However, this system was not reproducible and is likely to be due to problems with stability of gold nanoparticles during the conjugation process.      As an alternative approach, a highly selective quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)-based immunosensor was designed using the same OMP85/anti-OMP85 antibody system. A method was developed using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) coated QCM crystals with protein A for the directional orientation of the antibodies.       To further enhance the sensitivity of the test, OMP85-conjugated gold nanoparticles were used as signal amplification probes for the reproducible detection of the target down to 300 ng/mL, corresponding to a five fold increase in sensitivity compared to detection of OMP85 antigen alone. Also, this sensor has successfully been employed to detect whole cell bacteria at a concentration as low as 100 cfu/mL. Thus, in this study using the real-time QCM measurements, a novel strategy has been developed for the sensitive detection of both N. meningitidis bacteria and the protein antigen at very low concentrations, using gold nanoparticles as signal amplification probes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neisseria meningitides</field><field name="subject">OMP85</field><field name="subject">SR-1 peptide</field><field name="subject">gold nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">plasmon resonance</field><field name="subject">QCM</field><field name="subject">PVDF</field><field name="subject">immunosensor</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080730.165053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing the use of mobile banking: the case of SMS-based mobile banking</field><field name="creator">Yu, Shi</field><field name="description">Mobile banking is an application of mobile computing which provides customers with the support needed to be able to bank anywhere, anytime using a mobile handheld device and a mobile service such as text messaging (SMS). Mobile banking removes space and time limitations from banking activities such as checking account balances, or transferring money from one account to another. In recent research and studies it was found that while mobile banking and more specifically SMS-based mobile banking applications have become popular in some countries and regions, they were still not widely used. This study identifies and investigates the factors which influence customers&#8217; decision to use a specific form of mobile banking, and specifically focuses on the evaluation of SMS-based mobile banking in the context of New Zealand. The research model includes the basic concepts of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), as well as some constructs derived through a focus group discussion. The model is tested to determine its predictive power with respect to individual&#8217;s behaviour when considering the use of SMS-based mobile banking. A survey questionnaire was developed and employed to collect data from 250 AUT university students in New Zealand. The results of the data analysis contributes to the body of knowledge in the area by demonstrating that context specific factors such as service quality and service awareness are  influencing user perceptions about the usefulness of SMS mobile banking which in turn affect intention to use and adoption. Secondly, the study demonstrates, on the example of SMS-based mobile banking, how a hybrid approach involving qualitative data collection and a subsequent quantitative survey can help investigate how user perceptions about usefulness and ease of use are formed. Although the study has its limitations, the implications of the results allow providing practical recommendations to the banking industry, and directions for further work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile banking</field><field name="subject">Survey</field><field name="subject">Focus group</field><field name="subject">Text messaging</field><field name="subject">SMS</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of reflective mulch on Pinot noir grape and wine quality</field><field name="creator">Leal, G. R.</field><field name="description">A trial established in 2003 at Upper Moutere in Nelson, New Zealand, was used to evaluate the effect of mussel shells as reflective mulch on Vitis vinifera L. cv. Pinot noir vine performance and fruit and wine quality.  Shell mulch had several effects on the environment and vine growth as well as grape and wine composition in the 2006/2007 season. Soil under mulch was cooler compared to un-mulched control, but buffered the extremes in temperatures. Fruiting zone temperature over shells was slightly higher during the day and cooler at night, showing no effect on mean hourly temperature. Shell mulch reflected greater amounts of UV-A, UV-B and PAR radiation into the fruiting zone. Shell reduced weed growth compared to control. Leaf petiole and blade samples showed higher amounts of calcium compared to control. Leaf SPAD values were higher in the shell treatment during veraison, previous and postharvest, but lower post budburst. While date of budburst was not affected by treatments, dates of flowering and veraison appeared to be slightly advanced over shells. Fruit set was similar between treatments and was considered poorer in shell bunches due to a larger population of seedless berries. Vine growth was not affected in terms of the number of nodes laid at pruning, flower cluster and shoot number pre shoot thinning, early shoot growth and lateral shoots development. Vigour was not increased by shells as demonstrated by pruning weights, canopy density and trunk circumferences being similar, though internode lengths in shell shoots were greater in 2007 and lower in 2006. Berry weights, bunch weights and vine yields were lower in shell than control, though greater berry numbers were recorded. There were slight differences between treatments in fruit and wine composition. Grape pH only varied in the middle of the sampling time, being higher the 2nd week and lower the 3rd week in shell grapes and TA was greater at harvest time. However, &#176;Brix was only higher in shell grapes in the middle of the sampling period, being similar to control at veraison and harvest. Peduncle lignification was delayed at veraison as well as at harvest time. Shell must after crushing was greater in Brix but similar to control in pH and TA. Similarly, shell wines pre bottling showed higher alcohol and no differences for pH and TA. HPLC-DAD analyses of commercial-scale and microvin wines showed consistent differences of the individual flavonoid composition. Shell microvin wines were greater than control in quercetin and resveratrol. However, commercial shell wines were lower in epicatechin, gallic acid, resveratrol, and catechin than control. Leaf phenolic composition was also different between treatments. However, further analyses by HPLC-MS in wines as well as in leaves are necessary to identify individual compounds. Total anthocyanins and total phenolics were no different between treatments. Sensory analyses of microvin and commercial shell wines exhibited consistently lower levels of green and unripe tannins, and greater smoothness and complexity as well. Further analysis by GC-MS and HPLC-MS is warranted. Shell mulch improved sensory characteristics of the resulting wines.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pinot noir</field><field name="subject">mussel shell</field><field name="subject">reflective</field><field name="subject">UV radiation</field><field name="subject">wine phenolics</field><field name="subject">aroma compounds</field><field name="subject">mulch</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300305 Oenology and viticulture</field><field name="subject">Oenology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Causes of neonatal mortality in the New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos Hookeri) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Veterinary Pathology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Castinel, Aurelie</field><field name="description">As part of a health survey of New Zealand sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri) on Enderby Island, Auckland Islands (50&#176;30&#8217;S, 166&#176;17&#8217;E), neonatal mortality was continuously monitored at the Sandy Bay Beach rookery, from 1998/1999 to 2004/2005. The primary causes of death were categorised as trauma (35%), bacterial (24%) and hookworm (13%) infections, starvation (13%) and stillbirth (4%). During the 2001/2002 and 2002/2003 breeding seasons, bacterial epidemics caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae increased mortality by three times the mean in non-epidemic years. Uncinaria spp. from New Zealand sea lion (NZSL) pups was described for the first time using morphometric criteria. It differed from the two species already described in pinnipeds, Uncinaria lucasi and Uncinaria hamiltoni, suggesting the existence of a different morphotype in NZSLs. A study on the epidemiology of hookworm infection showed that all pups up to at least three months of age harboured adult hookworms in their intestines and transmammary transmission was identified as the route of infection of NZSL pups. Uncinariosis as a primary cause of mortality was generally associated with anaemia, haemorrhagic enteritis and frank blood in the lumen. The relationship between hookworm burden and clinical disease could not be clearly established. The 2001/2002 and 2002/2003 bacterial epidemics at Sandy Bay Beach rookery were caused by a clonal strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae as verified by pulse-field gel electrophoresis and antimicrobial testing. Suppurative arthritis was the most common post-mortem diagnosis during the two epidemic seasons. Internal lesions were consistent with septicaemia, which explained the wide range of organs from which the pathogen was grown in pure culture. A serological test investigating the exposure of NZSLs to Klebsiella spp. showed that the large majority of pups up to two months of age did not have any anti-Klebsiella antibodies, even after the epidemics, but that almost all the adults were seropositive. In addition, passive immunoglobulin (Ig) transfer from lactating females to neonates was examined by measuring IgG levels in pups and was very low compared to terrestrial mammals although similar to other pinniped neonates.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand sea lion</field><field name="subject">Phocarctos hookeri</field><field name="subject">pathology</field><field name="subject">pups</field><field name="subject">hookworms</field><field name="subject">Klebsiella pneumoniae</field><field name="subject">300500 Veterinary Medicine</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behold, be still : MFA thesis presented to the Faculty of Fine Arts, CoCA, Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Fine Arts</field><field name="creator">Ellis, Meighan</field><field name="description">behold, be still illuminates my predilection, that of a portrait photographer, which is driven by a fascination with viewing and collecting the &#8216;other&#8217;, the male, now extending into this suite of still moving portraits. Through this act and in my art practice, I uncover the vulnerabilities, both for myself and for my subjects, as they are offered for scrutiny on screen to become &#8216;public&#8217;, unlike their previous position in my photographic archive, which is private. I reveal for the first time my pathology in the drive to collect surrogates and stand-ins, to console the loss and give solace for the absence of one- revealing a latent scopophilia. Photography histories, specifically portraiture, and the moving image are discussed, focusing on the binaries of the medium/s, their reflective and reflexive qualities, and their inherent ability to reveal and conceal. My visual inquiry is an expansion to experiencing the portrait by presenting the sitters as close to &#8216;themselves&#8217; via the medium of high definition video portraits. I expel the implications of women looking at men, and review the work of both significant and historical feminine influences and contemporary women artists positioned and working in this territory and who employ both film and photography. I highlight Victorian women and the melancholic age, where photography is deeply embedded, tracing the origins and lineage to my current work. I seek to define and locate the notion of a beautiful masculine, investigating what it is to view, receive, and collect between the axis of photography and video via the intimate exchange and operatives of my gendered and privileged gaze. The success is determined by the tension between these two machines and resulting portraits, as the act in sitting for a portrait with the technology of today, renders a more &#8216;accurate&#8217; portrayal. From this the moving portrait completes the desire and an opportunity to obtain and possess the beloved after their absence.

Drawing on the Lacanian model of the Real used by Slavoj Zizek as a tool of cultural critique I suggest a new framework for a surrealist documentary practice.

The most widely used technologies utilise Chromium(VI) compounds for conversion coatings and primer additives in paint systems to provide corrosion protection to these alloys.  These compounds are highly toxic, carcinogenic and detrimental to the environment, therefore the identification of alternative systems that are safe and environmentally benign, that meet or exceed the current levels of corrosion protection is vital.  This research program examines the corrosion inhibition effectiveness of selected rare earth diphenyl phosphates (RE(dpp)3).  These compounds incorporate known inhibitor species, namely rare earth metals, organics and phosphates into a single complex, with the aim of achieving synergistic inhibition in corrosive environments.  A screening study utilising immersion and weight loss experiments identified Cerium diphenyl phosphate (Ce(dpp)3) and Mischmetal diphenyl phosphate (Mm(dpp)3) as the most effective inhibitors of corrosion for AA2024-T3.  The inhibiting efficiency, mechanism of inhibition and surface interaction of these complexes on aluminium alloy AA2024-T3 was characterised using a range of electrochemical and surface techniques.  A similar study was carried out using AA7075-T6 to assess the adaptability of the RE(dpp)3 compounds to protect different alloy compositions.  The complexes were effective in significantly reducing the corrosion rate of the alloys, with both the cathodic and anodic corrosion processes being suppressed.  This mixed inhibition was not attained with the constituent rare earth and diphenyl phosphate ions individually, indicating the need for the complex to remain intact in solution to achieve the high level of corrosion protection observed. The initiation and propagation of surface pits was effectively suppressed by the RE(dpp)3 complexes.  The combination of electrochemical and surface characterisation techniques has for the first time allowed insights into the mechanism of action of these compounds on aluminium alloys, and indicated deposition was initiated at electrochemically active intermetallic particles.  The mixed rare earth phases present in Mm(dpp)3 produced a synergistic effect, providing a greater degree of corrosion protection compared with Ce(dpp)3, particularly on AA2024-T3.  In the final phase of this research project the RE(dpp)3 inhibitor compounds were incorporated into an epoxy coating system, and demonstrated that the initiation of filiform corrosion on AA2024-T3 could be reduced by up to a factor of 3 by their addition.  The growth rate of filaments was also impeded.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corrosion inhibition</field><field name="subject">Aluminium alloys</field><field name="subject">Rare earth</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/74104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Airborne dust in Saudi Arabia: source areas, entrainment, simulation and composition</field><field name="creator">Alharbi, Badr Hadhidh A</field><field name="description">Spatial and temporal characteristics of dust storm activity in Saudi Arabia has been established using coarse-particle (PM10) dust concentrations recorded by the KACST monitoring network during the 2000-2003 period, backward trajectory analysis and satellite imagery. Thirty three major dust episodes impacted Riyadh city during the 2000-2003 period. The majority of these intense dust episodes are experienced during the March-August period with interannual and monthly variability in both intensity and frequency. Using TOMS images in conjunction with the backward trajectories corresponding to these 33 major episodes, the dust source regions have been identified. The most vulnerable dust source areas within these identified source regions have also been determined by compiling satellite images of dusty days from the true color SeaWiFs and high resolution MODIS archives over a six-year period (2000-2005). In total 45 dust-source areas have been identified in 9 local source regions and 4 external ones. Furthermore, 38 episodes of high fine-particle (PM2.5) and PM10 dust concentrations were observed at Riyadh city and 16 and 6 episodes of elevated PM10 dust concentrations were observed at Dammam and Jeddah cities, respectively, during March-September 2006, corresponding to the dust season in Saudi Arabia. During these episodes, Riyadh city was significantly impacted by dust from the southern Iraqi source areas and the eastern source areas located to the north and to the northeast of the city, respectively. Moreover, Dammam city was also significantly impacted by dust from the southern Iraqi source areas whereas Jeddah city was evenly impacted by dust from northeastern-northwestern sources to the city, with somewhat higher PM10 concentrations from African dust source areas, located to the northwest of the city. Analysis of meteorological maps of surface pressure as well as upper air data associated with high airborne dust concentrations in Saudi Arabia was successfully performed. This analysis revealed seven common types of dust storms, triggered by a clear seasonal distribution of meteorological conditions: (1) frontal, (2) Haboob, (3) jets convergence, (4) jet streak, (5) Shamal, (6) cyclonic, and (7) gap. The majority of dust episodes that impacted Riyadh city during the study period were triggered by Haboob (~ 42 %) and Shamal (~ 37 %). Additional analyses, including elemental, ionic and biological analyses as well as model analyses were used to further characterize the airborne dust in Saudi Arabia.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dust</field><field name="subject">Entrainment</field><field name="subject">Sauid Arabia</field><field name="subject">Dust storm activity</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/74116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phase I animal safety study of new second generation porphyrin based photosensitizers in the Syrian Golden hamster</field><field name="creator">Wittmann , Johannes , Clinical School - South Western Sydney, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Pancreatic cancer kills over 1700 people each year in Australia. In 2000, there were 1908 new cases diagnosed and it remains one of the least treatable malignancies. In the USA, it was the fourth leading cause of cancer death in 2004, with 31,860 new cases and 31,270 recorded deaths. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a novel, potentially useful treatment for locally advanced pancreatic cancer with only limited research and clinical work addressing this until now. PDT induces non-thermal, cytotoxic and ischaemic injury to a targeted volume of tissue. During PDT, a photosensitizer is activated by non-thermal light in the presence of oxygen, generating cytotoxic oxygen species and inducing cellular injury and microvascular occlusion. The aim of this thesis was to conduct an animal safety study using two second generation photosensitizers, talaporfin sodium and verteporfin, to assess the risks of pancreatic PDT by looking at injury to organs adjacent to the pancreas and assessing recovery from PDT treatment of the pancreas. The Syrian Golden hamster animal model was used to compare the results of this research to previous work by other authors. The study design incorporated a number of additional experiments, including quantitative tissue fluorescence techniques, plasma level analysis and histopathology techniques. The methods for the animal safety study were similar to the approach used in the clinical setting and provided vital data on the likely risks and side effects of phototherapy in humans. The first study, looking at talaporfin sodium, found likely risks of duodenal injury, gastric injury and death with a limited effect on normal pancreas at photosensitizer doses likely to be employed for pancreatic cancer PDT. The second study, using verteporfin, found similar results with a more potent effect on the normal pancreas at studied drug doses. Both agents had short drug-light intervals, ranging from 15 minutes to 2 hours, reducing the need for pre-treatment hospitalization and short photosensitivity periods of about one to two weeks. Some animals suffered minor cutaneous photosensitivity injuries. A human pancreatic cancer PDT pilot study is feasible and the risks and complications should be acceptable.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pancreatic cancer.</field><field name="subject">Talaporfin.</field><field name="subject">Verteporfin.</field><field name="subject">Porphyrins.</field><field name="subject">Hamsters as laboratory animals.</field><field name="subject">Photosensitization, Biological -- Congresses.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel biological functions of apolipoprotein-E</field><field name="creator">Elliott, David Anthony, Prince of Wales Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">ApoE is a polymorphic protein that has been found to play many different roles in biological processes including lipid transport, neurobiology and immunoregulation. ApoE occurs in the human population in three major isoforms; apoE2, apoE3 and apoE4. The apoE4 isoform has been identified as a major risk factor for several diseases including atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, therefore a greater understanding of apoE biology is highly sought after. In my thesis, I have investigated several novel aspects of apoE biology. I have identified an association between increased apoE expression and apoptosis in a neuronal cell type and demonstrated that apoE becomes enriched within the neuronal apoptotic debris, consistent with a possible role for apoE in facilitating apoptotic debris clearance. A possible anti-apoptotic role of apoE in macrophages was assessed by reducing or eliminating apoE expression using siRNA and cells isolated from apoE knockout animals, respectively. The removal of apoE did not alter overall sensitivity to apoptosis, however, it did significantly increase staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activation. In other studies, the poorly understood accumulation of apoE within the nucleus was found to be enhanced during serum starvation and to localise in intra-nuclear structures that are distinct from inter-chromatin granule clusters. Analysis of apoE within the human brain revealed a correlation between fragmentation and the apoE3 isoform which was independent from AD status and brain region examined. Additionally, a portion of brain apoE3 was found to be present in the form of disulphide-linked dimers. Collectively, these studies have further expanded the current knowledge of apoE biology in terms of its association with apoptosis, nuclear localization and structural differences between the apoE3 and apoE4 isoforms in the human brain.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Apoptosis.</field><field name="subject">Apolipoprotein-E.</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mass spectrometric characterization and analysis of anti-oxidative properties of medicinal herbs</field><field name="creator">Wang, Xiao Suo, School of Medical Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this project was to investigate a range of medicinal herbs which have radical scavenging and antioxidant activities and then apply novel mass spectrometric techniques to investigate and analyse active components responsible for their pharmaceutical actions. A sensitive electron capture negative ionization of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (ECNI-GC-MS) method was developed to assess hydroxyl radical production, as indicated by 3.4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) production, which allows excellent evaluation of hydroxyl radical scavenging and antioxidant activity of a number of medicinal Chinese herbs. Melatonin is an effective multiple radical scavenger and antioxidant and has been used in this study for the comparison of radical scavenging activity with medicinal herbs. To analyse active compounds from herbal extracts, mass spectrometric techniques were used to separate components that suppressed hydroxyl radical production from Dimocarpus longan Lour, determine known ginsenosides from ginseng extracts as well as to identify and quantify melatonin in ten herbal extarcts. The results obtained indicated that 1) the utilization of alumina in the ECNI-GC-MS method diminished interferences from ???noise??? products in a Fenton-type reaction, which allows obtaining pure final hydroxyl radical product and this method demonstrated optimal sensitivity and reliability; 2) Aqueous extracts of all herbs analysed showed different levels of hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. Dimocarpus longan Lour, Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat, Lonicera hypoglauca Miq, Ginkgo biloba L, Rehmannia flutinosa and Libosch Cornus officinalis Sieb all exhibited stronger inhibitory effect on hydroxyl radical production than melatonin. 3) Aqueous extract of Dimocarpus longan Lour. showed the greatest inhibitory effect on hydroxyl radical production among the other herbs tested. The active fractions of this herb eluted just after the void volume using HPLC suggesting that the active compounds responsible for radical scavenging activity are polar and water soluble.

Chinese fresh ginseng (Oriental ginseng) showed higher activity than Korean ginseng tablet and American ginseng. Seven known active ginsenosides were identified using HPLC-MS-MS. 6) Melatonin was found at varying concentrations in ten herbs, which may contribute to the radical scavenging activity of herbs, on the other hand, it may provide the justification of clinical use and food resources, particularly for those herbs contain high level of melatonin.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Herbs</field><field name="subject">Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Antioxidants</field><field name="subject">Mass spectrometry</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19180</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anchorage and encapsulation failure mechanisms of rockbolts ??? stage 2</field><field name="creator">Weckert, Steven, Mining Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Fully Encapsulated Resin Bolt (FERB) is widely utilised for strata control and ground support in civil and mining applications worldwide, with approximately 6 million installed per annum by the Australian coal mining industry.  Independent studies have concluded that 30-35% of these rockbolts, which represents an annual expenditure of $40 million, are ineffective. The anchorage and failure mechanisms of FERB are yet to be quantified, and support systems are designed primarily from empirical rather than scientific methods.  There are no standardised methods of assessing FERB components, installation techniques and support behaviour.  The majority of research into FERB support systems remains commercial intellectual property, with little information released into the public domain. This thesis investigated several variables of FERB support systems, and also examined differences between field and laboratory pull-out test load distributions.  This research was conducted in two phases, with Phase 1 seeking standardised methodology and repeatability in results, while Phase 2 further refined Phase 1 methods and extended the range of tests.  The results in both phases were encouraging, with reasonable repeatability attained in all testing series.  The findings included:  ???	Annulus Thickness:  There was little change in load capacity with small annulus thickness, however the maximum peak load (MPL) significantly reduced once annulus thickness exceeded 4mm  ???	Resin Installation Spin Time:  Underspinning of cartridge resin was found to have an insignificant effect on rockbolt load/deformation characteristics.  Overspinning, however, led to a dramatic reduction in anchorage performance with a lessening in both MPL and stiffness  ???	Rockbolt Load Transfer:  The magnitude of an applied load reduced to zero along the length of the rockbolt, being greatest nearest the rock free surface (the point of load application).  An exponential reduction was found when tested in the manner of laboratory tests, with the loading jack reacting against the free surface.  This reduction was linear when the load was applied as in the field, with no load placed on the free surface This basic investigation into FERB support systems has validated many empirical understandings of rockbolts, while highlighting the need for further testing into several key areas.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mine roof bolts</field><field name="subject">Resin ??????

The two MPs, Arthur Coles and Alex Wilson, supported the conservative Menzies and Fadden governments before shifting their support (on October 3 1941) to the Labor Party led by Curtin. The procedure followed is the examination, in the form of a historical narrative, of primary evidence in private papers (such as Coles???s), analysis of Hansard (CPD), local and metropolitan newspapers. Also examined are references to the two independents in secondary literature. The key focus of interest will be the idea that chance or serendipity played a major role in achieving all the key outcomes which many Australians (and historians like Hasluck) often otherwise depict as the triumph of good sense within a supposedly non-problematic twoparty political system which self-selected the best possible leadership during time of war. Coles took over the seat of a popular Cabinet minister who had died in an air disaster. Coles???s and Wilson???s holding the balance of power was another extreme aberration, as no House of Representatives from 1906 to 1940, and none since, has not had either of the two party blocs (Labor and anti-Labor) without a majority. Hasluck, the most influential historian of Australian politics during the 1939-1945 war, viewed the fact of Coles???s and Wilson???s serendipity as evidence, in itself, of their wider historical, ideological and political irrelevance. The general results obtained by pursuing a critical historical narrative approach is that a strong counter-argument has been developed that suggests that Hasluck (and wider historical memory) has insufficiently valued as historical factors Coles???s and Wilson???s ideological aims. Coles was a representative of business progressivism and Wilson of agrarian socialism. The major conclusion reached is that Coles???s and Wilson???s wider aims led them to adopt the tactic of timing their shift to Labor so as to maximize their ideological influence on the Labor administration that would result whenever they decided to exercise their entirely serendipitously attained balance of power.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">politics and government</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catalytic distillation for the synthesis of tertiary butyl alcohol</field><field name="creator">Safinski, Tomasz, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Catalytic Distillation for the synthesis of tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) is investigated in this thesis. The solvent, ethylene glycol, is proposed as a means of overcoming challenges, which limit the potential benefits of the application of reactive separation for TBA. The proposed action of the solvent is that of extractive distillation entrainer, thus a new unit operation of Catalytic Extractive Distillation (CED) is suggested. The solubility of isobutylene in water, TBA, and ethylene glycol and their binary and ternary mixtures, at different temperatures, is measured and correlated. The solubility is found to be highly non-linear in solutions containing TBA. The kinetics of isobutylene hydration over Amberlyst 15 is characterised in the presence of ethylene glycol. The solvent is found to promote reaction rate, however it is also found to compete for reaction with isobutylene. Water is found to strongly inhibit the reaction of ethylene glycol and isobutylene. The selectivity ratio of TBA to by products is determined and found to improve with increased temperature and lower solvent concentration. Bale packing is chosen as catalytic distillation hardware for the containment of Amberlyst 15 and its two-phase fluid dynamics characterised for the first time. Raschig rings are used as a benchmark for the study. Bale packing is found to exhibit two ranges of backmixing behaviour in the pre-loading regime. This behaviour is attributed to the three levels of porosity of the hardware and indicative of low rates of catalyst/liquid renewal. The effectiveness of ethylene glycol as extractive distillation entrainer for the separation of the TBA/water azeotrope over Bale packing is investigated and the solvent found to be highly effective. The mass transfer resistances to isobutylene transport are determined for countercurrent fixed bed reactor (CFBR) application of Bale packing. It is found that ethylene glycol improves mass transfer coefficients attainable. Catalytic Extractive Distillation is implemented over Bale packing and the ability of the solvent to improve reaction rates and purity of TBA demonstrated. However, the reaction rates achieved have much scope for improvement through increased isobutylene availability. In response to poor liquid renewal of static packing such as Bale packing and the necessity of improved isobutylene transport a new form of catalytic distillation reactor design is proposed, the Basket Impeller Column (BIC). The BIC combines the mass transfer benefits of a rotating basket reactor with that of a dual flow column. Capacity of the new hardware is determined and correlated. Separation and reactive separation are demonstrated to be feasible. It is found that Damk??hler number can be varied directly using the additional process variable of speed of rotation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">butanol</field><field name="subject">distillation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A computational model for the assessment and prediction of salinisation in irrigated areas</field><field name="creator">Xu, Peng, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of a computational study on salt transport and accumulation in crop root zone. The main objective of this study is to examine the impacts of past land use on the environment and to examine the effect of irrigation water on the rising of groundwater level and the subsequent salinity problem in rice growing area under given climatic conditions. A special focus has been such impacts in the Wakool irrigation area, NSW, Australia. To this end, a computational model for the assessment and prediction of salinisation in agricultural areas has been developed. This modelling system consists of a land surface scheme (ALSIS) for simulating unsaturated soil moisture and moisture flux, a groundwater flow model (MODFLOW) for estimating the spatial and temporal variations of groundwatertable, a surface flow model (DAFLOW) for calculating water flow in river networks, a module for calculating solute transport at unsaturated zone and a 3-D model (MOC3D) for simulating solute transport in groundwater as well as a module for calculating the spatial and temporal distributions of overland flow depth during wet seasons. The modelling system uses a finite difference linked technique to form a quasi three dimensional model. The land surface scheme is coupled with the groundwater flow model to account for the interactions between the saturated and unsaturated zones. On the land surface, the modelling system incorporates a surface runoff model and detailed treatments of surface energy balance, which is important in es-timating the evapotranspiration, a crucial quantity in calculating the moisture and moisture fluxes in the root zone. Vertical heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties in the soil profile has been considered. The modelling system has the flexibility of using either Clapp and Hornberger (1978), Broadbridge and White (1988), van Genuchten (1980) or Brooks and Corey (1966) soil water retention models. Deep in the soil, the impact of groundwater table fluctuation on soil moisture and salinity in the unsaturated soil is also included. The calibration and validation for the system have been partially performed with observed groundwater levels in the Wakool irrigation area. The applications of the model to theWakool region are made in two steps. Firstly, a one-dimensional simulation to a selected site in the Wakool irrigation area is carried out to study the possible impact of ponded irrigation on salinisation and the general features of salt movement. Secondly, a more realistic three-dimensional simulation for the entire Wakool region is performed to study the spatial and temporal variations of root zone soil salinity under the influence of past land use from 1975 to 1994. To allow the assessment and prediction of the effects of ponded rice irrigation water (which contains salt) on soil salinity in the area, several hypothetical scenarios using different qualities of water for rice irrigation are tested. To facilitate comparative analysis of different scenarios, a base case is defined, for which irrigation water is assumed to be free of salt. The simulated results show that irrigation increases overall recharge to groundwater in the Wakool irrigation area. The use of ponded irrigation for rice growing has a substantial effect on salt accumulation in the root zone and the rising of groundwater level, indicating that irrigation at rice bay is a major budget item for controlling soil salinity problem in the local area.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wakool Land and Water Management Plan (N.S.W.); Irrigation -- Mathematical models; Salinization -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The observation and modelling of winds over South Eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Batt, Kenneth Leslie, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study uses a very high resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) model to investigate the complex structure and behaviour of cold fronts along the New South Wales coast during the warmer months of the year, the complex interaction between the wind flow and coastlines and elevated areas as well as the lee-trough effect, particularly the way it affects waters off the east coast of Tasmania, The study also investigates the utility of the higher resolution NWP model to better predict wind fields compared to a lower resolution model.  The University of New South Wales very high resolution model (HIRES), nested in the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's coarse NWP model (GASP), was run at various horizontal resolutions (from 15 to 25km) in order to investigate the above-mentioned features. It was found to bave very good skill in resolving the features and was also found to be very accurate in the prediction of surface wind fields for various yacht race events out to at least four days ahead.  It can be concluded that there is considerable skill in the ability of high-resolution NWP models such as HIRES, to predict the major features of the wind fields over the ocean out to several days ahead. Moreover, it was also able to more accurately simulate the complex structure of the summer-time cool change as it progressed along the NSW coast than the lower resolution model runs. The influence of coastlines, particularly ones with complex topographical features, on the wind flow was demonstrated to a limited extent throughout the study. Finally the following concepts were also verified as a result of the study: - air flow takes the path of least resistance - the shape of topography can help generate local turbulence - the orientation of the wind flow to a mountain range is important in determining turbulent effects. - under certain airflow and stability situations, standing wave activity and a lee trough can be observed in the lee of mountains, hills or even high coastal cliffs.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Weather forecasting</field><field name="subject">Wind erosion -- Computer simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The international dimensions of nationalism in Central Asia: can the relationship between international security, state sovereignty and emerging ethnonationalism be reconciled in Post-Soviet Central Asia?</field><field name="creator">Dilleen, Connor, School of Politics &amp; International Relations, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis tracks the emergence of western forms of nationalism in republics of Post- Soviet Central Asia, and assesses the likelihood of ethnic conflict in the region, and its probably consequences. It also considers the means by which the heterogenous populations in Central Asia may be more effectively accommodated within the individual republics. The thesis is conceived in three sections. The first section examines the causes and consequences of ethnic conflict, and discusses the implications of ethnic conflict in Central Asia from the perspective of state sovereignty and international security. The second section assesses the evolution of ethnicity and identity in Central Asia, the impact of Soviet nationalities policies and the impact of newly enforceable territorial sovereignty on the interconnected populations of the region. The third, and concluding, section considers the impact of state actors and regional and international institutions on the Central Asian republics, and considers strategies that may mitigate the potential for ethnic conflict in the region. The thesis concludes that emerging ethnonationalism in Post-Soviet Central Asia poses a real threat to regional and international security. The individual republics are pursuing policies which discriminate against large proportions of their populations. The Central Asian republics are also struggling with their newly found sovereignty, especially in respect to their asymmetrical relationships with states such as Russia, China and the U.S.A. The republics should consider alternative forms of governance, such as national cultural autonomy or consociation, which may contribute to a lessening of the tensions between ethnic or identity groups. The international community, in the form of the United Nations or other appropriate organisations, should recognise the potential for ethnic conflict in the region, and should actively encourage the states to adopt innovative forms of government that accommodate the diverse needs of their heterogenous populations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nationalism -- Asia</field><field name="subject">Sovereignty</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic heat equations with memory in infinite dimensional spaces</field><field name="creator">Xie, Shuguang, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with stochastic heat equation with memory and nonlinear energy supply. The main motivation to study such systems comes from Thermodynamics, see [85]. The main objective of this work is to study the existence and uniqueness of solutions to such equations and to investigate some fundamental properties of solutions like continuous dependence on initial conditions. In our approach we follow the seminal papers by Da Prato and Clement [10], where the stochastic heat equation with memory is tranformed into an integral equation in a function space and the so-called mild solutions are studied. In the aforementioned papers only linear equations with additive noise were investigated. The main contribution of this work is the extension of this approach to nonlinear equations. Our main tools are the theory of stochastic convolutions as developed in [33] and the theory of resolvent kernels for deterministic linear heat equations with memory, see[10]. Since the solution at time t depends on the whole history of the process up to time t, the resolvent kernel does not define a semigroup of operators in the state space of the process and therefore a ???standard??? theory of stochastic evolution equations as presented in the monograph [33] does not apply. A more delicate analysis of the resolvent kernles and the associated stochastic convolutions is needed. We will describe now content of this thesis in more detail. Introductory Chapters 1 and 2 collect some basic and essentially well known facts about the Wiener process, stochastic integrals, stochastic convolutions and integral kernels. However, some results in Chapter 2 dealing with stochastic convolution with respect to non-homogenous Wiener process are extensions of the existing theory. The main results of this thesis are presented in Chapters 3 and 4. In Chapter 3 we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to heat equations with additive noise and either Lipschitz or dissipative nonlinearities. In both cases we prove the continuous dependence of solutions on initial conditions. In Chapter 4 we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions and continuous dependence on initial conditions for equations with multiplicative noise. The diffusion coefficients defined by unbounded operators are allowed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stochastic integral equations</field><field name="subject">Heat equation</field><field name="subject">Dimensional analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Virtual imaging system</field><field name="creator">Wang, Lulu</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this research project was to implement a combination of computer graphics and processing to generate displays that will aid in the visualization of the colour rendering properties of a range of light sources, including the new generation of high-output LEDs (light emitting diodes) that are becoming widely adopted in general lighting service. The CIE (International Commission on Illumination) has developed a colour appearance model CIECAM02 for use in colour imaging and colour management, and this model is utilized in this work.	This thesis describes the design and construction of a computer-based model that can be used as a research tool for the simulation and demonstration of the colour rendering properties of various artificial light sources. It is a comprehensive study of the colour models and measurement procedures currently in use in the lighting industry, as recommended by the CIE. This research project focused on the display of a set of surface colour patches as if they were illuminated by a specific light source, and the simultaneous display of two such sets to demonstrate the surface colour differences arising from the use of the two different light sources. A VIS (virtual imaging system) has been developed to display the colour properties of a series of test colour samples under different light sources. This thesis describes the computer models developed for the representation and display of surface colours in general, and colour rendering in particular. The designed system computes and displays the colour of each sample from a knowledge of the light-source spectrum and the spectral reflectance of each surface. It can simultaneously display the colours resulting from illumination by two different sources. In addition, the system computes the colour appearance differences for two sets of colours using the CIECAM02 colour appearance model. Subjective and objective tests were taken to validate the computed results. The VIS has been designed and implemented. It also has been tested by 21 observers and we believe that it will be a powerful research tool for the lighting industry, especially in relation to colour rendering.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LED</field><field name="subject">Computer modelling</field><field name="subject">Artificial lighting</field><field name="subject">Colour rendering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/668</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understandings of being Pakeha : exploring the perspectives of six Pakeha who have studied in Maori cultural learning contexts : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management, Communication Management, at Massey University, Turitea Campus, Aotearoa-New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mitcalfe, Margaret Ann</field><field name="description">This research studies Pakeha who have engaged with Maori cultural learning contexts.

However, the frequency with which it is espoused belies the complexities associated with its practical application. Engaging communities in primary health care programmes designed to improve their health has been identified as a major challenge. This study&#8217;s objective was to explore community members&#8217; perspectives of participation within a health development programme. The programme chosen aimed to increase the fruit and vegetable intake of targeted population groups, including M ori, Pacific peoples, and low income earners. A qualitative instrumental case study approach was adopted to examine the programme and investigate what influenced, constrained, and sustained community participation. Data collection included fieldwork over an eighteen-month period. Two programme projects were selected as the study foci: a communityled project involving distributions of thousands of free heritage variety plants; and, instigated by health services, a project establishing community gardens. These projects provided markedly different pictures of participation occurring within the same programme. The plant distributions had widespread appeal, while the community garden faltered. Community participation fitted within a description of &#8216;focused social action&#8217;. Participation was motivated by needs, values, and interests. While some were personal and family based, the programme also became an imagined vehicle for addressing wider health, social justice, and environmental sustainability goals. Ongoing challenges related to defining targeted communities and groups, varying degrees and types of participation, and different perspectives of participation, especially as health sector staff worked from an equity mandate and community members spoke of equality. Programme groups established as mechanisms to foster community participation had contradictory effects, engaging some as advisors, while failing to reach communities targeted for the programme. The complexities of health sector bureaucracy both enabled and constrained the programme and community participation. This thesis provides an in-depth examination of the complexities of community participation in action, the contradictory effects of contexts enveloping programmes, and the resolve of community members. It increases our understandings of how community members perceive health programmes and community participation, which are critical factors in improving population health.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community participation</field><field name="subject">primary health care programmes</field><field name="subject">disadvantaged communities</field><field name="subject">Maori and Pacific</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">fruit and vegetable intake</field><field name="subject">community gardens</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321216 Health promotion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/886</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The distribution of fatty acids and presence of environmental contaminants in the blubber of the New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donaldson, Laura Patricia Constance</field><field name="description">The conservation of marine mammals relies on the knowledge of species ecology in order to assess the impacts of anthropogenic activites and make appropriate species management decisions. Blubber biopsies are a relatively non-invasive sampling protocol to provide ecological information; two particular uses are for dietary analysis via fatty acid signature analysis (FASA) and investigating the uptake of organochlorine (OC) and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) environmental contaminants. Blubber composition and structure may vary according to body site and depth due to its dynamic functioning. This may result in the vertical stratification and heterogenous distribution of blubber FAs, OCs and PCBs between body sites, giving variable interpretations of diet and contaminant levels depending on biopsy sample site and depth. The aim of this thesis is to determine the FA distribution of blubber from two body sample sites (dorsal pelvic and ventral thoracic) currently used for FASA of the New Zealand sea lion, Phocarctos hookeri (NZSL) and to determine the level of OCs and PCBs in the blubber of healthy NZSLs for comparison to diseased NZSLs recorded in the 1997/98 epidemic. Blubber samples were collected from 29 by-caught NZSLs incidentally captured by the squid fishery around the Auckland Islands (50&#186;42&#8217;S, 166&#186;5&#8217;E) during the years 2005 to 2007 (not all NZSLs were able to be analysed for each chapter). Full blubber cores from both sample sites were collected from 18 NZSLs. Both sites showed a relative homogeneity of FA profiles, indicating the similar deposition and mobilisation of FAs at the two sample sites. To determine if FA stratification occurred, full blubber cores from both sample sites of 20 NZSLs were divided into inner and outer halves. Both sites displayed the same pattern of vertical stratification or biochemical layering of FAs between the two divisions, indicating that stratification of FAs occurs in the blubber of the NZSL. A range of OCs and PCBs were then determined in full thoracic blubber cores of seven NZSLs. The levels were higher than those previously recorded in NZSLs affected by disease during a 1997/98 epidemic. The SPCB in NZSLs was 0.034-0.192 mg/kg lipids, below the suggested threshold of 17 mg/kg for adverse health affects in marine mammals. From the results of this study I can support current blubber biopsy sampling techniques for FASA in NZSL. Obtaining full blubber cores from either the thoracic or pelvic sample site will give a comparable interpretation of diet. The low levels of blubber OCs and PCBs suggest a minor role of contaminants acting as a possible causative agent toward disease outbreaks in the NZSL. This research provides important information for developing correct and consistent blubber sampling techniques for NZSL and other pinniped species. This will ensure more accurate interpretations of ecological information obtained from blubber biopsies and therefore improved species management and conservation decisions that may be based on such research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">species management</field><field name="subject">PCBs</field><field name="subject">blubber sampling</field><field name="subject">marine mammals</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300804 Environmental impact assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/887</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the epiphytic bacterial community associated with the green alga Ulva australis</field><field name="creator">Tujula, Niina Amanda, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Epiphytic bacterial communities on the surfaces of marine algae are poorly characterised. Most information available on marine bacterial epiphytes is derived from culture-based studies. With the rapid development of molecular community analysis technologies, it is now possible to obtain a more comprehensive picture of marine microbial populations on living surfaces. The intertidal macroalga Ulva australis, belongs to the cosmopolitan group of green marine algae (Ulvales) known to require the presence of bacteria for normal growth and has been suggested to employ specific bacteria for the defence against fouling by micro- and macro-organisms. This thesis has examined the composition and structure of the surface associated bacterial community on Ulva australis using 16S rRNA gene clone library, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and catalysed reporter deposition ??? fluorescence in situ hybridisation (CARD-FISH) analysis. The 16S rRNA gene clone library revealed that the five main bacterial groups present in the surface associated community were Bacteriodetes, Planctomycetes, Alpha-, Gamma-, and Delta-Proteobacteria. Twenty-two sequence phylotypes were identified, suggesting that the epiphytic community was of relatively low diversity. A clone similar to an algal morphogenesis inducing Cytophaga strain was identified, indicating that U. australis harbours bacteria important for thallus structural maintenance. DGGE analysis showed that while the bacterial community varied over spatial and temporal (seasons) scales it also included a stable subpopulation consistently associated with the seaweed surface. Sequencing of selected DGGE bands suggested that members of the Alphaproteobacteria and the Bacteriodetes belonged to the stable subpopulation. Using CARD-FISH with different phylogenetic probes demonstrated that Alphaproteobacteria (~ 70%) and Cytophaga-Flavobacteria (~13%) constituted the majority of bacterial cells on the surface of U. australis. A comparison of the results provided by the molecular community analysis methods, employed in this thesis, and those of culturing of epiphytic bacteria from U. australis revealed that each approach provides different patterns of phylogeny and extent of diversity. For example, the culture collection and the clone library detected a relatively high amount of Gammaproteobacteria, however, DGGE and CARD-FISH did not. Also, low  species diversity clone sequences and isolates of Alphaproteobacteria contrasted with the high numbers detected by the DGGE analysis. In addition to the phylogentic determination of the epiphytic bacterial community, CARDFISH was also used to assess the organisation and distribution of bacterial cells across different zonal regions on seaweed surface. It was found that approximately 40% of bacterial cells clustered in aggregates, or microcolonies. These aggregations were considered to be heterogeneous in composition and were mainly comprised of multiply species. The occurrence of more non-viable solitary single rather than aggregated cells suggests that aggregates might offer greater protection to bacterial cells from the harsh conditions in the intertidal zone. More broadly, CARD-FISH was found to be a useful tool for studying microcolonies and was also successfully applied to detect slow growing soil microcolonies cultivated using a novel soil substrate membrane system culturing technique without the need to perform an rRNA enrichment incubation. The findings in this thesis, as described from the application of a number of molecular community analysis techniques such as clone library, DGGE and CARD-FISH, have improved our understanding of the diversity and structure of the epiphytic bacterial community associated with U. australis.

It sought to understand why gay men would want to live in places that are said to have a reputation for hostility towards them. The empirical data from the semi-structured interviews with twenty-one gay men living in fifteen small-town locations across New South Wales, Australia, was analysed using a qualitative method derived from phenomenology, ethnography and modified grounded theory. The distinctive findings of this thesis centre on these men???s desire and determination to stay in the bush. They chose to stay in rural locations and effectively employed a diverse range of strategies to both combat the difficulties of rural life and enhance its advantages. The bush was the place in which these men could find themselves, be themselves and also find others like themselves. The space and the isolation of the bush gave them the latitude and the scope to live gay lives. This is why they stayed. By staying, they were also able to live out both the homosexual and rural components of their personal and social identity. Building on a brief look at the Australian rural past, the conceptual framework utilises notions of ???the stranger??? and draws on resilience, agency and resistance theory to understand these men???s ability to live in an unwelcoming place. Resilience allowed these men to cope and deal with the difficulties they faced. Human agency, the individual's capacity to exert autonomy over his life, is used to restore prominence to resistance theory. Agency is the catalyst to resistance and resistance fuels an individual???s, and sometimes a collective, opposition to the dominant social forces that inhibits one???s agency. These men???s desire to live in a rural place can be understood through theoretical considerations of place, the freedom of place and queer theory. Their satisfaction with life can be theorised through the application of a concept new to theory in gay literature - thriving. This thesis documents a largely unreported aptitude and proficiency by rural gay men to live in the bush. It suggests that their close affinity with place gives them a sense of belonging that, when combined with their concept of a gay lifestyle, effectively queers the places in which they live. That gay men can live fulfilled lives in the very places they are said to have fled evokes an innovative perspective together with an appreciation of what it is to be gay in the bush.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gay men -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Rural gay men -- New South Wales -- Interviews</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">OFDM receiver design with iterative techniques</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Xuan Huan, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Recent advances in iterative signal processing have allowed communication systems to obtain near optimal performance with manageable complexity. The idea of iteratively exchanging the reliability information among the components within a receiver to improve overall performance is known as the turbo concept or turbo processing. Based on the principle of turbo processing, this thesis investigates the key issues in designing a receiver for high data rate multicarrier wireless systems. The particular focus is on the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique which can be potentially targeted for the 4th generation communication systems. The first part of the thesis addresses the primary issues in an OFDM receiver such as channel estimation, carrier frequency offset (CFO) compensation, and decoding. Since the optimal solutions require a high load of computation, iterative algorithms are generally desirable. The soft information from the decoder/detector can be efficiently incorporated into the channel estimator/CFO compensator, which consequently results in better performance of the receiver. The thesis provides a framework of iterative algorithms for OFDM receivers in which the converged performances are close to those of the optimal solutions. In the second part of the thesis, the iterative algorithms for the spatial diversity channels, or in other words, multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channels, are investigated. Together with capacity potential, MIMO channels bring in some new challenges. With a number of antennas on both the transmitting and receiving sides, inter-antenna and co-antenna interference is the arising concern in addition to the conventional intersymbol interference problem. Also, most of the optimal signal processing algorithms within a receiver have complexities which are at least proportionally if not exponentially increasing with the number of antennas. This creates challenges for implementing signal processing algorithms at the receiver. We therefore investigate and design manageable-complexity iterative algorithms for spatial diversity channels. In particular, we develop novel decision feedback detectors for the single user scenario, and then propose a jointly iterative multiuser detection and cell-related interference cancellation scheme for the multiuser scenario. Again, it is verified that the iterative algorithms can be effectively used as near-optimal solutions for OFDM system with spatial diversity channels.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26776</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Flinders current and upwelling in submarine canyons</field><field name="creator">Arthur, William Craig, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">The continental shelf off South Australia is incised by some of the largest known submarine canyons. Extensive observations of submarine canyons in other parts of the world have shown submarine canyons can result in locally persistent upwelling regions. Along the southern coastline, westward slope currents including anticyclonic eddies and the Flinders Current (FC) can result in favourable conditions for upwelling in the vicinity of these canyons. Little data is available to describe the FC and so we review three global ocean circulation models and their representation of the FC. Though there are considerable differences between the outputs of these three models, this analysis provides a range of potential scales for the structure and transport of the FC. The reasons for the differences between the output of the three models are extensive, but to a first approximation, climatological surface wind stress products are compared. Dynamical descriptions of the flow past submarine canyons are reviewed and in part extended, in particular the vertical scale of the induced motion is estimated as the Rossby height RH. A description of upwelling and downwelling flow incorporating vorticity stretching is also presented. An idealised model of the southern Australian continental shelf and the submarine canyons reveals the circulation is heavily modified by the presence of the canyons, inducing persistent upwelling of dense water onto the downstream shelf. In addition, one prominent feature of the induced circulation ??? a coastal jet ??? is found to be peculiar to flat inner shelf topographies. More realistic topography including a sloped inner shelf results in reduced shoreward transport within the canyon and hence reduced upwelling.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28871</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vibrational characteristics of structures with uncertainty</field><field name="creator">Lucas, Geoffrey Iain, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the prediction of the vibro-acoustic response of structures with uncertain properties in the mid frequency region. The motivation for this research is the growing need of engineers to understand the responses of a group of similar structures ranging from vehicles, aircraft and aerospace structures, to household whitegood appliances. These structures are complex in geometry and may possess variability in their material or geometric properties, as well as variation arising from the assembly and manufacturing processes. Small variations can have a significant effect on a dynamic response of a structure, and the effect of structural uncertainties increases as the frequency increases. Deterministic modelling techniques such as finite element analysis are only suitable to model complex structures at low frequencies. Furthermore, FEA cannot easily account for uncertainty or randomness in structural parameters. High frequency dynamic predictive techniques such as Statistical Energy Analysis can account for structural uncertainty but is limited to structures with high modal density. There exists a frequency range between the two methods in which neither technique can be applied with great confidence. The objective of this thesis is to investigate predictive techniques for mid frequency vibration analysis of dynamic systems with structural uncertainties.  The first part of this work is to numerically characterise the effect of a range of uncertainties on the modal statistics of structures. The degree of uncertainty required to achieve universality of the statistical properties is investigated. This is achieved by examining the modal statistics of dynamic systems with a range of uncertainty, corresponding to uncertainty due to mass and stiffness perturbations, uncertainty at the boundaries of a structure, uncertainty in the coupling between structures, uncertainty in the material properties of a structure and uncertainty in the geometry of a structure. Several structures are examined corresponding to a plate with masses and/or linear springs added at random locations, a plate with torsional springs attached at random locations along its boundary edges, two plates coupled by linear springs at random locations, a mass-loaded coupled L-shaped plate, a mass-loaded frame-plate structure, and a plate with varying Young's modulus, density and thickness. The natural frequencies of the aforementioned structures have been derived using either the Lagrange-Rayleigh-Ritz technique, finite element analysis, or the use of interval analysis in conjunction with FEA.  The natural frequency statistics of structures with uncertain properties are observed using two statistical measures; the statistical overlap factor and the probability density function of the spacing between successive natural frequencies. The statistical overlap factor is defined by the variation in a natural frequency from its mean value measured across an ensemble of nominally identical structures with uncertainty. For a single ensemble member, the probability density function of the spacing between successive natural frequencies is compared to a Rayleigh distribution of the mean frequency spacing. A Rayleigh distribution of modal spacings is a feature of the universality exhibited by structures with uncertainty. To further investigate the effect of structural uncertainty on the vibrational characteristics of structures, the interval analysis is applied to finite element models of a plate with uncertainty in its material properties and dimensions. Using this method, the Young's modulus, density and thickness of a rectangular plate were set to vary by a small amount within predefined bounds. Using finite element equations, the natural frequencies and modeshapes of the structure were then determined in terms of the Young's modulus, density and plate thickness. For the mass and spring loaded plates, the springs were shown to affect the lower order modes while the masses had a significant effect on the higher order modes. As the frequency increased, only a small amount of perturbation was sufficient to affect the natural frequencies of a structure. Using the interval analysis method, the variation of the natural frequencies from their deterministic value increased as the frequency increased.  An ergodic hypothesis was used to examine the responses statistics of structures with uncertainty. Three structures have been computationally studied corresponding to two plates coupled by springs, an L-shaped plate and a frame plate structure. Uncertainty has been generated for the two coupled plates by locating the springs randomly across the surface of the two plates. For the L-shaped plate and a frame plate structure, uncertainty was generated by randomly positioning small masses across the plates. Using the ergodic hypothesis, the frequency averaged response on one member of an ensemble is compare with the ensemble averaged response. It was found that the ensemble averaged response was well predicted by a frequency averaged response of a single ensemble member. The width of the frequency averaging band was shown to have a large influence on the quality of the match between the frequency and ensemble averaged responses. Results were significantly improved using a frequency averaging bandwidth which varies proportionally to frequency.  Finally, experiments have been conducted on an L-shaped plate, a frame plate structure and a vehicle to validate the computational results for the natural frequency and response statistics.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mid frequency.</field><field name="subject">Vibration.</field><field name="subject">Uncertainty.</field><field name="subject">Dynamics -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Integrated Wind Erosion Modelling System with Emphasis on Dust Emission and Transport</field><field name="creator">Lu, Hua, Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, an integrated wind erosion assessment and prediction system has been developed. This system couples a physically based dust emission scheme, a high resolution limited area weather prediction model, a dust transport model, and a high resolution GIS (Geographic Information System) database.  A simple expression for particle threshold velocity has been derived by considering the force balance of a single particle resting on the surface. Theoretical analyses have been performed to confirm that the main mechanism for dust uplifting is sand saltation bombardment rather than direct aerodynamic entrainment. A new model for dust emission by saltation bombardment is proposed and validated against experimental data. Preliminary sensitivity tests for the new dust emission model have been carried out by examining the dependence of dust emission rate on a range of parameters.  The transport of airborne dust is modelled by using the particle mean concentration equation. The time-dependent advection terms are discretized and solved numerically by a multi-dimensional wave-propagation slope-limiter scheme. Some computational features of the integrated model are discussed in terms of its coupling, module decomposition, data handling and efficiency. A systematic sub-grid treatment is designed to extract soil surface parameters from the GIS database for large scale modelling.  The integrated system is applied to investigate the February 1996 dust storms over the Australia continent. The simulated wind erosion pattern and intensity are in good agreement with available meteorological records and satellite images. It reveals that the system can be used to identify areas and periods under wind erosion threat as well as the responsible environmental factors.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wind Erosion</field><field name="subject">Dust Emission</field><field name="subject">Dust Transport</field><field name="subject">Modelling</field><field name="subject">Integrated System.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17476</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The adoption of discrete event simulation in manufacturing management</field><field name="creator">Jenkins, Roger J.</field><field name="description">The research described in this thesis is aimed to improve our knowledge of barriers to the use of OR (Operations Research) techniques in the manufacturing sector.

Platinum-based drugs such as cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) and its anolgue, carboplatin, are the most effective chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of testicular, ovarian, bladder and lung cancers. Nevertheless, the emergence of toxic side-effects compromises its clinical effectiveness. It is generally agreed that most of the toxic effects of platinum-based drugs arise from their lack of selectivity.

It draws on the author's experiences in Singapore and his observations as a student living in Sydney. Museum exhibition designers are servants of the state. They help create public culture and promote a version of history. But if one is to understand the ways in which designers create meaning (and serve their employer's interests) we need to identify the 'vocabulary' and 'grammar' that they have at their disposal. To this end, the thesis outlines the variables that they work with and argues that they need to understand their employer's ideologies and history. The design vocabulary and grammar that the exhibition designer works with to create meaning in bridging understanding needs to be commensurate with the knowledge of history and the primary ideologies of the state which he/she serves. Singapore's recent interest in arts and heritage museums as part of a larger desire for regional economic and cultural survival and pre-eminence needs to be identified with the evolution, interconnectedness and ambitions of Singapore's arts and cultural organisations. In conjunction, some of the implications of Singapore's Arts and Heritage Policy need to be unpacked. A brief but concise comparative history of Sydney, Australia is made for the arts, cultural and museum comparison between Australia and Singapore. The exhibition designer's vocabulary and grammar can then be used to evaluate four exhibitions in Sydney and Singapore. This dissertation addresses the issues of 'Asian-ness' , modernisation without westernisation and the state's desire to meet the challenges which global communication systems place upon Singapore citizen's welfare.

Current solutions for searching image data primarily deal with associated text and low-level image features. Humans tend to use high-level concepts in everyday life; user queries are typically based on higher-level semantics and not low-level image features. However, what current computer vision techniques can automatically extract from images are mostly low-level visual features. To narrow down this semantic gap, some off-line and on-line processing is needed. The state-of-the-art image retrieval approach is to incorporate image semantics with low-level visual primitives to enhance the retrieval performance. Unfortunately the current mainstream of the image retrieval technologies in most web search engines is keyword-based retrieval; they have not explored the full potential of semantics of an image through effective use of its nearby text. Therefore I propose an image retrieval system that captures semantics of an image through effective use of its associated text and use integrated system architecture for keyword-based retrieval with low-level image features to enhance retrieval of images on the web. I have developed a new image retrieval system that enhances retrieval of images on the web through optimum. I conducted a preliminary study on collection of images obtained from HTML documents on the web. Based on my findings on text associated with the image, I have identified the textual contents of page title, image title, image alternate text, image caption and Meta tags are well related to an embedded image. These keywords lists have different significance in identifying the image semantics. I comparatively evaluate the performance of each keyword list exclusively to study their impact on overall retrieval effectiveness. The major contribution of my work included a full-scale development and implementation of the new image retrieval system I-Search. The system was based on an enhanced image representation that exploits the vast power of image semantics from the text associated with the images and higher-level semantic categories based on low-level image features of the images. The user-interface was designed to allow the user to communicate keywords based query and semantic categories to the image retrieval system. The performance of this new image retrieval system I-Search was compared with GoogleTM and YahooTM. Our analysis of this experiment confirmed that the integration of text associated with an image and low-level image features will lead to efficient retrieval system for content-based indexing of images on the web and will in fact substantially enhance the image searching capabilities on the web.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information storage and retrieval systems</field><field name="subject">image processing</field><field name="subject">digital retrieval</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/14187</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing soy-wheat bread-making properties using physically-modified soy flour</field><field name="creator">Maforimbo, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Soy enhances the protein quality of wheat bread because of its lysine content which is deficient in wheat. The aim of this work was to use high levels of soy flour in wheat bread in order to maximise the potential of soy flour protein in an attempt to address Protein Energy Malnutrition in developing counties. Raw soy flour (RSF) and physically modified soy flours (PMSF1 and PMSF2) were used for the preparation of the composite dough with wheat flour. The two physically modified soy flours were prepared by steam flushing (PMSF2) and water boiling (PMSF1) of raw soy beans before flour preparation. Physical modification of soy flour was chosen over chemical modification because of its practical significance in developing countries. The Farinograph and Extensograph were used to study the effect of Lascorbic acid and physical modification of soy flour on the rheological properties of soy-wheat composite doughs at various ratios up to 50% soy flour. Soy-wheat composite doughs made from physically modified soy flour (PMSF) exhibited higher resistance to extension (Rm), greater tolerance to mixing, better mixing stability, higher water uptake rate and water absorption than the soy-wheat composite doughs made from raw soy flour (RSF).The physical modification process provides a relatively simple method for improving the baking quality of soy flour, in combination with wheat flour, for use at the village level in regions where soy can be grown and where wheat grain is imported. Using physically modified soy flour (PMSF2) to prepare soy-wheat dough, a mathematical model was developed from estimated regression coefficients of L-ascorbic acid and water percentages (30% w/w soy flour) on soy-wheat dough DSC water evaporation enthalpies. The model was successfully used for the prediction of loaf volumes and for the formulation of soy-wheat breads. A daily serving of 100 to 200 grams of this bread was calculated to provide 60 -100% of the lysine and protein requirements (FAO/WHO) of children and adults.

The main compound of this material has been shown to be the potassium analogue of struvite, in which potassium ion is substituted for the ammonium ion. The cement is formed by reacting a slurry made with potassium carbonate and monoammonium phosphate with magnesium oxide. Ihe amount and rate of addition of water to the mixture is controlled to determine the set time. It has been demonstrated that this cement may be used as a matrix in conjunction with cenospheres or cellulose fibres to form a low density composite material, and with silica powder to form a high strength composite. As well as optimising the cement mix for maximum strength and minimum shrinkage, a variety of properties of the K-cement were investigated. It was found that long term exposure of the cement to the atmosphere does not result in the formation of magnesium carbonate, but long term exposure to saline solutions can result in the formation of dypingite on the surface. No effect on strength was observed as a consequence of the age of the slurry or the cement, within 1-2 weeks</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">potassium</field><field name="subject">struvite</field><field name="subject">cement</field><field name="subject">strength</field><field name="subject">ion</field><field name="subject">cellulose</field><field name="subject">shrinkage</field><field name="subject">silica powder</field><field name="subject">chemical bonds</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/282</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nursing homes : the experience of wives who remain in the community</field><field name="creator">Brown, Lynne M.</field><field name="description">Many older couples face the dilemma of one of them developing an illness that results in their ability to cope with everyday living activities. The well spouse may struggle for many years with an increasing workload, both physical and mental. Ultimately, there may come a time, when nursing home placement becomes necessary. The aim of this research was to find out what the experience was like for the wife, with a husband who is ill and faces placement in a nursing home, and to determine whether nurses could do more to help them to cope with this difficult situation. Following ethics approval, nine wives were interviewed over a period of two years. Each of the experience was unique, but there were some common problems that many of the wives mentioned. Loneliness was considered by most of the wives as being extremely upsetting, even when they were living with other people, for example their children. The absence of their partner and long term confident was noticed particularly in the evening when, in the past, they had sat down together and watched television. Other reactions included guilt, grief, depression and a change in the husband/wife relationship. Many of the wives seemed to accept the situation, realising that they could no longer cope with their husband at home, they were also healthier than they had been when their husband was at home. This research has highlighted some important points when a wife finds herself in the situation of having to place her husband in a nursing home, although nurses are unable to assist with many of the effects on the wife of the placement, it is helpful to know that the friendliness of the staff, the care of the patient and the cleanliness and homeliness of the nursing home are helpful at this time</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older couples</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">mental</field><field name="subject">physical</field><field name="subject">nursing home</field><field name="subject">loneliness</field><field name="subject">guilt</field><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">nursing staff</field><field name="subject">care</field><field name="subject">patient</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/288</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The beginnings of love : development of the prenatal relationship</field><field name="creator">Bartlett, Francine Claire</field><field name="description">This thesis weaves together disparate sources of theoretical knowledge with the lived experience of 11 women to illuminate the mysterious world of pre-natal relating - the foundation for postnatal life and the beginnings of the capacity to love. Love and supportive relationships can ameliorate stress and trauma post-birth, but do they operate prenatally, and if so how? This research clearly shows that mothers relate to their preborns and from the rich detail of their stories, the author proposes a schema that captures the complexity and changing nature of prenatal relating. The basic physiological and neurological structures are formed from conception, making the preborn vulnerable to the effects of direct and maternal experience. Preborns have extensive capacities that include the potential for interaction. These capacities and experiences affect infant development post birth. This evidence supports the author's initial hypothesis that prenatal stress is a significant factor in the attentional and behavioural problems of childhood, and challenges purely genetic explanations. 'Normal' life events have greater potency during pregnancy, making the transition to parenthood stressful even for many women in low risk situations. Feeling supported is essential for the health and well-being of the mother and preborn. This thesis reports a phenomenological and prospective study of 11 pregnant women as they lived the prenatal journey. From the interviews, it describes the development of the prenatal relationship and the range of stressful and supportive factors that should be considered in the creation of child and family friendly communities.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">preborn</field><field name="subject">prenatal</field><field name="subject">postnatal</field><field name="subject">love</field><field name="subject">baby</field><field name="subject">infant</field><field name="subject">mother</field><field name="subject">pregnancy</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">conception</field><field name="subject">birth</field><field name="subject">relating</field><field name="subject">parenting</field><field name="subject">foetus</field><field name="subject">partner</field><field name="subject">childhood</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patient and nurse collaboration in decision-making concerning long-term management of a newly formed colostomy</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Julia Mary</field><field name="description">This study included three projects which investigated aspects of decision-making in a nursing context.

This exegesis attempts to answer this by establishing the important role intuitive knowledge plays in decision making in general, and within the author's own art practice specifically. The study reviews some of the literature on intuition from philosophical and psychological perspective in order to validate intuitive knowledge and intuitive decision making within contemporary art practice. However, just because intuition may drive the process, it does not mean that the product of intuitive practice is necessarily good or has any value. Consequently, the importance of aesthetics, and the values of integrity, honesty and truth are explored from a philosophical perspective. These are discussed in relation to the art practice of other artists from this century as well as that of the writer. Having constructed a philosophical framework to work within and be guided by, the final part of this study documents the development of the practical work and how this framework influences the art practice and the outcomes of that practice. It is hoped that the results of the study will reassert the validity and relevance of this form of art practice and philosophy within contemporary art practice.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian painting (20th century)</field><field name="subject">intuition</field><field name="subject">artistic creativity</field><field name="subject">creativity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Perception of complex odour mixtures by humans</field><field name="creator">Jinks, Anthony L.</field><field name="description">In two parts, this thesis examined the perception of odour mixtures by humans.

Other peripheral mechanisms, central factors and limitations in human cognitive processing would also appear to play an important role.Taking into account the temporal processing results found in Part 1, Part 2 sought to establish the capacity of humans to analyse odour mixtures in greater than two components in terms of the perceived order of components, and the identity of those components. Overall, the research demonstrated that two properties of simple binary odour mixtures, namely the temporal order and perceived strengths of components, are not primarily characterised by the transduction pathway those components putatively operate in human ORNs.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">smell in humans</field><field name="subject">odour</field><field name="subject">binary odour</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Martin Heidegger: art and technology</field><field name="creator">Blackwell, Kerry J.</field><field name="description">An artists's approach to studio practice reflects knowledge acquired from a variety of source. Various methods are tried, modified, and re-interpreted, culmination in a studio practice that reflects one's own understanding of process and work ethic. This process is the work and the work practice concealed in the artwork, is rarely framed in verbal language. Martin Heidegger offers a particular philosophy of work practice that is clarified in words, allowing me to place my present understanding of studio practice within the notion of Greek techne. This essay is an explication of two works by the German philosopher Martin Heidegger, namely 'The Question Concerning Technology' and 'The origin of the Work of Art.' Heidegger's notion of authentic production and truth in art, provide a contextual framework within which I place my own understanding of studio practice and creative process. This method of work practice positions the artist as facilitator, co-dependent and co-responsible with the materials and form. The artist responds to the needs of the work allowing the materials and form to interact and ultimately reveal the work's true identity. Inherent in this work practice is the artist's knowledge, technical skill and commitment to process rather than outcome. This method of work practice is used in many cultures, from eastern calligraphy to western action painting, and has influenced contemporary artists too numerous to name individually.

A broad political economic approach is employed that considers relevant social structures, their effects, and working class women&#8217;s responses to them. It includes investigation of material and non-material, subjective and objective, aspects of this dialectical relationship. This study argues the political agency of Australian working class women has rarely been acknowledged, let alone understood. The thesis focuses on working class women in the suburbs and their politics of everyday life. Though these women rarely attract political investigation, they are too often assumed to be passive, apathetic, unenlightened or conservative bearers of oppression. These stereotypes persist despite the variability in historical portrayals of working class women, suggesting working class women&#8217;s politics only makes sense in the context of their conditions of existence in specific times and places. The thesis makes a contribution towards the field of applied feminist political economy research. It employs a historical materialist approach to demystify working class women&#8217;s politics. The empirical heart of the project draws on in-depth interviews with local working class women about their experiences and views of family, community, politics, work, unemployment and social institutions. This qualitative material is set against a detailed local political economic analysis of contemporary Campbelltown. The interconnections of capitalist and non-capitalist modes of production in which working class women labour, survive and resist are explored. The thesis questions what part capitalism and socialism play in their pursuit of self and social emancipation. Understanding the political economy of working class women is fundamental to social and ecological health and sustainability. Questions of class power and conflict, and gendered distributions of work and poverty locate working class women at the core of these pressing concerns. The central hypothesis of this study is that working class women are engaged in a wealth of political strategies stemming from their everyday bid for survival. Their (often contradictory) collective and self-activity coalesces around a politics antithetical to the logic of capitalism because it depends on their exploitation and immiseration for its viability. Working class women practice and reproduce a politics of survival and hope that informs their hidden worlds of resistance.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">employment</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Western Sydney</field><field name="subject">employment (economic theory)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/24900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selective oxidation of adamantane by metal complexes</field><field name="creator">RaviJayaKumar, K.</field><field name="description">A series of tri-substituted iron and cobalt complexes of the form [M(A)3]n+ were synthesized, and were characterised by UV/Visible absorption and 1H-NMR spectroscopy.

Spectroscopy further showed that these species cannot be prepared by the literature methods. The complexes were tested in the oxidation of adamantane in the solvents, acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid and they all oxidised adamantane to a mixture of 1-adamantanol, 1-adamantanol and 2-adamantanone both in the presence and the absence of the oxidant, O2. In all the reactions, however, the yield of conversion was very low. The mechanism for this oxidation was different depending on the presence or absence of O2. In the presence of O2 a catalytic cycle was produced for the oxidation of adamantine. In the oxidation in the presence and absence of O2 there was little variation in activity between the tri-substituted iron and cobalt complexes of 1,10-phenanthroline when compared with the analgous 2,2&#8217;-bipyridine complexes.

The breaking down of the poles between mind and body has stimulated a range of debates about subjectivity, desire, and knowledge. The body viewed as an anatomical specimen in the history of Western culture fails to acknowledge the corporeal other, it also does not acknowledge the way in which it has been constructed in a framework based on masculine desire and knowledge. This dissertation explores the profiles of the psychological 'body image' as a pathway to two different conceptual frameworks about the body. Firstly by using vision as a mode of investigating the relationship between the corporeal gendered 'self' and the anatomical other in Western culture. Then using the conceptual understanding of the 'body image' to extend beyond the limits of vision to a vaporous, more ethereal account of self. This concept blurs the edges of the corporeal self by using the olfactory as the basis for crossing the 'unseen' boundaries of body space and subjectivity.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anatomical</field><field name="subject">body</field><field name="subject">psychological</field><field name="subject">Western culture</field><field name="subject">corporeal</field><field name="subject">space</field><field name="subject">subjectivity</field><field name="subject">desire</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="subject">gendered</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/373</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between organization characteristics and needs for management training in developing countries</field><field name="creator">Hau, Le Nguyen</field><field name="description">Management training has been considered as an important issue attracting the interest of several individuals and organizations in both developed and developing countries. Moreover, empirical evidence shows that there are differences in many aspects of management training that may result from different features of organizations and countries concerned. However, there has been little research on the relationships between organizational characteristics and the need for management training, especially in developing countries. An understanding of these relationships will not only help organizations in developing their human resources but also help training suppliers in their marketing strategies. This research attempts to take a first step towards integrating theories and empirical findings into a conceptual framework that describes the above-mentioned relationship in developing countries. In particular, the research identifies and tests the impact of particular organizational indicators on the needs for training of task-related and people-related skills for both upper and lower managers. The results confirm that types of industry, technological characteristics, ownership, organizational structure, size and business environment, etc., are among variables explaining the training needs of various kinds in a company. The results would also provide regression models as tools in assessing training needs for management skills at various companies. However, it is the perceived needs rather than the real needs that is the concern of trainers, because perceptions lead to action, i.e., their business opportunities. Lastly, the direction for further studies is proposed, including the impact of macro variables, featured for developed and developing countries, and of variables that interfere with the process of transferring from real needs to perceived needs</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">training</field><field name="subject">skills</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">organization</field><field name="subject">relationship</field><field name="subject">variables</field><field name="subject">developing countries</field><field name="subject">structure</field><field name="subject">ownership</field><field name="subject">needs</field><field name="subject">company</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Skin to work : shifting materialities, ambiguous boundaries</field><field name="creator">Archer, Carol</field><field name="description">This thesis challenges existing readings of paintings by Alberto Burri which discuss the work in relation to matter or the body or the psyche.

In recent times, writers of the mythopoetic/therapeutic wing of the Men's Movement have advanced gender politicised notions of the Wild Man, assigning a role for him as a key to many of the problems men face. This new role intrigued me but their depiction of the Wild Man irritated because I too had a strong belief in him but felt he was being misrepresented. The objective of this thesis is to arrive at my own considered view of the Wild Man through assessment of the relevant data. The primary focus is on recent Men's Movement writing, both those championing the wild Man such as Bly, Keen and Biddulph, and their critics, who deny his existence. Feminist views are also an important area of investigation. The scope of investigation must include historical perspective of the Wild Man and evidence from the physical sciences, anthropology, zoology, psychology, philosophy, literature and sociology. I also examine the connections with my own field, visual arts linked with the Wild Man. During the conduct of the research, the author experimented with some of the methods for 'contacting the Wild Man' such as meditation and bushwalking. The written research was part of a cycle of investigation including the production of drawings and sculptures/installation, with each area nourishing and stimulating others. My assessment discusses and makes suggestions for: the Wild Man as a way for men to refashion themselves; men's 'contact' with the Wild Man; what the Wild Man has to offer; an exploration of the nature of the Wild Man; and his relevance to art.

The questions are raised : 1/. What are the vital factors of technological artworks? 2/. What sorts of methods can make using technology in arts more effective? 3/. How to overcome the difficulties in getting an intimate relationship between viewers and technological artworks? In order to optimise the aesthetic use of technology in art, the research is thus focused on 'naturalising' technology as a possible solution to overcome the negative aspects of technological artworks through the application of the theory of Yin-Yang O-Hang.Throughout this research, the author has discussed the fundamental concerns of the theory and its applications in Western and Eastern art. Furthermore, in investigating a number of artworks, the trends have been explored in technological art which are compatible with nature and humanity.

This thesis explores the social construction of the older woman's body both as abject and as 'docile/useful' and proposes how this abjectification can be re-inscribed as transgressive through a de-territorialization of the older woman's body.This thesis positions the older woman's body as (un)becoming because it lacks cultural intelligibility as representative of the feminine on the one hand and, on the other, because it disrupts normative ideals of femininity and eludes disciplinary practices. Sexuality is used as a resource to conjure, construct, reinforce and validate the 'ideal' woman, a model against which the older woman is redefined as asexual. I argue that the particular technologies employed in the production of the older woman's 'docile/useful' body are those of the health sciences. A 'docile/useful' body transforms the older woman into a knowable, treatable and profitable body through discourses of health. Mass mammographic screening is analysed in order to illustrate how the biomedical sciences are employed in the regulation of the older woman's body through the co-option of health promotion strategy as a disciplinary practice.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older woman</field><field name="subject">body</field><field name="subject">docile</field><field name="subject">sexuality</field><field name="subject">feminine</field><field name="subject">mammographic</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">assexual</field><field name="subject">screening</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cadmium effects on vegetables : production, physiology and biochemistry</field><field name="creator">Jinadasa, N.</field><field name="description">Cadmium (Cd) is absorbed through the lungs and the digestive tract; however, for most human non-smokers, the major route of Cd entry into the body is by ingestion. Perhaps 5% of ingested Cd is absorbed and once absorbed, Cd accumulates mostly in the liver and kidneys, where it can cause a variety of health problems. This applies equally to grazing stock. The major entry point of Cd into the food chain is therefore uptakes of traces of Cd by crop plants. This thesis focuses on Cd in vegetables. The study was conducted in an Australian context, where geogenic Cd contributions to soils are typically low. Most of the Cd in soils on Australian vegetable farms originates from materials added to boost crop production. Phosphate fertilisers were and remain the dominant Cd source. Most Australian soils are P-deficient and high rates of P fertiliser are essential for successful vegetable cropping. The P fertilisers used throughout Australia were formerly made from guano deposits mined on Pacific Islands. These contained high percentages of Cd. Current rock sources contain lower Cd concentrations. Studies showed that all the vegetable samples which contained excessive Cd concentrations were leafy vegetables, including cabbage, lettuce, silverbeet, parsley and bok choy. Cadmium impaired photosynthesis; reduced dry weight of the whole plant; slowed leaf elongation rate; decreased the length of fully expanded leaves; slowed the rate at which new leaves appeared; and altered foliar concentrations of Zn, Mn, Cu, Ca and S. These profound changes affected all parts of the plant; consequently, Cd did not affect the proportion of dry weight partitioned to the roots, stems and leaves.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cadmium</field><field name="subject">vegetables</field><field name="subject">toxicology</field><field name="subject">Cd absorption</field><field name="subject">fertiliser</field><field name="subject">P-fertiliser</field><field name="subject">soil</field><field name="subject">Cd concentration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An imaginary other</field><field name="creator">Andrews, Susan Lesley</field><field name="description">This research paper focuses on a specific period in western art history. The eighteenth and ninteenth centuries held fascination for the author as it marked the beginnings of modern science, a time when the artist and scientist collaborated in a mythical search for a key to unlock the mysterious realm to the unknown. The artist/scientist set on course to discover a new frontier thought to be buried somewhere in woman's body.The paper has been formulated into three chapters. The author has examined how the representation of the body of woman was reduced to a stereotype in both art and science. By examining eight images, she has sought to expose the subjective nature of the artists/anatomists' investigation during this period in history and reveal how art and science formed a complicit alliance in the misrepresentation of the body of woman.

Two procedures were used to determine detection thresholds and ability to discriminate between different concentrations of a tastant. These studies showed that male children had higher detection thresholds for sucrose and sodium chloride than adults and female children, whilst female children exhibited similar detection thresholds to adults. Both adults and children were able to classify the four common tastes according to their correct labels, and to discriminate between stimuli with the same dominant taste quality but the children were less successful. A ranking procedure was used to determine whether adults and children perceive binary taste mixtures similarly, and the results indicated that children were less successful. The ability of children and adults to use scaling procedures to estimate visual and non-visual stimuli was investigated, and it was found that children and adults had the same success at these tasks. Male and female children were found to have similar levels of maturity, with the exception of detection thresholds for sucrose and sodium chloride, indicating that their response characteristics are largely independent of gender. Overall, the results indicate that the sense of taste in mid-childhood is well developed, but some functions may not be mature</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">taste</field><field name="subject">taste in childhood</field><field name="subject">taste development</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/49</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characteristics and function of ion channels in the superior lacrimal gland of the rabbit</field><field name="creator">Herok, George Henryk</field><field name="description">The secretion of the acqueous component of tears is dependent on the uneven distribution and nature of ion channels across lacrimal gland acinar cell membranes. Models to describe such secretion in lacrimal glands are based primarily on one species, the rat and have been developed in conjunction with observations of channel function and secretion from salivary and pancreatic exocrine glands, which are structurally similar to lacrimal glands. The applicability of these models to all species is unknown and furthermore none takes into account volume regulation mechanisms in these acinar cells. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to broaden the basis for such models by identifying the major membrane ionic channels, characterising their mode of activation and determining their possible physiological roles in rabbit superior lacrimal gland acinar cells. Initially, a culture system for maintaining acinar cells for short and long terms was developed. This allowed for electrophysiological techniques to be employed to study the role of ionic channel activity in the secretion of the aqueous component of tears and cell volume regulation. This study demonstrates a number of unique findings and indicates that the models currently used to describe lacrimal gland secretion are not applicable to all species and need modifications which take into account cell volume regulation</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ion channels</field><field name="subject">lacrimal apparatus</field><field name="subject">rabbits</field><field name="subject">eye</field><field name="subject">secretion</field><field name="subject">tears</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/493</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of seascape spatial features on the fish and macroinvertebrates in seagrass beds</field><field name="creator">Jelbart, Jane E.</field><field name="description">Seagrass beds of Zostera capricorni are an integral part of the estuarine landscape along the east coast of Australia forming important habitats for juvenile fish and macroinvertebrates. Seagrass beds can vary in their spatial structural such as their size, shape and patchiness of seagrass cover. They can also be located within the estuarine landscape context such as their proximity to other habitats or their location within the estuary. The influence or correlation of these landscape or seascape spatial features of seagrass beds on the assemblages of seagrass fauna (fish and macroinvertebrates) was tested in this thesis. It was found that the spatial structure of seagrass beds (size and shape), their patchiness of the seagrass cover and location within the estuary (close or far from estuary mouth) were correlated with the assemblages of fish within seagrass beds. In particular it was demonstrated that there were greater densities of small fish species in the small compared to the large beds of Z. capricorni. This occurred regardless of the placement of the seagrass bed within the estuary context, its proximity to other habitats or patchiness of cover. Further experimentation using artificial seagrass patches demonstrated that this effect of patch size was independent of the perimeter length or perimeter to area ratio of the seagrass beds. It was hypothesised that the greater density of small fish species in small seagrass beds could be attributed to the greater proportion of edge habitats in small beds i.e. edge-mediated effects. However, the number of fish species per net haul in edges and inner regions of small and large seagrass beds were measured and found not to be different. The outcomes of this research suggest that to conserve the small fish species within an estuary, it is essential to protect even the small and patchy seagrass beds. A network of seagrass beds from all regions of the estuary is also required and the adjacent mangrove forests must be included</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">seagrasses Australia</field><field name="subject">estuarine ecology</field><field name="subject">estuarine animals</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/492</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inquiry into the appeal of anonymity to the artist</field><field name="creator">Earles, Bruce</field><field name="description">This paper, in conjunction with a series of paintings and drawings, attempts to outline the theme of anonymity.

The midwives practiced without any significant training in these therapies. Hospital policies were almost non existant in relation to the practice of complementary therapies and nurses often felt frustrated at not being able to implement complementary therapies. The main issues that emerged from the study were the need for education for the midwives related to specific complementary therapies, hospital policies conducive to the practice of complementary therapies and research into the efficacy of the different complementary therapies.

It consists of two types of text &#8211; theoretical and poetic. This thesis asks, for the purposes of a poetics of writing, what knowledge of language poetry requires. Questions as to the sources of poetry are resolved as questions asked of the ethics in which writing is possible. Poetry is that discourse which stands out of the bivalency of judgement, constituting, as speech does in its unending, the delay of freedom. Tropology is structure with which to represent the world, and by limitless tropology we inscribe the manner and scope of poetry&#8217;s indirection. What individuals negotiate among differends amounts to their own authenticity. The community of writing is made up of shifting personae whose roles blur between the work of making and the work of keeping the canon. Canon is to literature as langue is to parole &#8211; meta-awareness in the service of common sense. We, who make up this community, are constantly at the work of protecting and violating borders.

Value itself, becomes a recurring theme in these discussions since design and display within both institutions can perpetuate value, desire, and fetishism for the object.

D.</field><field name="description">Social, economic, and cultural changes in the 1970s brought about a level of anxiety as to what constituted masculine identity in an era of rising unemployment; diminishing paternal authority within the family; a feminising of the workplace accompanying technological development; and the insistence on 'equal rights' by homosexual, women's and racial minority groups. The feeling of panic that accompanied the rapid social change of the period was reflected in a body of mainstream American films that have come to categorise 'eighties cinema'. These films depicted a style of masculinity that centered on tough, muscular bodies; violence that was both sadistic and masochistic; sexuality that was simultaneously homophobic and homoerotic; patriarchy restored through a refigured father that incorporated the maternal; the creation of all-male worlds through the exclusion of the feminine; and a nostalgia for a stable masculine identity derived more from a fear of the future than a remembrance of the past. The representations of masculinity in these films can be seen as part of a New Right Movement, symptomatic of Reaganite values. The films can also be read as a postmodern play with the images of another generation, in an acting out of excessive cultural expectations. The movies' version of masculinity also offered a fantasy space, providing heroism and power as a counterpoint to dissatisfaction and impotence. In encompassing elements of all of these, a conservative role playing that offered the protection of fantasy and the fun of a game, the films functioned as masquerade. This group of films were a masculine masquerade, in that they were an enactment of a conservative version of masculinity that was a pleasurable game of excess, and at the same time a defence against anxiety in the face of changing social patterns. The masquerade disguised as a quest for the phallus, hiding both the desire, and the refusal, to renounce masculine social power</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">sexuality</field><field name="subject">patriarchy</field><field name="subject">social power</field><field name="subject">Reaganite</field><field name="subject">machismo</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reel madness : the representation of madness in popular western film</field><field name="creator">Welch, Mark</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the representation of madness in popular film, in the main from the Western canon and English speaking, and argues that madness is seen and represented as an extreme of human experience, a form of Otherness, which throws into relief notions of ontology, sanity and personal and cultural identity. It progresses from a consideration of the historical representations of madness and sanity in art and literature to a review of the pertinent literature on cinema and representation, and uses seminal examples from throughout cinematic history mostly from English language films, from 1906-1996, to illustrate the argument. Alternative methodological approaches are considered for the insights they may provide, and also for the contribution they make to the development of the thesis, in particular the influence of semiotics. A number of stereotypical portrayals of madness, such as the 'mad scientist', the 'crazed murderer', and the 'doomed heroic outsider' are examined in detail. Finally, the thesis proposes the way madness, and mad people, are represented in popular film is reflective and indicative of social and cultural concerns over what can be known, how identity can be established and what it means to live in the contemporary world fraught with uncertainty, anxiety and change</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mental illness</field><field name="subject">art and mental illness</field><field name="subject">psychiatry in art</field><field name="subject">motion pictures (social aspects)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-framing : an investigation of performance at the intersection of space</field><field name="creator">Tuttle, Dean</field><field name="description">Re-framing is the documentation and analysis of a process of theoretical and practical performance research. The terms of reference for this research were to experiment with the practical workshopping and development of three productions which each restructured and reconceived a 'canonical' written playscript in a format which combined audio-visual media with live performance. The perfromances were specifically developed for highschools in New South Wales and developed models and ideas for using portable technology so that they could easily travel from location to location. The research methodology also included the practical investigation of a process of collaborative production of a multimedia theatre piece with a group of highschool students (from Plumpton High School in Western Sydney). The documentation consists of an interactive multimedia component and a number of text 'modules' that correspond to sections of the interactive. The analysis formulates the process of construction, execution and reception of the performances in terms of a number of interesting and interacting spaces. The focus is on the practice and effects of creating combinations and interactions between these otherwise discreet spaces. The nature of these spaces helps to define and situate the performance but the space can, conversely, be redefined by the performance. In the specific context of multimedia theatre performances for highschools, the spaces that may come into interplay and be modified include: those of the audio-visual media, the meeting space of live performer and audience, the school environment and the wider institution of public education that it is a part of, the written text of a playscript as a space for constructing a fictional reality and the 'virtual space' where this fiction is reconstructed within the mind of the spectator in response to the symbolism of the performance. If such spaces are bounded by frames which are at least partly socially and discursively defined, the thesis proposes, then the performance can act as a catalyst to create new spaces, with languages and ways of structuring reality that differ to those of the old spaces. The implications of this hybridisation may reach beyond the immediate time, space and subject of the performance to reframe ideas, images, narratives and mythologies in domains that extend into many areas of social life and destabilize the systems upon which they are based.

To learn more about the development of this syndrome, this thesis has examined the influence of root zone temperature (RZT) and genotype on the growth of peach rootstocks and the scions grafted onto them. Other factors that influence the quality of peach seedling rootstocks were also examined. Initial trials examined the influence of Okinawa (a low chill cultivar) and Golden Queen (a high chill cultivar)rootstocks on the expression of SSS. Studies found that multiple stems could originate from either multiple seeds within a single stone or from axils originating from the base of cotyledons. The incidence of both conditions was heavily influenced by variety, thus suggesting that an active selection program based on the elimination of these traits would be beneficial to the stone fruit nursery industry.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stone fruit industry, Australia</field><field name="subject">peach rootstocks</field><field name="subject">effect of climate on peaches</field><field name="subject">cold climate</field><field name="subject">root temperature</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between scientific understandings of voice and current practice in the teaching of singing in Australia</field><field name="creator">Callaghan, Jean</field><field name="description">Scientific knowledge of vocal function and vocal health has increased greatly in recent decades, with new technology capable of displaying the larynx in operation, measuring muscular effort, and acoustically analysing vocal sound. This research addresses five key questions: 1/. What is the current body of voice science knowledge relevant to singing? 2/. What do singing teaching practitioners currently know about the voice? 3/. How do practitioners' understandings of voice influence their teaching of vocal techniques? 4/. How does singing teaching in Australia relate to bel canto precepts? 5/. How does singing teaching in Australia relate to voice science? Data was collected from surveys conducted to answer these questions. Analysis of survey data indicates that practitioners see themselves less as teachers than as singers who teach, and that this role perception carries values that moderate voice knowledge and approaches to teaching. The implications of this conclusion for the professional training of singing teachers in Australia are discussed and suggestions made for further research. In particular, voice scientists and singing teachers need to collaborate more actively in research. Scientific research into singing would have broader application if a model appropriate to both male and female voices were utilised and if larger and better chosen selections of experimental subjects were used.

It is argued that the understanding of a work of art involves participation in its meaning by the audience which is not so much a mere receiver of information as a catalyst of the work's content. This Research Paper also attempts to place the three Research Projects, which when combined are entitled REMEMORIES/IMAGETEXTS, into a feminist remaking of history (in Barbara Kruger's sense), realigning the male-oriented histories with a female presence. Questioning the 'historical document' as the authority on history, and giving alternative versions of the life of Jeanne d'Arc and the life of Sarah Cox Wentworth are some of the concerns in the Research Projects. How these three Research Projects came to be linked is that each was originally exhibited during 1995 for the Twentieth Anniversary of International Women's Year, in venues from Penrith to Paddington. Their making spans many years, and in essence comes down to a fascination with the portrayal of women throughout history.That our images of women originally derived from how women were portrayed in carnival is one of the emerging themes, and that there are a number of different memories of specific events, depending on who is remembering them, and what their (hidden) agenda entails. In moving between time zones, questioning the portrayal of 'woman as sign', and subverting the traditional sign of woman, the artist puts forward the argument that women are the producers of signs and thus not merely objects as represented by signs</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">artistic photography</field><field name="subject">memory (philosophy)</field><field name="subject">carnival</field><field name="subject">modern art(20th Century)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representations of men and male identities in Australian mass media</field><field name="creator">Macnamara, Jim R.</field><field name="description">Gender has been identified as a key element of human identity.

Numerous studies have examined representations of women in mass media and argued that these have significant effects on women, on men, and on societies. A number of researchers have found that the treatment of men in mass media is not unproblematic and say that that feminist-led discourses have presented pictures of men as rapists, batterers, pornographers, child abusers, militarists, exploiters, and images of women as targets and victims. But studies of representations of men have been far fewer than those focussing on women.

Different methods for assessing performance have been proposed. In general, most measures were calculated as simple ratios such as food and labour cost per meal or limited parametric techniques such as regression analysis. These approaches are meaningful indicators of which operational performance areas require attentions; however, problems arise when managers interpret partial productivity measures of this type as indicators of overall performance without considering the effects of other related variables. This could create further problems in complex applications such as the health care foodservice sector where multiple inputs (number of full time employees, energy cost, capital, overheads) outputs (number of meals and patient satisfaction) and environmental or interfering variables (age of equipment, quality of labour or skill level of employees and the degree of readiness of materials) should be considered in the assessment of efficiency. This study contributes to overcoming these limitations by introducing the stochastic frontier approach to assess the efficiency of the health care foodservice sector. It is superior to the traditional productivity approaches as it allows for the integrations of multiple inputs and outputs in evaluating relative efficiencies. The overall objective of the study was to determine the level of cost, technical and allocative efficiency in a sample of health care foodservice operations. More specifically, the objective was pursued by estimating stochastic production and cost frontiers models, which provided the basis for measuring technical (TE), allocative (AE) and cost efficiency (CE). The factors that significantly contribute to increasing inefficiency in health care foodservice operations were also identified. In this way, this study has policy implications because it not only provided empirical measures of different efficiency indices, but also identifies some key variables that are correlated with these indices. It goes beyond much of the published literature concerning efficiency because most research in the area of efficiency analysis focuses exclusively on the measurement of technical and cost efficiency. The stochastic frontier approach was tested in a cross sectional data set from a sample of 101 health care foodservice operations in Australia and the USA. Results showed that the models and all the parameters coefficients were plausible, significant and satisfy all theoretical requirements. Further, results also showed that the average cost, technical and cost efficiency were around 70 percent, 80 percent and 88 percent respectively. These figures suggest that substantial gains in output and/or decreases in cost can be attained if hospital foodservice operations were to improve their current performance. Finally, the results indicated that an increase in the level of manager&#8217;s experience and the level of manager&#8217;s education could have a positive impact on decreasing the level of inefficiency in health care foodservice operations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hospitals</field><field name="subject">food service</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">health facilities</field><field name="subject">finance</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/39196</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing fortunes : past, present and future perspectives on the management of problem gambling by New South Wales registered clubs</field><field name="creator">Hing, Nerilee</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to examine, from past, present and future perspectives how registered clubs in New South Wales (NSW), Australia strategically manage problem gambling in their machine gambling operations.

This thesis proposes to investigate the possible need for changes in the practices of ministries in the church in Nigeria. The study aims to articulate a theology of ministry and to critically review the growth and development of ministries in the church from the beginnings of Christianity up to the mid-second century. It will also critically review the understanding of ministry in Vatican II and post-Vatican II documents, and describe and critically analyse the development of ministries in the Nigerian church before and after Vatican II. It will suggest a way forward in the broadening and diversifying of ministries in that country by suggesting ways in which the practice of ministry may be enhanced in the local churches in Nigeria. By local churches, this writer is referring particularly to small Catholic communities or rural out-stations of the church in Nigeria. Scope: The study is undertaken in five chapters with an introduction and conclusion. Chapter One considers the theological understanding of ministry at the present time; it explains the meaning of ministry and differentiates it from other concepts such as lay apostolate and Catholic Action; it posits baptism as the foundation for ministry and outlines a theology of ministry. Chapter Two traces the origin of ministry in the New Testament and its evolution in the early church. The findings of Chapter Two will be applied in Chapters Four and Five that concentrate on the church in Nigeria. Chapter Three focuses on the understanding of ministry at the Second Vatican Council and in post-conciliar documents. This chapter analyses and summarises the teachings in the documents concerning ministry, which will later be applied to the church in Nigeria. Chapter Four traces the development and organisation of ministry in Nigeria before and after Vatican II within the framework of chapters one to three. The chapter begins with a sketch history of the church in Nigeria and proceeds to highlight the present organisation of ministry in Nigeria. Chapter Five proposes a broadening and diversifying of ministries in the church in Nigeria. It considers the significance of the local communities and how a broadening and diversification of ministries would help the progress and growth of these communities. Conclusions: There has been a shift in the Catholic theology of ministry and the central idea in the theology of ministry is the church in which all members are participants in diverse ways in the various responsibilities of the community. The historical overview of the New Testament times highlighted the arrangement of ministries in the early church. Ministries existed according to the needs of the local community. The ministerial arrangement of the first century of the church was stifled by the emergence of the threefold ministry of bishops, priests and deacons. Vatican II offered the basis of a renewal for the church in matters of ministries. The Council presented a renewed understanding of the church in terms of mystery, Body of Christ, sacrament, communion and, above all, people of God. This new understanding of the church demands a new approach to ministries in the church. This study concludes that the communal dimension of the church stressed by the Council should prevail in Nigeria. The ordained ministry dominates in the church in Nigeria. In the local church situation, the catechist is looked upon as the spiritual leader of the community who collaborates with other members to meet the various needs of the community. These people are hardly literate, yet they provide the essential leadership that is needed for the community. But they are not able to lead the community in the Eucharist because they have not been given the power. From this we conclude that catechists should be empowered with ordination to the priesthood that will enable them more effectively to fulfil the pastoral responsibilities they already have. In the provision of a higher quality of ministry in rural churches, the ordination of catechists would playa big part. Other lay people should be allowed and encouraged to function as acolytes, lectors, eucharistic ministers and in other capacities in the local churches. The rapid growth of the church in Nigeria demands the emergence and encouragement of new ministries in parishes and out-stations to meet the needs of the people.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ministry</field><field name="subject">Nigeria</field><field name="subject">Catholic Church</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp202.03072009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the strength of the 52-week high momentum strategy in the United States : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the degree of Masters of Business Studies in Finance at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Cahan, Rachael Marie</field><field name="description">This thesis extends the 52-week high momentum literature, which was first published by George and Hwang in 2004, by stressing the parameters of the trading strategy to investigate its robustness. George and Hwang, in their seminal paper, find that the ratio of a stock&#8217;s close price to its 52-week high price is a good predictor of future returns. The thesis stresses various parameters of the strategy - such as the percent of total stocks bought and sold each period &#8211; and applies the strategy over different time periods &#8211; such as bull and bear markets. The study finds that the strategy is more profitable over the later half of the data set due to underperformance in bear markets such as the 1929 market crash and subsequent Great Depression. The results also show a significant difference in profitability between bull and bear market periods. The second half of the thesis looks at a new area in momentum, the absolute 52-week high. The strategy buys stocks whose price has increased over the previous six months, and who also close to their 52-week high price. Stocks are only bought (sold) if their price has increased (decreased) over the past six months and is close to (far from) the 52-week high price. The aim is to cut out stocks that are considered to be underperforming in the 52-week high momentum strategy, leaving only true winner and loser stocks. This strategy was found to increase the strength of the 52-week high momentum strategy, and the results show that there is no longer a significant difference between bull and bear market returns.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stock prices</field><field name="subject">bear market</field><field name="subject">bull market</field><field name="subject">52-week high momentum strategy</field><field name="subject">fifty-two-week high momentum strategy</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="subject">stock price predictions</field><field name="subject">trading strategy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350300 Banking, Finance and Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/891</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple perspectives on the education of mathematically gifted and talented students : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bicknell, Brenda Anne</field><field name="description">This study examines multiple perspectives on the education of a group of fifteen Year 6 and Year 8 students identified as mathematically gifted and talented. The students&#8217; mathematical experiences, both past and present are examined using evidence from school policy documents; student, teacher, and parent interviews; questionnaires; and classroom observations. The purpose of this case study was to seek understandings about awareness of the characteristics of mathematically gifted and talented students, the identification of and educational provisions for mathematically gifted and talented students, parental involvement, and school transfer. The group of fifteen students consisted of ten Year 6 students who transferred from primary school to a new school for Year 7, and five Year 8 students who moved to secondary schools for Year 9. These students had been identified by their school and teachers as gifted and talented in mathematics. This predominantly qualitative study is underpinned by an interpretive paradigm and influenced by a sociocultural philosophy of learning and teaching. The literature review presents the dilemmas, similarities, and differences that prevail in the field of gifted education. A more specific focus is given to the education of mathematically gifted students to highlight gaps in the field. This two-year study tracking a group of students provides a cohesive approach to understanding the educational provisions for students identified as mathematically gifted and talented in the New Zealand setting. The multiple case studies included interviews, questionnaires, documents, and observations. The research findings show that there is not a comprehensive understanding by schools and teachers about the characteristics of mathematically gifted students. Despite the documentation of a range of identification processes in school policies, a multiple method approach is not practised in many schools. Provision of appropriate programmes is variable and determined by factors such as school organization, identification, teacher knowledge and expertise, and resources. Parents play a key role in their children&#8217;s mathematics education as motivators, resource providers, monitors, mathematics content advisers, and mathematical learning advisers. Schools, teachers, parents, and peers all contribute to the success of a student&#8217;s transfer from one phase of schooling to another; they support a student&#8217;s social and emotional well being and influence curriculum continuity in mathematics. This study provides insights into the various determinants of the development of mathematical talent. For New Zealand schools and teachers, it provides evidence that understanding the characteristics of mathematical giftedness is important and that identification processes must reflect this understanding. Provisions must be well considered and evaluated; the role of parents should be understood and valued; and home-school communications strengthened. Together, all stakeholders share a critical role in the education of mathematically gifted and talented students.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gifted children</field><field name="subject">mathematics study and teaching</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330108 Special education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/890</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The usage of traditional Maori narratives as cognitive models and educational tools : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Social Anthropology at Massey University, Albany Campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Benavides, Sebastian Pelayo</field><field name="description">The present research consists of an interdisciplinary approach which combines mainly sub-disciplines from the anthropological and psychological perspectives as theoretical background.

The main objective of the study is to achieve a broad view on the use of traditional korero paki and korero o nehera (Maori folktales/legends and myths) as pedagogical tools and as cognitive models. The latter includes a bibliographical review which covers the analysis of narratives and their usage from different areas, such as Maori epistemology and education, cultural psychology and cognitive anthropology.

Therefore, the research analyses &#8211;based on semi-structured interviews- the perspectives and understanding of the usage of traditional Maori narratives as educational tools of scholars in the Maori studies/education field and of a sample of Maori teachers, most of them connected to a Kura Kaupapa Maori school, constituting a &#8220;study case&#8221; for this qualitative study. A period of complementary participant observation was also carried out, focusing on the pedagogical practises and styles of the participant teachers.

The chemical structure of DOTH is similar to a precursor of aflatoxin (AF) and sterigmatocystin (ST), which are secondary metabolites produced by Aspergillus species. A size fractionated genomic library was made and 11 putative DOTH genes were identified in P. arachidicola. The DOTH genes in P. arachidicola were compared to DOTH genes in D. septosporum as well as to AF and ST genes in Aspergillus species. The DOTH gene products in P. arachidicola showed 73 - 96% amino acid identity to DOTH genes in D. septosporum and 50 - 69% amino acid identity to AF/ST genes in Aspergillus. The DOTH biosynthesis genes in P. arachidicola had similar gene organization and direction of transcription to DOTH biosynthesis genes in D. septosporum and is similar in that 11 putative DOTH genes are separated into three mini-clusters. This differs from the AF/ST clusters in which 25 AF/ST genes are tightly clustered in a 70 kb region. Identification of transcription factor binding sites upstream of DOTH genes in P. arachidicola and D. septosporum suggested similar co-regulation of DOTH gene expression in P. arachidicola and D. septosporum. Tandem and inverted repeat sequences were identified in intergenic regions in the P. arachidicola DOTH gene cluster, but the distribution of those repeats appears to be random. This suggests that the fragmentation of the DOTH biosynthesis gene cluster is not due to retrotransposon activity or recombination between repeat sequences. The DOTH biosynthesis gene clusters in P. arachidicola and D. septosporum could be ancestral to AF/ST biosynthesis clusters in Aspergillus species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biosynthesis genes</field><field name="subject">peanut pathogen</field><field name="subject">pine needle pathogen</field><field name="subject">metabolites</field><field name="subject">Aspergillus</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270201 Gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/894</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritional characteristics of New Zealand export lamb and functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of technology in Bioprocess Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jansen, Eion</field><field name="description">Richmond Ltd. has recently undergone a change in strategy, away from the traditional commodity based meat industry, towards the modern food business. To do this, opportunities to add value to their current product range must be identified. This involves the conversion of traditionally low value commodity based products into products that demand a premium. An example of this is converting muscles that are currently used for grinding meat into a further processed convenience food (i.e. ready meals). Another method is to add further value to premium products by making them more appealing to consumers (i.e. nutritional information on labels). This work details investigations into the functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles (low value commodity products) and the nutritional properties of selected export lamb products (premium products). The functional properties of a number of beef forequarter muscles were measured to identify which had the best potential for further processing applications with respect to ready meals. The functional properties of tenderness, cook loss and shrinkage were measured for the Latissimus Dorsi, Pectorialis Profundus (Point End Brisket), Infraspinatus (Cross Cut Blade), Triceps Brachi Longhead (Main muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod), Supraspinatus (Chuck Tender), Serratus Ventralis and Triceps Brachi Medialhead (Muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod. From the tests conducted the Infraspinatus and the Triceps Brachi Longhead have been identified as having the best functional properties with respect to further processing for ready meal applications. As well as conducting tests to identify the forequarter muscles with the best potential for further processing applications, investigations were carried out to identify cooking regimes that would optimise the functional properties. This work confirmed that there are three major chemical reactions, which determine the resultant functional properties of cooked meat. They are the denaturation and aggregation of the myofibrillar proteins and the denaturation and solubilisation of connective tissue (collagen). At around 50&#176;C myosin (45% to 50% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in cook loss and reduction in water holding capacity. At around 60&#176;C collagen (main connective tissue protein) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in tenderness and increase in cook loss. This is because as the collagen denatures it loses it mechanical strength (increase in tenderness) and can no longer support its own structure, and causes it to contract. This contraction causes fluid within the meat and cook loss caused by the denaturation of myosin to be expelled from the meat by compressive forces (squeezed out). At around 70&#176;C actomyosin (22% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures. This results in a substantial increase in the cook loss and firming of the meat. The increase in cook loss or decrease in water holding capacity that occurs with myofibrillar protein denaturation is due to the fact that when these proteins denature and aggregate their ability to bind water is greatly reduced. From the results of the cooking regime trials it is recommended that for functional property considerations that during the cooking of further processed meat products (i.e. ready meal applications) a meat temperature of 62&#176;C should be aimed for, for the slowest heating region during cooking (usually the centre). This is because it has been identified that a cooking temperature of 65&#176;C should not be exceeded otherwise detrimental effects can occur to the functional properties of the cooked meat. For health concerns a 7D bacterial death reduction has to be achieved. This means that for a cooking temperature of 62&#176;C the meat has to be held at this temperature for at least 5 minutes. Therefore the total cooking time would be the time needed to heat all the meat to 62&#176;C plus 5 minutes to ensure a safe product. The heating or cooking system employed should also ensure that a minimal amount of the meat is heated above 65&#176;C. This can be easily achieved by minimising the external cooking temperature, but long cooking times will result. An industrial cooking process will be a compromise between the cost associated with longer residence time and product functionality. As mentioned earlier another way to add value is to supply nutritional information for selected cuts. Consequentially one of the objectives of this project was to provide some nutritional information for selected meat cuts. Though the primary objective of this part of the project was to develop a method for producing the needed information, so that Richmond N.Z. Ltd. can develop further information on an as needs basis. The nutritional characteristics of a number of export lamb cuts from the saddle region has also been investigated and a method devised to allow further characterisation of other cuts. The method involves breaking down a standard cut into its constituent components (e.g. Frenched rack consists of loin eye, fat cap, intercostals and fatty tissue). The constituent components are tested for their nutritional properties. The frenched rack nutritional properties are calculated from the nutritional properties of the constituents components and the yield data (percentage of each constituent component within a frenched rack) for frenched racks. This method allowed the identification of the main sources of variation for nutritional characteristics. These differences were found to be caused by the lean to fat ratio, not nutritional differences in lean tissue from the same region of lamb (i.e. loin eye and tenderloin very similar nutritionally). The difference in lean to fat ration also accounts for the variation between grades (i.e. PX grade lamb cuts have a higher fat content than YX grade lamb cuts due to PX grade cuts having a higher percentage fat tissue in their cuts). The cuts characterised were the shortloin section (whole section or chop), rack section (whole section or chop), 75mm racks frenched 25mm, boneless loin and tenderloin for both PX and YX grade lamb. The method will be applicable to other regions of lamb (i.e. hindquarter and forequarter) for which nutritional information already exists, but for which yielding data will have to be collected. The method would also be applicable to other species such as beef and venison, but both nutritional data for constituent components and yielding data would have to be collected.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infraspinatus</field><field name="subject">Triceps Brachi Longhead</field><field name="subject">ready meals</field><field name="subject">cooked meat</field><field name="subject">protein denaturation</field><field name="subject">nutritional properties</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/895</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient web-based application development tools on XML-enabled databases : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Information Sciences</field><field name="creator">Chen, Yi</field><field name="description">No abstract provided</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">web-based application development tools</field><field name="subject">web 2.0</field><field name="subject">XML</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280300 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/896</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acquisition of Japanese vocabulary by Chinese background learners: the roles of transfer in the productive and receptive acquisition of cognates and polysemy.</field><field name="creator">Kato, Toshihito, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">As is widely known, Japanese and Chinese not only share the common logo graphic orthography called ???kanji??? or ???hanzi??? respectively, but also share a number of kanji compounds as cognates, many of which share the same or similar meaning. The major objective of this dissertation is to investigate the roles of transfer and the difficulty in Chinese background learners??? (CBLs???) use and acquisition of Japanese kanji compounds and kanji words. In particular, under what condition and how CBLs transfer Chinese words into Japanese counterparts is investigated.  The results of a lexicality judgement test, an oral production test, and a translation test showed that acquisition of partially deceptive cognates, which share the same orthography with partly the same and partly different meanings, was often prolonged. It was also found that the difficulty of acquisition of partially deceptive cognates varied according to their cross-linguistic semantic condition and task type. In the oral production test, CBLs frequently used L1 words by adapting them into L2 phonology both successfully and unsuccessfully when they had no prior knowledge of the L2 counterparts. In addition, negative transfer was detected even when CBLs had a correct knowledge of the L2 word. The results of the translation test revealed that CBLs are liable to misinterpret the meaning of partially deceptive cognates when one of their meanings happens to make sense within the context. Additionally, it is suggested that CBLs might create different types of interlanguage depending upon the cross-linguistic semantic condition and relative frequency of the L2 input for each meaning of the partially deceptive cognates.  The transferability of polysemy was found to be constrained by prototype condition, learners??? existing L2 knowledge, and task type. While transferability correlated well with the perceived prototypicality of the L1 items in CBLs??? oral production, transfer was also at work for the less prototypical items in their comprehension task. The findings indicate that the transferability of Chinese words into their Japanese counterparts is constrained by multiple factors. Further, both positive and negative transfer influence CBLs??? production, comprehension, and interlanguage construction of Japanese vocabulary in a complex manner.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese language -- Acquisition</field><field name="subject">Japanese language -- Vocabulary</field><field name="subject">Japanese language -- Study and teaching -- Chinese speakers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physiology and psychophysics of vibrotactile sensation</field><field name="creator">Sahai, Vineet, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Response characteristics and tactile coding capacities of single neurons of the dorsal column nuclei (DCN), and the dorsal horn, in particular, neurons of the spinocervical tract (SCT), were investigated in anaesthetized cats. Purely dynamically-sensitive tactile neurons of the DCN could be divided into two classes, one associated with hair follicle afferent (HFA) input, the other with Pacinian corpuscle (PC) input. The HFA-related class was most sensitive to low-frequency (&amp;lt50 Hz) vibration, had phaselocked responses to vibration frequencies up to ~75 Hz and had a graded response output as a function of vibrotactile intensity changes. PC-related neurons had broader vibrotactile sensitivity, extending to ~300 Hz with tightest phaselocking between 50 and 200 Hz. The SCT neurons in the lumbar dorsal horn had tactile receptive fields on the hairy skin of the hindlimb and a very limited capacity to signal, in a graded way, the intensity parameter of the vibrotactile stimulus. Furthermore, because of their inability to respond on a cycle-by-cycle pattern at vibration frequencies above 5-10 Hz, these neurons were unable to provide any useful signal of vibration frequency beyond ~5-10 Hz, in contrast to DCN neurons. In the parallel human psychophysical study, the capacity for vibrotactile frequency detection and discrimination was examined in five subjects in glabrous and hairy skin. The vibrotactile detection threshold values obtained at four standard frequencies of 20, 50, 100 and 200 Hz were markedly higher on the hairy skin than on the glabrous skin. The discrimination task was examined by means of a two-alternative, forced-choice psychophysical procedure. Measures of the discriminable frequency increment (?????) and the Weber Fraction (????? / ??), revealed similar capacities for frequency discrimination at the two different skin sites at the standard frequencies of 20, 100 and 200 Hz, but an equivocal difference at 50 Hz. Cutaneous local anaesthesia in the dorsal forearm produced a marked impairment in vibrotactile detection and discrimination at the low frequencies of 20 and 50 Hz but little effect at higher frequencies, confirming that vibrotactile detection and discrimination in hairy skin depend upon superficial receptors at low vibrotactile frequencies, but depend on deep, probably Pacinian corpuscle receptors for high frequencies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vibration -- Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Vibration -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Touch -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Senses and sensation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Out of order: explorations in digital materiality</field><field name="creator">Ballard, Susan Patricia, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Digital art installation is the result of informatic materials entering gallery spaces and challenging the establishment of media forms. This thesis contends that the open, recursive and recombinatory process of looking at digital installation is in fact the result of noisy relations between information and the spatial temporal contexts of the art gallery. In order to focus on the processes of informatic materials within gallery spaces, this thesis identifies four key modulations of noise and materiality ? emergence, feedback, entropy and delay. I demonstrate how these impact on a range of recent digital installations by Australian and New Zealand artists. The lens of digital materiality shifts from an informational context into that of art history where it is found to highlight the systemic relationality of the installation. The thesis opens with a consideration of histories of media-specificity, and argues for a necessary separation of our concepts of media and materiality. This context provides a set of tools by which the remainder of the thesis investigates a range of digital material flows that are not tied to fixed media definitions. I draw on a range of theorists including Umberto Eco, Gilles Deleuze, Claude Shannon and Jack Burnham to further locate these material flows within two strands: experimental sound and information theory. This discussion forms the basis of the thesis? re-appraisal of media distinctions and highlights the complex relationship of informational materials to both sonic and visual histories. The second half of the thesis undertakes an appraisal of emergence, feedback, entropy and delay in specific works and suggests dimensionality, movement and duration as key determinants of the digital installation. These chapters demonstrate that what is at stake in digital installation is the viewer?s implicit role in the shifting relationships of digital materiality. Overall, this thesis presents a framework for emergent materiality in digital installation. I develop a theory of emergent materiality as a process specific to digital installation, and argue that digital installation is in fact a subject-forming assemblage of information-noise in which relations of dimensionality, movement and duration coalesce without cohering.

She is widely recognised as having made significant contributions to the development of Australian musical composition and contemporary creative life. While a significant body of scholarly work has been completed on Sutherland and while it is varied in scope and purpose, to date, no study has been undertaken with a strong focus on the identification and examination of primary sources relating to Sutherland. Research on Sutherland and her creative life has been consistently hampered by problems such as numerous lacunae in the composer???s corpus of works and the transmission of errors from one study to the next. It is the thesis of this study that these problems can be addressed by a reevaluation of all previously-used primary documents as well as the study of newlyfound primary source material: returning to primary sources has uncovered a considerable amount of material, both by and about the composer, which has remained previously unexplored. In order to address omissions in Sutherland???s work list, the starting point for the current study is the compilation of a thorough catalogue of works which incorporates all known compositions by Sutherland. This catalogue is derived from the collation of comprehensive primary source material. Further to this, the close examination of extensive primary sources relating to Sutherland???s life and music provides insights into aspects of the contemporary musical network in which she worked and also into the particular problems she encountered as a female composer in a geographically isolated country. The diversity of her achievements is also illuminated. The resources used in this thesis provide the material which will enhance, augment, and sometimes offer new perspectives relating to the current understanding of Sutherland???s creative life. Thus, Sutherland???s contribution to Australian music can be more deeply understood.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women composers - Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Debridement Of Subgingival Periodontally Involved Root Surfaces With A Micro-Applicator Brush: A Macroscopic And Scanning Electron Microscope Study</field><field name="creator">Carey, Helen</field><field name="description">Master of Science in Dentistry</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Periodontics</field><field name="subject">Teeth -- Roots -- Planing</field><field name="subject">Dental scaling</field><field name="subject">Gums -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">Dental plaque</field><field name="subject">Debridement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Guided Bone Regeneration Around Titanium Implants</field><field name="creator">Pal, George L.</field><field name="description">Master of Science in Dentistry</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">implants</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hypnosis In Clinical Dentistry</field><field name="creator">Benson, Peter E.</field><field name="description">Master of Dental Surgery</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hypnosis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Micromechanical And Structural Analysis Of Compromised Dental Tissues</field><field name="creator">Mahoney, Erin Kathleen</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dental tissues</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymptotics of higher-order Painlev&#233; equations</field><field name="creator">Morrison, Tegan Ann</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Painleve&#769; equations</field><field name="subject">Asymptotic analysis</field><field name="subject">ODE theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conversing across the ages : a conversation around some intellectual and social paradigms of Graeco-Roman antiquity, the apostle Paul, and modern evangelicalism</field><field name="creator">Strom, Mark</field><field name="description">In Part One, I first argue that the life and thought of educated Graeco-Romans was profoundly shaped by a tension between characteristions of a primary reality and the social experiences of everyday reality. The tension surfaced in various models, images, and expectations of the real-the-essence-the-ideal-the-perfect which both reflected and reinforced the presumption of a higher reality lying somewhere other than in the stuff of everyday life. The second chapter sketches the broad contours of Paul's preoccupation with Jesus Christ. I note how his focus on Christ spilled over into a penchant for the historical, the personal, and the social. I explore these as three interdependent axes of his thought. In chapter three I use the vantage point constructed in the first two chapters to see the distinctiveness of Paul's thought and experience over against the patterns of Graeco-Roman philosophy, theology, religion, and morality. Part Two, explores the ways in which Paul's knowledge of Christ offered coherence within the contingencies of everyday experience. Chapter four focuses on Paul's conversations for change. The topic of these chapters are really inseparable not only from each other, but from those of the previous chapters on Paul's life and thought. Thus certain themes recur through chapters two to five so that the four chapters form a continuous presentation of Paul's life and thought, albeit from several different perspectives. Part Three carries the conversation forward to evangelicalism. In chapter six, I view the sermon as a critical event in the life of evangelicalism, and as the bridge between the academy and the congregation. I concentrate on the intellectual and social phenomena which highlight an evangelical's experience of the movement as a system and a culture. This leads me to consider how evangelical meanings have broken down in the experience of some evangelicals. In chapter seven, I look at ways in which the system and culture and evangelicalism shape the reading of Paul. My focus here is on the drive to attach the epithets 'biblical' and 'unbiblical' to people, propositions, and behaviours. I argue that the intellectual and social phenomena suggest that being 'biblical' or otherwise has as much to do with social acceptability as it does with proximity to the biblical texts. This brings me full circle to the analogies which evangelicalism holds both Paul and to his Graeco-Roman milieu.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Graeco-Roman</field><field name="subject">biblical</field><field name="subject">evangelicalism</field><field name="subject">Jesus Christ</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/14</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Triage education : from experience to practice standards</field><field name="creator">McNally, Stephen</field><field name="description">This thesis has several aims.

Research in this thesis employs a new International Monetary Fund&#8217;s (IMF&#8217;s) Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) dataset to examine bilateral equity investment in the international and Australian context. This dataset is being employed for the first time in the Australian context. Research in this thesis provides insights into the broad trends on cross country holdings and indicates that the growth in goods trade and stock market capitalisation are the main determinants of the growth in the scale of international balance sheets. This thesis develops a model that links bilateral equity holdings to bilateral trade in goods and services. This thesis finds that the bilateral equity investment is strongly correlated with the underlying patterns of trade in goods and services. Research in this thesis states that the bilateral equity investments take place between countries with similar characteristics, including coordinated business cycles and correlated stock market returns, against the predictions of standard diversification Research in this thesis provides answers to some of the following questions; why does the pattern of Australia&#8217;s capital flows not match that of its trade flows; which bilateral factors are responsible for explaining Australia&#8217;s portfolio equity investment holdings; are cultural, informational factors important in explaining Australia&#8217;s portfolio allocations; How do regulatory and legal variables affect equity portfolio holdings. Research in this thesis investigates geographical bias by developing an empirical model from a consumption based asset pricing model that includes both, information and transaction costs. Research in this thesis documents that investors exhibit a preference for geographically close, same language and same culture countries. This thesis states that Australian investors&#8217; are willing to hold equity portfolios in countries where the judicial system is recognised as efficient and appears to uphold enforcement of the rule of law, and countries which have well developed accounting standards. Research in this thesis also investigate home bias puzzle in the international and Australian context. This thesis indicates that the share of destination countries&#8217; stock market that is invested in the host country, capital controls, trade links, risk adjusted returns and transaction costs have impact on the home bias puzzle.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international business enterprises</field><field name="subject">equity investment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinetics and mechanisms of methoxide substitution and electroreduction of hexachlorobenzene</field><field name="creator">Sidhu, Jeswant K.</field><field name="description">Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) is a pollutant, and there is an urgent need to degrade it. Two methods of degrading HCB to ethers are nucleophilic substitution and electroreduction, chosen for their viability and safety. The kinetics of substitution of HCB by potassium hydroxide and methanol were examined. The substitution of HCB by methoxide produced 1,2,3,5-tetrachloro-4.6-dimethoxybenzene (1,2,3,5-TCDMB) as the major substitution product, and side reactions produced extra chloride due to other substitution products. Thus, the proposed reaction mechanism is complicated due to the formation of ethers and phenols due to consecutive and parallel reactions. The substitution products of HCB were uncatalytically and catalytically electroreduced. Products with increasingly more methoxy substituents had lower electron affinities and increasing positive free energies. Catalysed electroreduction was more effective than uncatalysed electroreduction in dechlorinating the HCB substitution products to aromatic ethers. The most effective organic catalysts were those that possessed the lowest electron affinity as reflected in the reduction potential. A combination of nucleophilic substitution and electroreduction of HCB and its substitution products produced mono-, di- and trimethoxide chloroaromatic ethers and phenols.

Secondly, the study assessed the prevalence of health-enhancing behaviours at the time of the first AMI and 6 months after this event.Thirdly, the magnitude of health behavioural change was then examined. Fourthly, sociodemographic, clinical and psychosocial predictors of health-enhancing behaviours were explored.These health-enhancing behaviours included non-smoking behaviours, normal body mass index (BMI), adequate physical activity, medication adherence and low dietary fat intake. Finally, the study examined relationships between sociodemographic , psychosocial and modifiable lifestyle factors, based on Antonovsky's hypothesis on sense of coherence(SOC), stress and adaptive coping. The study highlights that some modifiable risk factors, for example, being overweight or obese and physical inactivity were more resistant to change following an AMI.This finding, and the relationship between stress and increased dietary fat suggest a need for individualised programs to support the specific needs of AMI patients to change their modifiable cardiac risk factors.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acute myocardial infarction</field><field name="subject">heart attack</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">healthy lifestyles</field><field name="subject">risk factors</field><field name="subject">heart disease</field><field name="subject">changing lifestyle</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/267</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuron-adaptive neural network models and applications</field><field name="creator">Xu, Shuxiang</field><field name="description">Artificial Neural Networks have been widely probed by worldwide researchers to cope with the problems such as function approximation and data simulation. This thesis deals with Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNN's) with a new neuron activation function called Neuron-adaptive Activation Function (NAF), and Feed-forward Higher Order Neural Networks (HONN's) with this new neuron activation function. We have designed a new neural network model, the Neuron-Adaptive Neural Network (NANN), and mathematically proved that one NANN can approximate any piecewise continuous function to any desired accuracy. In the neural network literature only Zhang proved the universal approximation ability of FNN Group to any piecewise continuous function. Next, we have developed the approximation properties of Neuron Adaptive Higher Order Neural Networks (NAHONN's), a combination of HONN's and NAF, to any continuous function, functional and operator. Finally, we have created a software program called MASFinance which runs on the Solaris system for the approximation of continuous or discontinuous functions, and for the simulation of any continuous or discontinuous data (especially financial data). Our work distinguishes itself from previous work in the following ways: we use a new neuron-adaptive activation function, while the neuron activation functions in most existing work are all fixed and can't be tuned to adapt to different approximation problems; we only use on NANN to approximate any piecewise continuous function, while a neural network group must be utilised in previous research; we combine HONN's with NAF and investigate its approximation properties to any continuous function, functional, and operator; we present a new software program, MASFinance, for function approximation and data simulation. Experiments running MASFinance indicate that the proposed NANN's present several advantages over traditional neuron-fixed networks (such as greatly reduced network size, faster learning, and lessened simulation errors), and that the suggested NANN's can effectively approximate piecewise continuous functions better than neural networks groups. Experiments also indicate that NANN's are especially suitable for data simulation</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neural networks</field><field name="subject">MASFinance</field><field name="subject">network size</field><field name="subject">faster learning</field><field name="subject">simulation errors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular recognition of DNA by metal co-ordination complexes</field><field name="creator">Greguric, Ivan</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the design, synthesis, optical resolution of polypyridyl metal complexes and their molecular recognition of DNA. These metal complexes have been synthesised to bind DNA intercalation in a sequence selective manner. Modifications have manipulated the intercalative segments to bind to DNA in a rigid fashion by appending chemical groups directly to the aromatic extensions of the fragment. Also the ancillary non-intercalative ligands comprised of either bidentates or tetradentates, have been specifically chosen to deliver appended groups along the DNA sugar phosphate backbone, for hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. Classical and chromatographic separation methods were investigated to separate the optical isomers of these ruthenium (II) complexes. A liquid recycling chromatography system was most successfully employed. Stereoselective synthesis was also investigated. Ultimately, it has been shown that the systematic modification of simple metal complexes is a useful method in determining the interactions of simple metal for nucleic acids.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polypyridyl metal</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">synthesis</field><field name="subject">optical resolution</field><field name="subject">chromatography</field><field name="subject">nucleic acid</field><field name="subject">van der Waals interactions</field><field name="subject">optical isomers</field><field name="subject">ruthenium</field><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting realistic performance rate and optimum inspection rate in construction</field><field name="creator">Saha, Swapan</field><field name="description">This study has been concerned with investigating several aspects of error, including human error, and the underlying causes in construction.It has attempted to calculate the realistic error rate and as a result has identified the optimum inspection rate in construction.Error prediction in construction is a new field of study, particularly with regard to repetitive construction processes.Several methodologies and probalistic approaches have been considered.Case studies have been presented and the findings shown.

The focus of the perceptual reorganisation research to date has been on infants&#8217; discrimination of nonnative segments, in particular, consonants and vowels. In tone languages (eg. Cantonese, Mandarin, and Thai) phonemic distinctions are signalled not only by consonants and vowels, but also by lexical tone &#8211; consisting of variations in fundamental frequency (pitch) and related features. Although such languages are spoken by over half the world&#8217;s population, the development of lexical tone perception has been relatively neglected. This thesis addresses whether perceptual reorganisation occurs for tone in infancy. Overall, the results of experiments conducted support the hypotheses and the existence of perceptual reorganisation for tone in infancy, similar to that for consonants and vowels. Implications of the results for speech perception development theories, &#8220;tone space&#8221;, tone acquisition, and early word learning are discussed, and future studies relating to these issues suggested.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese language</field><field name="subject">phonetics</field><field name="subject">lexical phonology</field><field name="subject">tone</field><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/27010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationship between organogenesis differentiation and histolocalization of selected alkaloids in duboisia myoporoides R.

Histological analyses explained the relationship between cell arrangement in the cultured tissues and organs and the cytokinin/auxin combinations used at the callus induction stage. The cultured tissues and organs were analysed histochemically to localize alkaloids in different types of cells by using selected alkaloid colour reagents i.e., platinic chloride (5%) and iodoplatinate. The presence or absence of nicotine, hyoscyamine and scopolamine in the cultured tissues and organs was then confirmed by GC-MS analysis. This is the first work to show that tropane alkaloid formation in the separated cultured organs is related to xylem differentiation and tropane alkaloid formation in the calli cultured in suspension may allow commercial tropane alkaloid production without regenerating the organs. The roots of the D. myoporoides field-grown trees were colonized by the AM fungi and the mycorrhizal infection was ranged from 0-30% which indicates that the secondary metabolite atropine and scopolamine did not prevent AM fungal colonization.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alkaloid</field><field name="subject">xylem</field><field name="subject">tropane</field><field name="subject">duboisia myoporoides</field><field name="subject">organogenesis</field><field name="subject">calli</field><field name="subject">fungi</field><field name="subject">medicinal plant</field><field name="subject">mycorrhizal infection</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Techniques to handle missing values in a factor analysis</field><field name="creator">Turville, Christopher</field><field name="description">A factor analysis typically involves a large collection of data, and it is common for some of the data to be unrecorded. This study investigates the ability of several techniques to handle missing values in a factor analysis, including complete cases only, all available cases, imputing means, an iterative component method, singular value decomposition and the EM algorithm. A data set that is representative of that used for a factor analysis is simulated. Some of this data are then randomly removed to represent missing values, and the performance of the techniques are investigated over a wide range of conditions. Several criteria are used to investigate the abilities of the techniques to handle missing values in a factor analysis. Overall, there is no one technique that performs best for all of the conditions studied. The EM algorithm is generally the most effective technique except when there are ill-conditioned matrices present or when computing time is of concern. Some theoretical concerns are introduced regarding the effects that changes in the correlation matrix will have on the loadings of a factor analysis. A complicated expression is derived that shows that the change in factor loadings as a result of change in the elements of a correlation matrix involves components of eigenvectors and eigenvalues.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">data analysis</field><field name="subject">missing data</field><field name="subject">factor loadings</field><field name="subject">Monte Carlo methods</field><field name="subject">variances</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/395</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trigonometric polynomial high order neural network group models for financial data simulation and prediction</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Jing Chun</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates a new method for financial data simulation using novel neural network models developed by the author. Using two improved models for financial data simulation and prediction, the trigonometric polynomial higher order neural network group models have been developed. The theoretical principles of these improved models are presented and demonstrated in the thesis. It is the first attempt to use trigonometric polynomial high order neural network group models for financial data simulation. We could not find any references to using trigonometric polynomial high order neural network group models for financial data simulation in the extensive literature search conducted for this thesis, including a thorough Internet search on this topic. The author has developed a computer program, called 'THONG'. The program, running on X-windows, is based on the new neural network models developed, and also uses group models. This program allows users to apply in practice his new analysis and prediction method. The 'THONG' program is a user-friendly GUI system. All the steps of the operation in this system are easily controlled using a mouse. Both system operation and system mode can be viewed during the processing of data. THONG models have proven capable of handling high frequency, high order nonlinear and discontinuous data. The results of processing the experimental data using the THONG financial simulator are presented in the thesis. These results confirm that the THONG group models converge without difficulty, and are considerably more accurate than traditional neural network models.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neural networks</field><field name="subject">THONG</field><field name="subject">trigonometric</field><field name="subject">financial data</field><field name="subject">GU</field><field name="subject">discontinuous data</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whole plant response to soil compaction : from field practices to mechanisms</field><field name="creator">Montagu, Kelvin D.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the growth response and inter-relationships between shoots and roots of plants grown in compact soil. In the field, two topsoil and two subsoil conditions were created with five vegetable crops sequentially grown. Between 6 and 12% of the root system grew in the compact subsoil, which had a soil strength of 3.1 c.f. 1.9 MPa in the loosened subsoil. Both the root length density (Lv) and the specific root length were lower in the compact subsoil (80% and 30%, respectively). This had no effect on shoot growth when water and nutrients were well supplied. Compensatory root growth in the lose soil above the compact subsoil occurred in broccoli plants. As a result plants grown in soil with or without a compact subsoil had a similar total root length but with altered root distribution. When the water and nitrogen supplied to the soil was reduced, the lower subsoil Lv in the compact subsoil did not restrict water or N acquisition. This was possibly due to a large increase in the specific uptake per unit length of root, by the fewer roots in the compact subsoil. Compared to the subsoil treatments, only small changes in topsoil physical properties occurred when tillage was ceased. From the field trials the proportion and time of root growth into compact soil appeared important in determining the plant response. In a series of split-root experiments (horizontal and vertical arrangements of compact and loose soil) compensatory root growth in the loose soil only occurred when the root system was exposed to horizontally compact soil When compensatory root growth did not occur shoot growth was reduced. This resulted in there being a close relationship between total root length and leaf area. Further test results support a direct effect of mechanical impedance on shoot growth with a rapid (within 10 minutes) and large (50%) reduction in leaf elongation occurring when roots were mechanically impeded. In the field only plants whose roots were totally exposed to compact soil had reduced shoot growth with very compact subsoil having no effect.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">crops</field><field name="subject">plants</field><field name="subject">soil compaction</field><field name="subject">topsoil</field><field name="subject">subsoil</field><field name="subject">roots</field><field name="subject">shoots</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">tillage</field><field name="subject">broccoli</field><field name="subject">lettuce</field><field name="subject">root length</field><field name="subject">shoot growth</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biogeochemical characterization of metalliferous wastes and potential role of arbuscular mycorrhizae in their phytoremediation</field><field name="creator">Chaudhry, Tariq M.</field><field name="description">Phytoremediation is an innovative technology employing plants for reclamation of soils that have been polluted by industrial contaminants. While it is frequently slower than traditional physicochemical remediation techniques, there are, however, many significant advantages including simplicity, low cost, improvement of soil structure and microbiological fertility. While various hyperaccumulators have been reported from Europe and the USA, there is a need to identify Australian species. This study reports a number of metal accumulators following a soil and vegetation survey of two metal contaminated sites in New South Wales, the spoil (filtercake) heaps of the BHP (Broken Hill Propriety ) steelworks at Port Kembla and the abandoned mine at Sunny Corner. BHP is the largest manufacturer of steel in Australia. The Port Kembla is the largest single steel manufacturing site. Solid by-products from this site totalled 3.1 million tons in 1988. The Sunny Corner mine site was mainly a silver mine which operated over approximately 100 hectares 1184 to 1922 and produced over 100 tonnes of silver during that period. The soil and water in and around the site is heavily contaminated with metals and is distinctly acidic. It was concluded that Ricinus communis, Sonchus oleraceus, baeckea utilis, Poa labillardieri and Pinus radiata are options for heavy metal phytoremediation of contaminated Australian soils. Arbuscular Mycorrhizal infection (particular with Glomus and Gigaspora strains) should be promoted for optimum growth.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reclamation</field><field name="subject">contaminants</field><field name="subject">BHP</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">soil structure</field><field name="subject">accumulators</field><field name="subject">phytoremediation</field><field name="subject">steelworks</field><field name="subject">Port Kembla</field><field name="subject">Sunny Corner</field><field name="subject">acidic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A grounded theory of care management after traumatic brain injury</field><field name="creator">McCluskey, Annie</field><field name="description">This study explores the processes and conditions surrounding long-term care decision-making and care management after traumatic brain injury. Grounded theory methodology and methods were used. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a total of 51 participants in New South Wales, Australia. A grounded theory of care management was developed through constant comparison of data and cases and identified a social problem, a core social process, strategies, conditions and consequences. The basic social problem was the need for ongoing care, a problem which the person with brain injury and others managed collectively. Together, they determined an appropriate care location or living situation, configuration of carers and level of care. This study provides a framework for understanding preferred ways of living with care after brain injury. Increased autonomy was a desired outcome. Living alone and spending time alone were associated with increased autonomy and increased risk. A series of strategies and processes are suggested that allow professionals and family carers to gradually increase risk, and share responsibility for risk management.

Different concepts of need were explored, which required multiple methodologies including a review of government policies and legislation, analysis of demographic, injury related and service usage data obtained from a survey, and analysis of interviews with persons with spinal injuries and their carers. Normative need was interpreted by government and service providers in terms of functional impairment and economic disadvantage, which did not reflect the individual needs of persons with spinal injuries. Neither were services for persons with spinal injuries provided to individuals according to the criteria of their felt or expressed need for services, their perceptions of the intrinsic importance of services, nor on the basis of redressing comparative inequities in service distribution. Persons with spinal injuries&#8217; need for community services could only be understood on the basis of the contribution services made to the realisation of their plans of life, that is, to be ordinary. In order to parallel plans of ordinariness, services need to be offered in partnership with, or under the control of the person with spinal injuries, foster an essential relationship between the provider and the person with spinal injuries, and not inappropriately assess and judge the life plans of persons with spinal injuries based upon providers&#8217; perceptions of difference.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">services for people with spinal injuries</field><field name="subject">services for people with disabilities</field><field name="subject">community services</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/497</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computer anxiety : assessment and treatment</field><field name="creator">McInerney, Valentina</field><field name="description">This thesis represents the results of studies designed to investigate computer anxiety among adult learners. The existence, nature and degree of computer anxiety were investigated with a sample of teacher trainees undertaking an introductory computer training course, and the impact of this course on the anxiety and cognitions of the students were studied. Another study focussed on the evaluation of the measure of computer anxiety used in this study with a view to the design of a new computer anxiety treatment. Results showed that computer anxiety is not necessarily dissipated by completing a computer course, and is correlated with gender, computer ownership and previous computer experience. A number of faculties with different student populations were studied, and computer anxiety was high within each. Interviews with computing course coordinators indicated a range of approaches to instructional design, beliefs about the extent and causes of computer anxiety, and ways of alleviating it. Two approaches derived from these interviews formed the basis of the design of this study, with instructional methods as the treatments and levels of computer anxiety and negative cognitions as the aptitudes. The sample comprised two, with the first group receiving traditional instruction while the second group received direct instruction plus metacognitive strategy training in self-questioning within a cooperative learning context. Achievement was significantly enhanced in the second group, and it was felt that metacognitive training was effective as a means of enhancing achievement and positive cognitions.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational psychology</field><field name="subject">computer literacy</field><field name="subject">computer use</field><field name="subject">computer courses</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Worker exposure to dusts and bioaerosols in the sheep shearing industry in eastern NSW</field><field name="creator">Kift, Ryan L.</field><field name="description">The air found in a shearing shed environment is normally contaminated with many different airborne substances. These contaminants include dust (predominantly organic), bioaerosols (fungi and bacteria), and gases (ammonia and carbon monoxide). Respiratory disorders have been associated with exposure to the types of contaminants found in a normal sheep shearing environment. Twenty nine shearing sheds in the state of New South Wales in Eastern Australia were sampled for concentrations of airborne contaminants. Based on the results of this study the following recommendations are made for the shearing industry: under the current dust and bioaerosol exposure standards there are no requirements to investigate mechanical ventilation to reduce airborne contaminants and there is no need for respiratory protection in any of the monitored sheds. However, it is recommended that if a person has a known predisposition to respiratory illness/stress they should be closely monitored while working in a shearing shed. There are issues raised in this thesis that require further research including the need for an epidemiological study on the health of people working in shearing sheds in relation to their respiratory health. The monitoring of shearing sheds in other regions of Australia needs to be undertaken and based on available literature similar studies are also needed in other livestock industries in Australia.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep shearing</field><field name="subject">hazards</field><field name="subject">dust related diseases</field><field name="subject">aerosols</field><field name="subject">health aspects</field><field name="subject">shearers</field><field name="subject">shearing sheds</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/18702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning by experience: reconstructing the literacy engagement of nine men who self-report literacy difficulties</field><field name="creator">Kell, Marilyn Fay</field><field name="description">This thesis, a qualitative study, examined the literacy practices of nine workers who self-report literacy difficulties.

Through analysis of the workers&#8217; experiences this thesis explored sociocultural themes deriving from Vygotskian traditions such as the central mediational role of psychological tools and signs and the importance of activity taking place in social settings. It took the theoretical position that literacy is an increasingly complex construct that extends beyond functional connotations such as reading, writing and spelling. It focused on the kinds of literacy skills that individuals require in a world characterised by rapid and frequent changes. In doing so this thesis recognised the diverse modalities in literacy performance that emphasise ways of knowing and ways of doing or designing as well as reading, writing, listening, thinking, speaking and comprehending across a range of modalities. This thesis argues that sociocultural concepts are applicable to adult learners. In particular it concludes that adult learners in the course of their jobs demonstrate a repertoire of literacy competence through engagement in meaningful literacy practices.

Quizalofp-p-tefuryl is a relatively new herbicide with apparent low toxicity and is readily degraded. Its metabolite also has herbicide activity. Quizalofop-p-tefuryl is a aryloxyphenoxypropionate and is a post emergence herbicide used for pulses and vegetables. This work reports on a method for the analyses of this pesticide residue and its metabolite in soybean using HPLC on a C-18 column with UV detection at 332 nm. Several methods are tried including some involving the use of solid phase extractors like silica, Florisil and strong cationic exchange cartridges. The main method developed uses an extraction solvent hexane: acetone: acetic acid for extracting the quizalofop-p-tefuryl and quizalofop from the ground soybean. The extracts are then made alkaline with NaOH and this deprotonates the quizalofop separating it from the hexane phase which contains the quizalofop-p-tefuryl. The hexane phase is extracted with ACN and quizalofop-p-tefuryl partitions into this phase. The quizalof-p-tefuryl is repartitioned into a fresh diethyl ether: hexane phase by adding a large quantity of H2O and NaCL to the ACN layer. The organic phase is washed and evaporated to dryness before being made up to volume with ACN for direct analysis by UV detection or by derivatising it to methoxychloroquinoxaline for fluorescence detection. Using the method that directly detects the analytes, for quizalofop-p-tefuryl and quizalofop at spike levels, the method has average recoveries. The precision of recoveries for both compounds is about 9%. The method is fairly robust. Time of analysis per analyte is about 2 hrs.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">UV detection</field><field name="subject">herbicide</field><field name="subject">quizalofop</field><field name="subject">hexane</field><field name="subject">diethyl</field><field name="subject">pulses</field><field name="subject">vegetables</field><field name="subject">pesticide</field><field name="subject">toxicity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of water quality modelling in decision-making</field><field name="creator">McNamara, Leslie</field><field name="description">Catchment management organisations often use computer-based water quality models to support their decision-making needs. However, literature suggests that model use by catchment managers can be highly problematical. Commonly reported issues that negatively impact upon the effectiveness of modelling for decision-making are data quality and availability, miscommunication between analysts and decision-makers, inappropriate treatment of uncertainty, excessive model complexity (&#8216;sophistication&#8217;) or simplicity and poor modelling practice. The challenges that beset catchment managers are usually framed as technical problems that can be overcome by using or communicating the science that underlies the models more effectively. As a result, many of the problems associated with the use of models by catchment managers have not been adequately elucidated from the standpoint of a manager. This thesis examines the problem of modelling for decision-making from a fresh perspective. Systemic approaches to research are commonly used where the research problem is ill-defined, as it is here. &#8216;Action research&#8217; is one qualitative, systemic methodology, and was used here as the guiding methodology to explore the model related problems faced by catchment managers. Action research involves recurrent cycles of planning, action, observation and reflection. The research was undertaken with the Sydney Catchment Authority (SCA), a New South Wales government agency responsible for water quality and catchment health in the drinking water catchments of Sydney, Australia. The SCA had expressed a particular need for tools to support the assessment of development applications with respect to potential impacts on water quality, and to prioritise rural land for remedial action to improve water quality in the drinking water catchments. The research had two broad aims that were:1.to develop two models differing in sophistication, and to use them to prioritise nutrient pollution sources and calculate nutrient loads; And, through the participatory development of the models, 2.to learn methodological lessons that catchment managers can apply to choose and use models more effectively. In this research, action was in the form of five planned activities, including: i. a review of relevant literature from diverse disciplines; ii. the holding of two workshops; the first exclusively involving SCA managers to identify their modelling needs, and the second involving water quality scientists and modelers to discuss methods for meeting the modelling needs; iii. the development and use of two export coefficient nutrient models; iv. a focus group discussion involving key staff in the SCA; and v. a review of published guidelines for good modelling practice in environmental management. Note was also taken of statements or behaviour at numerous meetings and seminars, mostly with SCA staff, that were relevant to the research questions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">water quality management</field><field name="subject">drinking water</field><field name="subject">catchment management</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/18899</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of the Cottage Community Care Pilot Project</field><field name="creator">Kelleher, Killarney</field><field name="description">The outcomes of a child protection/family support programme, the Cottage Community Care Pilot Project, were evaluated in this study. The evaluation employed a non-equivalent comparison group design of 'at risk' consenting first-time mothers in the perinatal period with babies up to 6 weeks of age. Ninety-three families were recruited and 58 of these were matched with a trained volunteer home visitor. Analysis of assessment items and questionnaires, reviews of hospital records and the Department of Community Services Child abuse and neglect notification register and focus groups with mothers and volunteers provided the information used in this study. The CCCP had an impact on particular aspects of family function, certain infant and maternal health indices and the families' use of community services, but its contribution to reducing the incidence of child abuse and neglect is less clear. Client and volunteer feedback indicated support for the programme. While home visitation by trained volunteers is not proposed as the total answer for effective child protection or family support, the findings of this evaluation suggest that there is a place for similar programmes.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">home-based family services</field><field name="subject">child abuse</field><field name="subject">infant welfare</field><field name="subject">community health services</field><field name="subject">family support</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing demand for organic lamb using choice modelling</field><field name="creator">Rutledge, M. P.</field><field name="description">The worldwide market for organic foods is growing fast, but New Zealand meat producers have been slow to respond. Specifically, New Zealand producers have little or no organic lamb products for export or domestic sale. Part of the reason for this hesitancy to meet demand with supply is that the nature of the demand and consumer willingness to pay for the product is not well understood. The purpose of this study is to investigate New Zealand organic food consumers&#8217; attitudes towards organic food and production methods and to evaluate consumer willingness to pay for an organic lamb product. Data for this study was collected using computer aided personal interviewing (CAPI) in supermarkets and speciality stores in Christchurch and Wellington. The study questioned consumers about their consumption habits, attitudes towards organic food and production methods and presented choice modelling scenarios to test willingness to pay for different attributes of lamb. Factor analysis is used to group the 12 attitudinal questions into three factors which were then placed into a two step cluster analysis to create consumer segments. Choice modelling was then used to measure consumer preferences for the tested attributes of lamb. From the factor and cluster analysis three distinct consumer segments were found and labelled as Committed Organic Seekers, Convenience Organic Consumers and Incidental Organic Consumers. These labels reflect each group&#8217;s organic consumption habits and attitudes towards organic food. The choice modelling results show that there is a willingness to pay for organic lamb. The three identified consumer groups state they would pay a premium of 61%, 44% and 26% respectively for organic lamb over standard pasture raised lamb. This paper gives an insight into consumer attitudes and preferences towards a product that could provide a way for New Zealand farmers to increase their returns. It contributes to the body of knowledge about the likely consumer profiles of regular consumers of organic food. There are only a few other studies that have attempted to measure consumer attitudes and willingness to pay for organic meat, however, the author is not aware of any published example of a study that has specifically investigated demand for organic lamb anywhere in the world. The study provides information about stated willingness to pay for five different attributes of lamb; this information should be of value in assisting the industry by showing which product offerings are likely to generate the highest sale price.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organic</field><field name="subject">lamb</field><field name="subject">choice modelling</field><field name="subject">factor analysis</field><field name="subject">cluster analysis</field><field name="subject">consumer attitudes</field><field name="subject">willingness to pay</field><field name="subject">organic food</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A sedimentological and geochemical approach to understanding cycles of stratovolcano growth and collapse at Mt Taranaki, New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Earth Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zernack, Anke Verena</field><field name="description">The long-term behaviour of andesitic stratovolcanoes is characterised by a repetition of edifice growth and collapse phases. This cyclic pattern may represent a natural frequency at varying timescales in the growth dynamics of stratovolcanoes, but is often difficult to identify because of long cycle-timescales, coupled with incomplete stratigraphic records. The volcaniclastic ring-plain succession surrounding the 2 518 m Mt. Taranaki, New Zealand, comprises a wide variety of distinctive volcanic mass-flow lithofacies with sedimentary and lithology characteristics that can be related to recurring volcanic cycles over &gt;190 ka. Debrisflow and monolithologic hyperconcentrated-flow deposits record edifice growth phases while polylithologic debris-avalanche and associated cohesive debris-flow units were emplaced by collapse. Major edifice failures at Mt. Taranaki occurred on-average every 10 ka, with five events recognised over the last 30 ka, a time interval for which stratigraphic records are more complete. The unstable nature of Mt. Taranaki mainly results from its weak internal composite structure including abundant saturated pyroclastic deposits and breccia layers, along with its growth on a weakly indurated and tectonically fractured basement of Tertiary mudstones and sandstones. As the edifice repeatedly grew beyond a critical stable height or profile, large-scale collapses were triggered by intrusions preceding magmatic activity, major eruptions, or significant regional tectonic fault movements. Clasts within debris-avalanche deposits were used as a series of windows into the composition of previous successive proto-Mt Taranaki edifices in order to examine magmatic controls on their failure. The diversity of lithologies and their geochemical characteristics are similar throughout the history of the volcano, with the oldest sample suites displaying a slightly broader range of compositions including more primitive rock types. The evolution to a narrower range and higher-silica compositions was accompanied by an increase in K2O. This shows that later melts progressively interacted with underplated amphibolitic material at the base of the crust. These gradual changes imply a long-term stability of the magmatic system. The preservation of similar internal conditions during the volcano&#8217;s evolution, hence suggests that external processes were the main driving force behind its cyclic growth and collapse behaviour and resulting sedimentation pattern.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vulcanology</field><field name="subject">Mount Taranaki</field><field name="subject">Mount Egmont</field><field name="subject">volcanoes</field><field name="subject">stratigraphic geology</field><field name="subject">geochemistry</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260103 Vulcanology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capturing event metadata in the sky : a Java-based application for receiving astronomical internet feeds : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Computer Science in Computer Science at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Feng</field><field name="description">When an astronomical observer discovers a transient event in the sky, how can the information be immediately shared and delivered to others? Not too long time ago, people shared the information about what they discovered in the sky by books, telegraphs, and telephones. The new generation of transferring the event data is the way by the Internet. The information of astronomical events is able to be packed and put online as an Internet feed. For receiving these packed data, an Internet feed listener software would be required in a terminal computer. In other applications, the listener would connect to an intelligent robotic telescope network and automatically drive a telescope to capture the instant Astrophysical phenomena. However, because the technologies of transferring the astronomical event data are in the initial steps, the only resource available is the Perl-based Internet feed listener developed by the team of eSTAR. In this research, a Java-based Internet feed listener was developed. The application supports more features than the Perl-based application. After applying the rich Java benefits, the application is able to receive, parse and manage the Internet feed data in an efficient way with the friendly user interface.

In order to provide a descriptive account of the holistic aspects of introducing Maori musical concepts in a music therapy setting a qualitative design was employed. The study draws on my personal journal entries, an interview with Kaumatua (Maori respected elders) regarding the appropriateness of introducing and altering traditional Maori musicality to accommodate the patient&#8217;s needs and a case study involving the Haka as a music therapy intervention strategy with a young Maori patient diagnosed with schizophrenia. My findings show that as a music therapist consultation with Kaumatua regarding anything related to Maori cultural aspects was essential. I also found that when working with a Maori Rangatahi who is immersed in Maori culture, it created an atmosphere of containment, familiarity, enjoyment, engagement and an environment that facilitated the achievement of therapeutic goals. Te Whare Tapa Wha Maori mental health model is well suited as a music therapy assessment tool to the characteristics of the physical, emotional, spiritual and family context of the Haka. I also found that Tauiwi music therapists wishing to introduce cultural elements must first learn about Maori culture and the people in order to confidently understand the music. Tauiwi Rangatahi may also benefit from the introduction of Maori musicality as a therapeutic means by being an inclusive member of the community and the positive psychological effects. For example, Rangatahi benefited from learning the proper pronunciation and meaning of the Haka, which in turn gave them a sense of achievement. I also found that some Maori protocols fit well with the protocols of music therapy, such as the beginning and endings with a hello and goodbye song.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori music</field><field name="subject">Tauiwi Rangatahi</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">Maori culture</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/898</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agricultural export growth and economic development for Tonga : the quest for efficiency : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Public Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kautoke-Holani, Alisi Wenonalita</field><field name="description">Neo-liberalism has become the dominant approach to economic development since the 1980s. Based on the economic principle of &#8220;efficiency&#8221;, the Washington Consensus and its supporters have avidly promoted the neoliberal orthodoxy as the ideal blueprint for the economic development of all countries in every region. However, as this thesis has discovered, the efficiency of public policy is weighed not by its conformity to an ideology but on how effective it responds to the economic and social problems of the population in question. In recent years Tonga has endured severe economic shocks which have pushed its low growth economy to the brink of economic crisis. In response to this crisis, the Government has chosen greater economic liberalisation and private sector &#8211; led growth to lead the economy to recovery. The Washington Consensus and its international supporters claim that this is the best policy response for Tonga due to the belief that greater liberalisation leads to greater efficiency. This thesis however believes that at the current dire state of the economy, it is not enough for Tongan public policy to just conform to international views on efficient economic development but to ensure that its economic development policies address the economic and social needs of the general Tongan population. With this in mind, this thesis investigated the role of agriculture in economic development. It identified that for an agriculture-based country such as Tonga, at low levels of growth, agricultural development is fundamental to long term economic growth. This research also revealed that agricultural growth is maximised through trade hence suggesting increased focus on agricultural export development. Based on these findings, this research project set out to verify the efficiency of Government agricultural policies by identifying the views of agricultural exporters and comparing these with Government approaches to agricultural export development in Tonga.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agricultural development</field><field name="subject">agricultural export</field><field name="subject">economic policy</field><field name="subject">Tongan public policy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340213 Economic development and growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/899</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A genealogy of subjective rights</field><field name="creator">Buonamano, Roberto, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation is an historical and philosophical study on the development of a subjective concept of individual rights. It takes the form of a history of ideas informed by genealogical methods of inquiry. Rather than seeking an origin for and underlying truth to human rights, it treats human rights as a product of various historical developments which are capable of being investigated in terms of their contingency as well as their continuous traditions. The thesis begins with an analysis of political theory in ancient Greek thought, primarily as a means of suggesting possible alternative political philosophies to the rights-based approach dominant in modern Western societies. The thesis then considers the theologicalpolitical discourse on sovereignty in the early Middle Ages, revolving around the doctrine of divine right and influenced by the function of the Christian Church in defining the nature of government. This is followed by an examination of the emergence of hierarchical, feudal relations and the formulation of feudal rights as based on proprietary notions and coinciding with individual liberties. In the following chapter there is a discussion of the juridical construction of sovereign power that emerged from the reception of Roman law and the development of canon law, the influence of legal textuality on the granting of rights and liberties, and the emergence of a discourse on public right as a way of defining the relationship between the prince and his subjects and thus delimiting sovereign authority. Finally, the thesis considers the legacy of the theory of natural rights and its relationship to forms of liberty, with an analysis of: firstly, the idea of natural rights that developed through canon law and the discussions surrounding the Franciscan poverty disputes; secondly, the role of property rights in the formulation of the rights of liberty; thirdly, the Christian understanding of liberty as a subjective attribute or power through the theo-ontological theory of human nature as represented by the free will; and fourthly, the transformation in Renaissance and early modern legal and political theory of the concept of liberty into a political doctrine about individual autonomy and inherent freedom. The purpose of the dissertation is to describe the multiple and complex historical processes from which the idea of subjective rights has emerged, as a means of understanding how human rights have come to play a seemingly essential role in modern legal and political discourses and practices.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human rights -- History</field><field name="subject">Civil rights -- History</field><field name="subject">Sovereignty -- History</field><field name="subject">Church and state -- History</field><field name="subject">Law, Medieval</field><field name="subject">Public law -- Europe -- History</field><field name="subject">Natural law -- History</field><field name="subject">Liberty -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31948</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional dissection of insulin-regulated GLUT4 vesicle tethering and docking.</field><field name="creator">Lopez, Jamie Antonio, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The insulin-dependent uptake of glucose by adipose and muscle tissues is accomplished through the regulated vesicle trafficking of the GLUT4 glucose transporter to the plasma membrane. The distal trafficking events comprising the tethering, docking and fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane are poorly defined, but represent vital steps in this pathway. This dissertation encompasses a series of complementary studies that have provided new insights into how these events are regulated in the adipocyte.  The Sec1p homologue Munc18c, is believed to play a central role in the docking of GLUT4 vesicles by controlling SNARE complex assembly. Munc18c was shown to bind the t-SNARE Syntaxin4 and form a stable complex in vivo. Protein binding studies demonstrated that Munc18c interacts with Syntaxin4 via an evolutionarily conserved N-terminal binding mode and the formation of the Munc18c/Syntaxin4 hetero-dimer was shown to promote SNARE complex assembly. In contrast to previous reports, I propose that Munc18c is positive regulator of SNARE assembly and vesicle docking.  The exocyst complex is thought to promote the tethering of exocytic GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane. Yeast two-hybrid screens revealed interactions between the exocyst subunits Sec6 and Exo70 and the SNARE-associated proteins Munc18c and Snapin, respectively. Snapin was subsequently shown to have a novel role in GLUT4 trafficking. These interactions suggest Munc18c and Snapin provide a course for cross-talk between the exocyst complex and the SNAREs to stimulate GLUT4 vesicle tethering and docking.  In addition to its interactions with Munc18c and Snapin, the exocyst was also found to interact with the GTP-bound form of RalA, a small GTPase regulated by insulin. RalA was almost exclusively localised to the plasma membrane of the adipocyte and a novel role for the RalA/exocyst interaction in GLUT4 trafficking was demonstrated. Specifically, overexpression of a GTP-deficient RalA mutant significantly inhibited  insulin-stimulated GLUT4 appearance on the plasma membrane. In addition to its role in GLUT4 trafficking, a novel role for RalA was demonstrated in insulin release from pancreatic -cells, indicating that RalA may represent a universal component of regulated exocytosis.  It is becoming increasingly apparent that vesicle trafficking events from yeast to mammals rely on similar protein complexes which communicate through multiple protein interactions, ensuring vesicle transport is highly coupled. Similarly, the Munc18c studies demonstrate that while mammalian cells have evolved to fulfil specialised functions throughout the body, some proteins appear to have retained the biochemical properties of their ancestors, emphasing the importance of this family of proteins throughout eukaryotic vesicle transport. In contrast, proteins such as RalA have evolved only in higher eukaryotes and appear to play a universal role in vesicle transport despite vast differences in the specialised functioning of mammalian cells.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Glucose -- Metabolism.</field><field name="subject">Insulin -- Physiological transport.</field><field name="subject">Cell membranes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40586</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Machine learning for automatic classification of remotely sensed data</field><field name="creator">Milne, Linda, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">As more and more remotely sensed data becomes available it is becoming increasingly harder to analyse it with the more traditional labour intensive, manual methods. The commonly used techniques, that involve expert evaluation, are widely acknowledged as providing inconsistent results, at best. We need more general techniques that can adapt to a given situation and that incorporate the strengths of the traditional methods, human operators and new technologies. The difficulty in interpreting remotely sensed data is that often only a small amount of data is available for classification. It can be noisy, incomplete or contain irrelevant information. Given that the training data may be limited we demonstrate a variety of techniques for highlighting information in the available data and how to select the most relevant information for a given classification task. We show that more consistent results between the training data and an entire image can be obtained, and how misclassification errors can be reduced. Specifically, a new technique for attribute selection in neural networks is demonstrated. Machine learning techniques, in particular, provide us with a means of automating classification using training data from a variety of data sources, including remotely sensed data and expert knowledge. A classification framework is presented in this thesis that can be used with any classifier and any available data. While this was developed in the context of vegetation mapping from remotely sensed data using machine learning classifiers, it is a general technique that can be applied to any domain. The emphasis of the applicability for this framework being domains that have inadequate training data available.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">contribution analysis</field><field name="subject">ensemble classifiers</field><field name="subject">multi-strategy classification</field><field name="subject">attribute selection</field><field name="subject">feature selection</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modalities, conditionals and nonmonotonic reasoning</field><field name="creator">Jauregui, Victor, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation conducts an investigation into nonmonotonic reasoning---forms of reasoning which allow defeasible inferences arrived at in the absence of  complete information, and which, when additional information is acquired, may need to be revoked. In contrast to the mathematical notion of consequence which is based on proof---mathematical proofs, once established, are beyond reproach, no matter what  additional information is acquired---nonmonotonic forms of reasoning are often employed in Artificial Intelligence, where generally only incomplete information is available, and often 'working' inferences need to be made; e.g. default inferences.  The platform on which this analysis of nonmonotonic reasoning is carried out is conditional logic; a relative of modal logic. This thesis explores notions of consequence formulated in conditional logic, and explores its possible-worlds semantics, and its connection to nonmonotonic consequence relations.  In particular, the notion of default consequence is explored, receiving the interpretation that something is inferred to be true by default if it holds in a `majority' of possible worlds. A number of accounts of majority-based reasoning appear in the literature. However, it is argued that some of the more well known accounts have counter-intuitive properties. An alternative definition of `majorities' is furnished, and both modal and conditional formulations of this form of inference are given and compared---favourably---with similar approaches in the literature.  A second, traditional problem of reasoning in Artificial Intelligence is tackled in  this thesis: reasoning about action. The treatment presented is again based on conditional logic, but also incorporates an account of dynamic logic. The semantics proposed approaches the frame problem from a different perspective; the familiar `minimal change' approach is generalised to an account based on the principle known as Occam's Razor.  The conditional introduced proves to be a valuable contribution to the account given---which again is compared, and contrasted with other approaches in the literature---accommodating a causal approach to the problem of correctly determining the indirect effects of an action.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Artificial Intelligence</field><field name="subject">Logic</field><field name="subject">Nonmonotonic reasoning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brightness Under Our Shoes: the Redress of the Poetic Imagination in the Poetry and Prose of David Malouf, 1960-1982.</field><field name="creator">Smith, Yvonne Joy</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">David Malouf - poetry, prose, novels, manuscripts, letters</field><field name="subject">poetic imagination - Wallace Stevens, Rainer Maria Rilke,Seamus Heaney</field><field name="subject">Judith Wright</field><field name="subject">Judith Rodriguez correspondence</field><field name="subject">experiential learning  David Kolb</field><field name="subject">Amercan "deep image" poetry</field><field name="subject">cognitive science and literature</field><field name="subject">neuroscience and literature</field><field name="subject">perception and literature</field><field name="subject">Australian literature</field><field name="subject">intelligence - theories</field><field name="subject">Johnno</field><field name="subject">An Imaginary Life</field><field name="subject">Child's Play</field><field name="subject">Fly Away Peter</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cobalt mineralisation in selected Australian deposits</field><field name="creator">Munro-Smith, Vera</field><field name="description">Investigations have been carried out for a number of cobalt deposits in Australia including three from the Mt Isa Block in Queensland, several deposits in New South Wales, and one deposit each in the Northern Territory and South Australia, with respect to the identification of cobalt-bearing mineralisation and possible modes of formation. The deposits studied cover a range of deposit and mineralisation types including hydrothermal (e.g., cobaltite, Esperanza, Queensland; arsenopyrite, Dome Rock, South Australia) and sedimentary (secondary mineralisation such as the manganese wads at Bungonia, New South Wales). Deposits that were studied previously by the author (MSc thesis) in the Mt Isa Block have been used for comparison of mineralisation and temperatures of formation. The determination of the temperatures of formation of mineralisation, in particular with respect to cobaltite and arsenopyrite, by means of the application of the FeAsSCoAsS-NiAsS ternary phase diagram and the arsenopyrite geothermometer, has helped lead to deductions concerning the modes of deposition. Other deposit features such as structural constraints and associated mineralisation aided in the formalisation of conclusions. Many of the deposits are hydrothermal in nature and contain high temperature phases including molybdenite and uraninite. The latter represent geochemical and mineralogical clues which show that many of the ores were emplaced by igneous processes associated with granites. The findings of this study suggest that despite high percentages of substituting species in arsenopyrite, derived temperatures, from the application of the binary and ternary geothermometers, are comparable. It was noted that the presence of pyrrhotite and/or l&#246;llingite to act as buffers in the system is an important constraint on the comparability of derived temperatures. Potential processing applications for the extraction of cobalt from ores are briefly discussed, with respect to the type and cobalt content of mineralisation identified. The Esperanza and the Selwyn copper-gold deposits show the greatest potential for economic cobalt recovery.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cobalt</field><field name="subject">cobalt ores</field><field name="subject">cobalt mines and mining</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/12917</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbial biopolymers from whey : production and applications</field><field name="creator">Dlamini, Abednego Mfanufikile</field><field name="description">The main aim of this research was to utilise whey as a fermentation substrate for the production of microbial biopolymers.Of the three commercial biopolymer producers tested for biopolymer production in whey, only Pseudodomonas elodea produced significant apparent viscosities of up to 470cP at 2 s-1 on enriched whey broths. In these broths lactose utilisation was poor (14% w/v). A strain of P. elodea that had improved lactose utilising capacity was selected after six serial transfers on whey and lactose rich broths. After screening more than 60 bacterial isolates, a strain of Klebsiella oxytoca that initially produced a broth apparent viscosity of 36 cP at 12 s-1 in whey was isolated from raw milk. Biopolymer production was optimised in the K. oxytoca isolate.Concentrations of over 16 g/1 and broth apparent viscosities greater than 20,000 cP at 0.6 s-1 were obtained after optimisation. The biopolymer produced by the K. oxytoca isolate was shown to contain rhamnose, glucose and cellobiose, a composition not comparable to any reported polysaccharide.

Woolly aphid populations were monitored over the 1995/96 and 1996/97 growing seasons, completing a four year study of the pest's status and management under IPM programs at Bathurst in the Central Tablelands of NSW. Woolly aphid infestation in 2 IPM treatments, based on alternative control techniques for codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.), namely mating disruption and fenoxycarb, were compared with a conventional insecticide azinphos-methyl program. Further, the thesis studied the toxicity, to adult European earwigs, of chemicals commonly used in Australian apple orchards. The pesticide alpha-cypermethrin is highly toxic to weevil spp. and is used by apple growers in Western Australia for their control, but it is also toxic to earwigs. This trial investigated the potential of alpha-cypermethrin to disrupt the biological control of woolly aphid. Following a single application as a butt spray, alpha-cypermethrin suppressed the number of earwigs in apple trees for 14 weeks. The single application did not reduce earwig numbers to the extent that the biological control of woolly aphid was lost, however a full season program with applications every 14 to 21 days to all trees, as recommended to control weevils, within an orchard is likely to be very disruptive. The research also studied the control of woolly aphid using insecticide root-soil drenches. Imidacloprid provided excellent control of woolly aphid for 3 seasons. Pirimcarb provided some suppression of woolly aphid during the first season, but not in subsequent seasons. Chlorpyrifos and vamidothion failed to control woolly aphid in any season.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">apple</field><field name="subject">orchard</field><field name="subject">woolly aphid</field><field name="subject">pests</field><field name="subject">earwigs</field><field name="subject">toxicity</field><field name="subject">pesticides</field><field name="subject">fruit</field><field name="subject">chemical</field><field name="subject">biological</field><field name="subject">infestation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Project finance risk pricing decision : Australian evidence</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Huyen T.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents empirical research into the project risk pricing decision undertaken by Australian project leaders for domestic project finance. It addresses questions about the relative importance of various project finance risks on the project risk pricing decision; the impact of risk interactions; and the degree of self-insight possessed by Australian project leaders when making this decision. Five project financing risk most frequently cited in the literature, namely: operating, environmental, market, political/regulation, and sponsors, were selected. Sixteen hypothetical risk pricing cases were structured, which were completed by twenty-five project leaders working in Sydney. The collected data was analysed, and the results show that the five project financing risks had strong impact on the project risk pricing decision. Among them, market risk is the most influential factor, followed by operating, sponsors, and political/regulation risks, while environmental risk was the factor with least effect. Very little support, however, was provided for the hypothesis that risk interactions impact the project risk pricing decision. Among the ten two-level risk interactions tested, only the interaction between sponsors and political/regulation was found to be significant.

However, recently the response of anurans to such conditions has been controversial and little empirical data are published on the response of Australian anurans living under such conditions. Limnodynastes Tasmaniensis is a medium sized endemic frog of the family Myobatrachidae that has an extensive range that encompasses every Australian state. Limited published data indicates that intra-population variation in reproductive parameters exist in this species and therefore it is an ideal model to test life history theory under Australian conditions. A population of the species was studied within remnant woodlands of North West Sydney, Australia. Many observations were made and the results shown in some detail. The data found does not completely conform with current theory developed largely for data collected in the northern hemisphere and highlights the need for further research into life history strategies of Australian anurans.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian frogs</field><field name="subject">anurans</field><field name="subject">Limnodynastes Tasmaniensis</field><field name="subject">Myobatrachidae</field><field name="subject">wildlife conservation</field><field name="subject">Cumberland Plain</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/692</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applications of solid-state 15N NMR spectroscopy to the study of nitrogen cycling in sub-tropical forest plantations</field><field name="creator">George, Laurel</field><field name="description">The aim of this research project was to use 15N nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to better understand nitrogen (N) cycling processes in forest plantations. In particular, the studies were designed to link to the effects of forest management practices and environmental conditions. 15N NMR cross polarization/magic angle spinning (CPMAS) and dipolar dephasing (DD)-CPMAS experiments of some simple N-containing compounds found widely in nature were first undertaken. This was done in order to understand how different sample conditions, such as the presence of moisture, sample mixing and dilution, affected the intensity and the observability of the NMR peaks corresponding to N containing functional groups. Our results exhibited changes in NMR signal intensities and various time constants calculated. In the case of variable contact time experiments, use of an equation that predicts both a bi-exponential rise and decay was found to fit the data obtained more accurately. The optimised parameters for 15N NMR CPMAS were then used along with other analytical techniques such as ion chromatography, total C and N and elemental analyses to study plant nutrient uptake, plant decomposition and the effect of forest ecosystem disturbances, in this case an insect infestation. These analytical data were also correlated with the changes in the 13C NMR spectra in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the chemical transformations in the forest ecosystem.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nitrogen cycle</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">nitrogen fertilizers</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">tree farms</field><field name="subject">forest management</field><field name="subject">forest ecology</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/39262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stories in the landscape : the sorry rock phenomenon and the cultural landscape of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park</field><field name="creator">Foxlee, Jasmine</field><field name="description">Each day the joint managers of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park receive packages of returned rocks and sand that have been removed from the landscape by visitors as a souvenir of the place.

Characters in many Australian novels are portrayed dancing on stage, dancing within the context of their everyday lives, watching corroborees, reminiscing about social dance events in distant homelands or gyrating under flashing lights at discos and raves. In other instances the word &#8220;dance&#8221; (or an associated term) is used metaphorically to convey actual or imagined movement such as the wind dancing in trees, or thoughts dancing in characters&#8217; minds. Although representations of dance in Australian novels portray qualities such as vitality, beauty and transcendence, this thesis argues that they also elucidate a shadowland of pain and suffering and sometimes an uncertainty about Australian culture and identity. Indigenous dancers are scrutinised critically by non-Indigenous spectators. Despite the bright lights and glamour of their world, professional dancers are shown to struggle against the persistence of the cultural cringe. Unflattering notions of class and gender taint the excitement and romance of social dance occasions, migrant characters associate dance with painful memories of abandoned homelands and dancers performing professionally or privately risk being labelled mad, feminine or homosexual (or all three). The metaphorical use of the word dance does not always portray vital movement but often conveys heaviness, awkwardness and even imminent collapse. Descriptions of dance are minimalist to the point where the dance almost disappears from the reader&#8217;s view. As well as making dance in Australian novels visible, the investigation conducted in this thesis sharpens awareness of its negative or &#8220;shadow&#8221; side and challenges the widespread critical glorification of the presence of dance in literature more generally.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dance in literature</field><field name="subject">dance</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian fiction</field><field name="subject">Australian literature</field><field name="subject">history and criticism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/39463</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The behaviour of cadmium in soil</field><field name="creator">Milham, Paul J.</field><field name="description">Long-term low-level ingestion of cadmium (Cd) causes human health problems, and in Australia, vegetables supply ~40% of the Cd in the typical diet. Plants take up Cd from the soil; however, the uptake is poorly predicted by simple soil tests, such as the total concentration of Cd (Cdt). Therefore, a greater understanding of Cd behaviour in soils is needed to improve the prediction of Cd uptake by plants and open a new path to minimise the risks for human health. The objectives of the research in this thesis were to: identify key soil properties affecting Cd behaviour, identify/develop selective methods to measure them, and to formulate a conceptual model of Cd partitioning. These objectives were based on the hypothesis that empirical modelling informed by a better understanding of Cd chemistry would accurately describe Cd partitioning in soil. To test the hypothesis, the key properties were measured on soils from the peri-urban fringe of Greater Sydney (n = 41) and a series of models of increasing complexity were fitted to the data. A model with three explanatory variables&#8212; log10 Cdt, pH and log10 ECEC (effective cation exchange capacity)&#8212;explained 94.6% of variation in log10 CdCa (the concentration of Cd in solution in a suspension of soil in 10 mM CaCl2), which strongly supported the hypothesis. The study also indicated that the explanatory variables, Cdt, pH and ECEC, may describe Cd behaviour in many soils, and that for these general models, partition coefficients, such as log10 (Cdt/CdCa), are unsuitable dependent variables. The preceding model used Cdt as an explanatory variable, notwithstanding that labile Cd (CdE) was mechanistically preferable. However, CdE can only be measured using isotopic techniques: a requirement that has constrained the evaluation of CdE as an index of Cd behaviour and bioavailability. Therefore, a simple proxy measure of CdE was investigated. The literature indicated that solutions of chloride salts might selectively extract CdE, and Cd extracted into 1 M NH4Cl (CdNH4Cl) was compared with CdE measured by stable isotope dilution ICPMS. For 23 soils from the partitioning study, 1 M NH4Cl failed to completely extract CdE, unless the pH was less than 5. The cause(s) of this effect will be investigated with the aim of developing a universally applicable measure of CdE that does not require isotopic measurements. All models of Cd uptake by plants rely on soil properties measured on homogenised samples, although the distribution and bioavailability of Cd vary spatially in the field. Were such variability to increase at the micro-scale, its effects could erode the accuracy with which models could predict Cd behaviour and uptake. Consequently, I tested whether the distribution of Cd could be mapped by using synchrotron micro-x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (micro- XRFS): the most sensitive method of observation. The soils examined contained 0.3&#8211;6.4 mg Cd/kg, i.e. were typical agricultural soils, and one was spiked to ~100 mg Cd/kg. Micro-XRFS mapped the Cd in the spiked soil, and in one particle in the other soils. For typical agricultural soils, the sensitivity realised in this study would have been sufficient to characterise the average Cd binding site, but fell at least 10-fold below that needed to map the Cd distribution in them. The research satisfied the objectives, advanced knowledge of Cd behaviour in soils, and provided new research leads. These leads include the possibility of developing general models of Cd partitioning in soils, derivatives of which may predict Cd uptake by plants. The accuracy of these models may be strengthened by the use of CdE as an explanatory variable, but may be weakened by the effects of in situ variation in the distribution of Cd. The benefits to human health of agricultural practices that decrease dietary Cd justify continuation of research to develop models that accurately predict Cd uptake by plants.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cadmium</field><field name="subject">toxicology</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">soils</field><field name="subject">cadmium content</field><field name="subject">soil absorption and adsorption</field><field name="subject">food crops</field><field name="subject">plants</field><field name="subject">effect of cadmium on</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/39519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of mobile phone electromagnetic field exposures on nervous function in the human brain and heart</field><field name="creator">D'Costa, Howard Francis</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to determine whether RF pulsed exposures from mobile phones can influence nervous function within the human brain and heart.  In order to address this objective, a robust double-blind study to investigate mobile phone exposures on nervous response has been undertaken by means of analysis of electrophysiological test measures of brain wave activity and heart responses.  Generally, test measurements of the electroencephalogram (EEG), the electrocardiogram (ECG), and the pulse plethysmogram (PPG) (for indications of blood pressure response) have been undertaken whilst participants are exposed and sham exposed to various GSM mobile phone radiofrequency and low-frequency protocols.  In initial work, both standby and full-power mode GSM exposures have been investigated (Chapter 3 - EEG investigated only), while pulsed 900 MHz and 1800 MHz continuous wave exposures have been investigated in the final experimental work involving 100 test participants (Ch apter 8 - EEG, ECG, and PPG measures are investigated).   Four predominant outcomes are determined from the final experimental work conducted.  These main outcomes specifically include:  1. A new 'characteristic' finding in the EEG alpha band (8-13 Hz) as due to 900 MHz exposures is observed from almost all recording sites, over both brain hemispheres.  Notably, this response only appears at 900 MHz, though is not observable for the 1800 MHz exposure;  2. An EEG effect due to both pulsed 900 MHz and 1800 MHz exposures notably appearing at 16 Hz is a new critical finding and is observed across both hemispheres.  Most importantly, at this beta rhythm only a decreasing tendency in EEG power can be noted for the 900 MHz exposure tested but only an increasing tendency in EEG power may be noted at 1800 MHz, suggesting that the direction of the effect in EEG power may be dependent on the RF component;  3. Effects at 900 MHz on the contralateral side to exposure at central, temporal, and parietal sites appear to indicate a common median difference response between sham and  exposure EEG spectral power density, which does not appear on the ipsilateral side to exposure;  4. As consistent with most previously published research, 900 MHz or 1800 MHz exposures pulsed at 217 Hz do not appear to alter heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), or blood pressure variability (BPV).  	   To reduce confounding factors and errors in experimental results, several novel approaches were developed as described (Chapters 4 - 8).  These approaches include the development and testing of an experimental handset to support multiple mobile phone signals, a comparative analysis of 900 MHz and 1800 MHz exposures (near the health protection limits) on the same group of participants in simultaneous experiments, development of a statistical analysis approach to EEG that addresses both type 1 and type 11 errors at high resolution, and quantification of potential effects of EEG recording leads on SAR and electric field distribution (at both 900 MHz and 1800 MHz) inside a SAM phantom and realistic computational head model.   Outcomes of this research address forefront international health concerns regarding almost 2-billion mobile phone users worldwide.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile phones</field><field name="subject">radiofrequency</field><field name="subject">EEG</field><field name="subject">ECG</field><field name="subject">leads</field><field name="subject">nervous-system</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090708.121453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preexercise strategies: the effects of warm-up, stretching, and massage on symptoms of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage and performance</field><field name="creator">Weerapong, Pornratshanee</field><field name="description">This thesis uncovers the rational and Romantic assumptions about the relationship between objects and identity that are embedded in occupational therapy, and critiques current practice from that perspective. It is based on an initial assumption that there is in fact a relationship between people's identity and the objects they make, have, use and are associated with. This assumption is explored through an interpretive examination of the fields of literature that are commonly identified as informing occupational therapy, supplemented by selected popular literature. The exploration takes a philosophical approach, guided by notions from philosophical hermeneutics, including pre-understandings, the hermeneutic circle and fusion of horizons. The conclusion reached is that people informed by Western philosophies interpret the identity meanings of objects in both rational and Romantic ways. To inform the study, the nature of rationalism and Romanticism are then explained, and the implications of these philosophical traditions in relation to objects and identity are teased out. This interpretation is guided by a history of ideas methodology, which entails approaching historical texts from a new perspective, in this case the identity meanings of objects. Thus informed, occupational therapy literature, primarily that published in Britain between 1938 and 1962 is examined from the perspective of objects and identity. What is revealed is that rational and Romantic understandings of objects, and of patients' and their own identity are clearly discernible. Such understandings afforded early occupational therapists both ways to organise their growing knowledge of the therapeutic application of crafts and the transformative outcomes of occupational therapy intervention. Gradually however, factors both internal and external to the profession served to undermine therapists' Romanticism. Primary amongst these were World War II, which saw a redeployment of occupational therapists from mental health to physical rehabilitation settings; advances in rehabilitative medicine, which brought a reduction in secondary complications and the adoption of teamwork; and the development of new practice areas including domestic rehabilitation using gadgets to enhance function and pre-vocational rehabilitation. As a result, tensions between rational and Romantic understandings crystallised around two long-standing controversies. These were whether or not craft equipment such as weaving looms should be adapted to serve specific remedial purposes, and whether it was the process of making a crafted object or the quality of the finished product that was more important. In the event, these contested ideologies became largely irrelevant as craftwork was sidelined from mainstream practice. With it, occupational therapists' Romantic vision of transforming people's lives through creative activity also slipped away. Several reasons for this loss of one of the profession's founding philosophies are proposed. They include the substantial absence of the professions' philosophical foundations from its education, and the paucity of theory and research methodologies that might have informed the nature and process of transformative change that earlier occupational therapists had observed and reported. The thesis concludes by arguing for the importance of recovering a balance between rationalism and Romanticism. A call to action is issued, addressing change in educational practice, concerted research effort to identify and articulate transformative processes within occupational therapy, and political action focusing on the inclusion of Romantic perspectives within policy and strategic documents.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stretching exercises</field><field name="subject">Massage</field><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Sports injuries</field><field name="subject">Exercise science</field><field name="subject">Injuries prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Uncovering "regimes of truth": locating and defining discourses associated with hydro-electric development in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wells, Philippa Katherine</field><field name="description">This thesis reveals and explores a history of the New Zealand present, providing insight into myths through which New Zealanders shape their perceptions and relationships with the world that surrounds them, and interrogating the concepts that support those myths. This myth referred to is a regime of truth based on perceptions of environmental responsibility, embodied in language, policy, actions, and incorporated into official discourse through imagery, an international government-driven advertising campaign portraying a "100% Pure New Zealand" and institutionalisation. There is a Department of Conservation, a Ministry for the Environment, National Parks and Reserves and a Resource Management Act based on a fundamental principle of sustainable management. Popular discourse also recognises environmental values - hence the appearance of concerted public and media campaigns against proposed development of coastal and timbered areas and the survival of lobby and pressure groups based on environmental causes such as opposition to genetic modification and the alienation of areas considered of natural significance. However, a study of relevant strains of discourse in the New Zealand environmental context reveals ruptures and reversals, inconsistencies and contradictions. The focus and meanings within discourse have changed; the position and power of the environment has been both affected by, and has affected, power relationships. At certain times and in particular social conditions, an environmental voice has been compelled to occupy a space on the outskirts of a dominant discourse and to comply with its discursive practices, as a way of gaining legitimisation. At others, an environmental discourse has gained a fleeting triumph, to be privileged as truth. From the official outset of European colonisation in 1840, a discourse grounded in such modernist values as technological optimism, economic progress and capitalism both framed and legitimised utterances of the colonists and grounded decisions that were to fundamentally and permanently affect the New Zealand physical environment. Themes that were to echo through the years in such discursive enunciations as acclimatisation and engineering were justified on the basis of "progress". Such themes included the presumption that "man" and fulfilment of "his" needs was the ultimate dictate, and that this could and would be achieved through scientific discovery and its application through engineering and arts. Only through such a pursuit could civilisation advance onwards and upwards along a never-ending path. Within such a discourse, Nature had no distinct or valid domain outside that of man, but was merely a storehouse of raw materials, to be dipped into by Man when and where desired. One of the most significant manifestations for New Zealand in the twentieth century of this modernist discourse has been the development of hydro-electricity. The availability of the necessary technology in a country boasting plentiful rainfall, numerous fast-flowing rivers, pockets of population and a tradition of socialist, centralist political philosophy shaped hydro-electricity as a metaphor for New Zealand-style civilisation - enabled and controlled through government decision-making. Consequently, a genealogical study of the discourses relating to hydro-electricity policy and debate can provide valuable insight into the power relations between those exercising power through a modernist discourse and an environmental resistance, and into strategies that were adopted or developed as part of such discourses in the exercise of power. In particular, a detailed study of specific examples permits the interplay of socio-temporal factors and practices to be appreciated. Hydro-electricity is thus the contextual focus selected in this thesis, a focus reflected in the title. The genealogical method involves uncovering and contextualising primary and secondary materials within their historical setting. Through the interrogation of such materials this approach contributes to a critical understanding of power relations and how those relations influence strategies that might be utilised in the exercise of power. Such a method was therefore selected to analyse the tensions implicit in discourse within three historically and contextually specific case studies. These case studies involved in chronological order the proposal to harness the waters of the Bowen Falls in Fiordland during the 1920s, the proposal to raise the level of Lake Manapouri (together with that of the neighbouring Lake Te Anau) in the 1960s, and finally the proposal to divert a large proportion of the mean water-flow of the Lower Waitaki river during the first part of the twenty-first century. A principal conclusion that is reached through the analysis is that the present environmental discourse in New Zealand is not the inevitable outcome of progressive and logical history. Nor can it be explained as chance or as a consequence of world changes, but is a function of power/knowledge. Changes in the regime of truth are therefore the outcome of a successful power strategy exercised by a resistance in challenging that regime of truth. In addition, what might be defined as "environmental discourse" in the New Zealand context is narrowly defined, limited by environmental cause, a cause shaped in turn by the language of conservation. The lesson from history is that the regime of truth of such a discourse is not an end, stable and unchanging for the future, but must be seen rather as brittle, uncertain and vulnerable to attack. A third conclusion that emerges from the hydro-electricity focus is that this particular discursive enunciation of a New Zealand-style modernist discourse was a metaphor for social and economic progress, thereby occupying a privileged position as truth. Finally, one of the important contributions to methodological debate made by the thesis lies in its application of the Foucauldian genealogical method in exploring the general history of a socio-temporal context, thereby uncovering power strategies effected through discourse. This in turn reveals the hidden events, the silent voices and the games played in establishing and challenging a regime of truth.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydroelectric power plants</field><field name="subject">Environmentalism</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing, contesting and consuming New Zealand's tourism landscape: a history of Te Wairoa</field><field name="creator">Bremner, Hamish</field><field name="description">The thesis focuses on documentation regarding the historical growth of tourism at Te Wairoa, Rotorua, New Zealand. Te Wairoa acted as a gateway to Otukapuarangi and Te Tarata of Rotomahana which represented an iconic tourism landscape in the nineteenth century. A theoretical engagement with tourism studies and the utilisation of history as an analytical device reveals that the consumption of the tourism landscape is an ongoing, contested, and negotiated cultural construction of place.The history of tourism development at Te Wairoa exhibits the entrenchment of European colonial power in New Zealand. However, within the structures of colonial authority, strategies of survival for the colonised are employed. In this particular case, the strategies include the engagement with Western ethics of capitalism, the manipulation and appropriation of symbols of the 'other', and the control of access through land ownership. The economic and social development of Te Wairoa, based on a tourism economy, also highlights the existent tensions in both a colonial and post-colonial relationship in New Zealand.The research further argues that individual tourism sites reflect culturally ascribed values associated with place. As the combination of exogenous and endogenous social, cultural, political and economic forces evolve so to does the production and consumption of the tourism landscape. Evidence for these considerations is provided by publicly available historical material including archival documents, historical literature, contemporary accounts, newspapers, and government records. The result is an in-depth study which provides an original and thematic interpretation of the history of Te Wairoa as well as supporting a model for investigating change in the cultural construction of place.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Within the web: the family/practitioner relationship in the context of chronic childhood illness</field><field name="creator">Dickinson, Annette R</field><field name="description">This study explores the phenomenon of the relationships between practitioners and families who have a child with a chronic illness.  Using a heremeneutic phenomenological method informed by the writings of Martin Heidegger [1889-1976] and Hans-Georg Gadamer [1900-2002], this study provides an understanding of the meaning of 'being in relationship' from the perspective of both families and practitioners.Study participants include ten family groups who have a child with a chronic illness and twelve practitioners from the disciplines of nursing, medicine, dietetics, physiotherapy and speech therapy who work with children with chronic illness.  Narrative audiotaped interviewing was the means by which the participants told their stories about times that relationships worked well and when they did not.  These stories uncover the every day realities of 'being in relationship' and provide another understanding of the relationship between family and practitioner.The findings of this thesis suggest that chronic childhood illness 'throws' families and practitioners together into a web of relationships that must work for the sake of the child.  The relationship is primarily conducted between adults.  Children are usually excluded.  In order to understand and manage the child's illness, practitioners and families 'go around' and act 'in-between' relationships.  While the quality of the relationship from the family perspective is not essential to the chronic illness journey, relationships are more successful when practitioners recognise the uniqueness of each family web.  The nature of the relationship is often simple, yet it co-exists with complexity.  This thesis proposes that a 'companion relationship' between practitioners and family may offer a more effective and satisfying way of working.  It also challenges practitioners to consider the voice of children within health care relationships.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chronic diseases in children</field><field name="subject">Parent and child</field><field name="subject">Family</field><field name="subject">Professional-Family Relations</field><field name="subject">Chronic Disease</field><field name="subject">Child</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family factors in bilingual children's code-switching and language maintenance: a New Zealand case study</field><field name="creator">Yu, Shanjiang</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to investigate family factors in relation to young Chinese immigrants' code-switching and language maintenance. Specific attention is given to children's code-switching behaviour and how parents respond and the effect of parental response upon children's language choice in any subsequent utterance. Attempts are also made to identify the family factors that might have an effect on making language choice. Data were collected monthly through naturalistic tape-recording of families' conversations for one calendar year. Recordings of every other month were transcribed and coded for analysis. A questionnaire was used with the children's parents to obtain general family background information as well as to compare the parents' language beliefs and their actual language behaviour in real life.Results indicated that within an average of 28.1 months of stay in New Zealand, the use of Mandarin Chinese, their ethnic language, was dramatically reduced. In typical family conversations, the parents were using Mandarin Chinese in only 75.6% of their conversational turns and that figure for the children was 65.1%. If the amount of mother tongue use at home is an indicator, then the speed of shift in these families investigated appears to be relatively fast. Few parents, however, felt that their children were using too much English or ever attempted to stop them doing this, despite the fact that all the parents claimed that they very much wanted their children to maintain the ethnic language and were fully aware of the importance of their role as the main input source of their ethnic language. This seems to suggest that the marketplace value of the mainstream language is overtaking the core value of their ethnic language.Results also showed that parental use of English caused a substantially increased use of English from their children. There tended to be an "upgrading" towards English in the children's language choice suggesting that code-switching could be a temporary stage for the children along the gradual process of language shift. On the other hand, the parents were also found using more English after their children's code-switching. One of the reasons for this might be that the parents want to improve their English and regard their children as an ideal person to practise English with.With regard to daily communication functions, results showed that children often resorted to English for daily speech acts indicating that language function replacement has occurred for many daily communicative functions resulting from a gradually reduced use of the ethnic language.Many family factors were found to be affecting language use in the families: the presence of grandparents and the decision to return to their birth country for residence in the future were clearly correlated with increased use of the ethnic language; the parents' level of English language, on the other hand, was found to be related to the amount of English used, though with exceptions.These results strongly suggest that English is taking over the family domains that used to belong to the ethnic language. Parents who want their children to maintain their ethnic language need to put daily effort into action. Without painstaking daily effort, language shift will and probably is happening no matter how strong their theoretical beliefs might be.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Language maintenance</field><field name="subject">Chinese language</field><field name="subject">Bilingualism in children</field><field name="subject">Family</field><field name="subject">Foreign Languages</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te hau ora o naga kaumatau o Tuhoe: a study of Tuhoe kaumatau mental wellness</field><field name="creator">McNeill, Hinematau</field><field name="description">Tuhoe is considered to be one of the last bastions of 'traditional' Maori language and culture. The main purpose of the research was to examine the mental health status of Tuhoe kaumatua (elderly). Even before the research was undertaken anecdotal evidence indicated that a significant feature of the Tuhoe aging population was the apparent absence of mental health problems. Kaumatua are however particularly susceptible to physical diseases that afflict modern Maori, regardless of geography or tribal origin. To explore the health status of Tuhoe kaumatua, the study needed to take into account external cultural influences and, in particular, the colonial experience. This justifies a comprehensive theoretical approach that includes European philosophical influences which, it will be argued, have impacted on Maori lifeways.  Notwithstanding, the study draws principally on Maori conceptualisations of the world, mainly because kaumatua mental wellness was considered to be inextricable to Tuhoe language and culture. The research attempted to isolate those factors that sustain kaumatua mental wellness. In determining the causal factors of wellness it soon became apparent that the practice of traditional Maori healing, embedded in ancient esoteric knowledge, was of considerable significance. This feature is apparent from the outset. The opening karakia of the Tuhoe tohunga (specialist/healer), Hohepa Kereopa invokes ancient Maori atua (Gods) and endows the work with an aura of spiritual protection. He has stipulated that both the karakia (prayer) and mihi (greeting) remain in Maori (Tuhoe dialect) because he believes that the essence of these rituals are best preserved in the Maori language.  Throughout this entire body of work Hohepa Kereopa maintains a discernible and enduring presence.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="subject">Tuhoe (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kupu</field><field name="subject">Kaumatua</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between objects and identity in occupational therapy: a dynamic balance of rationalism and romanticism</field><field name="creator">Hocking, Clare</field><field name="description">This thesis uncovers the rational and Romantic assumptions about the relationship between objects and identity that are embedded in occupational therapy, and critiques current practice from that perspective. It is based on an initial assumption that there is in fact a relationship between people's identity and the objects they make, have, use and are associated with. This assumption is explored through an interpretive examination of the fields of literature that are commonly identified as informing occupational therapy, supplemented by selected popular literature. The exploration takes a philosophical approach, guided by notions from philosophical hermeneutics, including pre-understandings, the hermeneutic circle and fusion of horizons. The conclusion reached is that people informed by Western philosophies interpret the identity meanings of objects in both rational and Romantic ways. To inform the study, the nature of rationalism and Romanticism are then explained, and the implications of these philosophical traditions in relation to objects and identity are teased out. This interpretation is guided by a history of ideas methodology, which entails approaching historical texts from a new perspective, in this case the identity meanings of objects. Thus informed, occupational therapy literature, primarily that published in Britain between 1938 and 1962 is examined from the perspective of objects and identity. What is revealed is that rational and Romantic understandings of objects, and of patients' and their own identity are clearly discernible. Such understandings afforded early occupational therapists both ways to organise their growing knowledge of the therapeutic application of crafts and the transformative outcomes of occupational therapy intervention. Gradually however, factors both internal and external to the profession served to undermine therapists' Romanticism. Primary amongst these were World War II, which saw a redeployment of occupational therapists from mental health to physical rehabilitation settings; advances in rehabilitative medicine, which brought a reduction in secondary complications and the adoption of teamwork; and the development of new practice areas including domestic rehabilitation using gadgets to enhance function and pre-vocational rehabilitation. As a result, tensions between rational and Romantic understandings crystallised around two long-standing controversies. These were whether or not craft equipment such as weaving looms should be adapted to serve specific remedial purposes, and whether it was the process of making a crafted object or the quality of the finished product that was more important. In the event, these contested ideologies became largely irrelevant as craftwork was sidelined from mainstream practice. With it, occupational therapists' Romantic vision of transforming people's lives through creative activity also slipped away. Several reasons for this loss of one of the profession's founding philosophies are proposed. They include the substantial absence of the professions' philosophical foundations from its education, and the paucity of theory and research methodologies that might have informed the nature and process of transformative change that earlier occupational therapists had observed and reported. The thesis concludes by arguing for the importance of recovering a balance between rationalism and Romanticism. A call to action is issued, addressing change in educational practice, concerted research effort to identify and articulate transformative processes within occupational therapy, and political action focusing on the inclusion of Romantic perspectives within policy and strategic documents.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Occupational therapy</field><field name="subject">Identity (Philosophical concept)</field><field name="subject">Rationalism</field><field name="subject">Romanticism</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Obtaining business benefits from IT: factors that influence the adoption of benefit realisation methodologies in New Zealand organisations</field><field name="creator">Kodthuguli, Saritha</field><field name="description">Almost without exception organisations have become reliant on Information Systems (IS) and Information Technology (IT) applications. Although competitive advantage, task efficiency and effective information management are considered to be among the major drivers for investing in IS/IT, recognising, valuing and realising these expected business benefits from their investments has proved to be a complex task for organisations. The track record of the IS/IT industry shows that there are high rates of project failures, budget overruns and cancellations, resulting in the so-called IT productivity paradox. Researchers argue that the current evaluation techniques (primarily financial) are insufficient to identify, track and evaluate benefits obtained through IS/IT projects. Therefore they encourage organisations to employ non-financial techniques that are apparently more suitable for IS/IT investments. There is still much debate, however, concerning the efficiency and effectiveness of the current evaluation techniques in terms of satisfying the IS/IT investment evaluation criteria.Benefit realisation (BR) approaches are among the non-financial techniques suggested by some in order to facilitate organisations to track, identify, measure and optimise business benefits from IS/IT projects. It appears, however, that most organisations worldwide have failed to change their practices, in part due to managerial perspectives and uncertainty of the effectiveness of BR models.The situation in New Zealand in relation to BR is unknown. This research therefore focuses on analysing the perspectives of IT and business/finance managers' towards their current IS/IT practices. Thereby to investigate the influence of three key factors, awareness, use and effectiveness of BR models those were identified from past studies, in New Zealand business context.In order to assess these factors, this exploratory study employed a positivist cross-sectional survey approach and selected five hundred IT-enabled New Zealand organisations across a variety of industry sectors, sizes and localities as the main sample. The results describe local perspectives on current IS/IT evaluation practices and on formal BR models in use. The report further compares and contrasts IT and finance managers' views towards organisations' current IS/IT practices and BR approaches. Finally concludes with recommendations for practice and implications for further research.Although the survey received relatively low levels of response, some preliminary outcomes are evident. The main insight obtained through this study is that among the responding organisations, awareness of formal benefit realisation and use of formal BR models are fairly low. In spite of this low awareness, there is some evidence of the presence of BR practice among nearly one-third of IT respondents and almost half of finance respondents, who indicated the use of in-house developed models. Some of the in-house models encompass important aspects of formal BR approaches. However the extent of their use varies significantly.Many of the responding organisations, in acknowledging their limited awareness of BR, indicated a desire to know more about the formal methods available. Moreover this research's findings are consistent with the similar studies conducted in Australia and UK. Therefore this study emphasises the need for improvement of NZ organisations' current IS/IT practice by incorporating a BR approach in order to better optimise business benefits from IS/IT. This study recommends that organisations identify the missing links in their current practices through a conceptual framework suggested here and to improve their awareness (and likely adoption) of BR in order to better optimise their business benefits and justify their investments in IS/IT.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information technology</field><field name="subject">Evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/12</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing the adoption and usage of internet banking: a New Zealand perspective</field><field name="creator">Podder, Braja</field><field name="description">Although the offering of financial products and services over the Internet by banks and financial institutions continues to spread, reports on Internet banking show that the adoption and usage of such services by consumers are low. Further, relatively little empirical research has been carried out to examine factors influencing users' adoption or use of Internet banking services, particularly in New Zealand. Hence, there is a need to identify relevant factors that influence New Zealand's bank customers' intentions to use Internet banking. This research used two commonly applied and empirically supported models of information technology adoption to achieve this objective. In this study, Davis's (1989) technology acceptance model (TAM) is extended by two external variables, namely risk and self-efficacy. The second model used is a reduced version of Moore and Benbasat's (1991) perceived characteristics of innovation (PCI) model, without the image and voluntariness constructs. A questionnaire was used to conducting a postal survey of 1000 individuals in Auckland, New Zealand. Out of 163 responses received 157(15.7%) were usable and with this data both research models were tested.The results reveal that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, self-efficacy, relative advantage, compatibility, and result demonstrability have a significant association with intention to use Internet banking, while risk, visibility and trialability are not significant. Both the modified TAM and PCI models used in the study have a similar explanatory power of slightly over 20% of the variance in intention. In the TAM model, perceived usefulness and self-efficacy are significant variables, while compatibility is the only variable significant for the PCI model. Further, results indicate that users' perceptions of various aspects of Internet banking are more positive than non-users' perceptions, except for risk.The results of this study indicate that both TAM and PCI have low capabilities in explaining the variances in users' intention to adopt or use Internet banking services. Therefore, further studies are recommended to examine the performance of these models in Internet banking studies and also to improve the prediction power of these models by incorporating additional constructs. Although risk is found to be insignificant in this study, considering results of prior studies, further studies are required to examine its influence on intention.For banks point of view, banks should consider launching campaigns to demonstrate the usefulness and benefits. Once users perceive that advantages outweigh disadvantages, they are more likely to adopt or use Internet banking. Additionally, banks must make continuous effort to understand consumers' requirement and design and deliver their products and services in such a way that it is consistent with customers' requirements, beliefs and the way customers are accustomed to work. Banks website should facilitate customers with a 'one stop comprehensive financial' service. Banks can arrange hands-on training for prospective users to enhance their self-efficacy or may pay additional interest on online-deposit accounts (can be access through Internet only). Besides promoting services, banks need to invest in staff education and training and be equipped with advanced computer technology.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet banking</field><field name="subject">Information Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/45</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lesbian mothers: queer families: the experience of planned pregnancy</field><field name="creator">Bree, Caroline</field><field name="description">Lesbian-identified women are choosing to become parents in increasing numbers. This 'lesbian baby boom' has implications for midwives and their practice. The purpose of this study was to gain insight and understanding of planned pregnancy from a lesbian perspective, in order to facilitate the provision of appropriate care for lesbian mothers and their families.The methodology used for the study was radical hermeneutics informed by lesbian feminism and queer poststructuralism. Purposive sampling identified ten lesbian-identified mothers and conversational interviews with the participants yielded rich data about the phenomenon of inquiry. Thematic analysis of the data was foregrounded by a discussion of the socio-political context.A number of findings emerged from the study. Careful pre-conceptual planning reflected a highly responsible approach to parenting. The women's partners felt uncertain about their parenting role and experienced a lack of acknowledgement by the wider community. Despite legal access to assisted fertility, the participants usually sought an involved father for their child. Lesbian mothers expressed a preference for a lesbian midwife and all experienced homophobic attitudes from healthcare professionals. Queer families included mothers and their partners, fathers and their partners, children, families-of-origin, and close friends.Recommendations from the study include the provision of safe and supportive workplaces for lesbian-identified midwives, the use of inclusive language such as partner and parent, acknowledgement of the woman's partner as a co-parent, midwifery resources featuring same-sex parents and midwifery education covering diverse family forms.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lesbian mothers</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Birth control</field><field name="subject">Gay parents</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/51</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The window: an experimental short film about a man who lives his life in darkness</field><field name="creator">Jain, Priti</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the potential of typography as a significant visual element in the narration of a short film.

Using the qualitative methodology of phenomenology, specifically that outlined by van Manen, it seeks to show how students act ethically within everyday practice.Ethics is vital to any health related profession and the growing complexity of New Zealand's health care system requires more responsibility for ethical decision making in nursing care. Providing nursing care is an ethically charged undertaking and despite ethics taking an increasingly important place in nursing education few studies show the contextual nature of ethical practice from the perspective of students. This study aims to partly redress this situation.In this study I have interpreted the experiences of twelve pre-registration students. Using seventeen stories shared by the student participants, my personal understandings and literature, the meaning of being ethical has been illuminated. Three themes emerged from the interpretation. These include 'keeping things 'nice'', 'being true to yourself' and 'being present'. This thesis asserts that the overarching theme within these themes is that of 'being constrained and enabled'. Being constrained shows the experiences of students as they live through the tensions of being and doing as they strive to be ethical. Being enabled shows the experience of self-determination. Finally the study maintains that the shaping of ethical practice for undergraduate students may be enhanced when their reality is positioned and valued within educational processes.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing students</field><field name="subject">Nursing ethic</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/75</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The game is not the same: a history of professional rugby in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Martin, Gerard John</field><field name="description">Rugby, an intensely physical team game that emphasised the contribution of players of disparate skills and strengths, was ideal for New Zealand's early European pioneers. It also suited the nature of the indigenous people. Rugby club competitions and provincial matches provided a significant social fulcrum and a means of playing out regional rivalries. Arduous, but ultimately successful rugby tours to Britain and Ireland, brought Pakeha and Maori together and helped to shape the young colony's self-image. New Zealand's commitment to its national game became instrumental in rugby's steadily growing international popularity.Although rugby had significant commercial appeal, it remained an amateur sport in deference to its British originators. Nevertheless, New Zealand's hosting of the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987 coincided with the development of global media networks. By the third Rugby World Cup tournament in 1995, substantial commercial interest in the game meant that a transition to a professional structure was inevitable. Rugby appealed to media conglomerates needing new televisual product that would attract subscribers to growing pay-TV networks.Although the introduction of professionalism was a major commercial success, the commercial imperatives imposed allowed rugby to be dominated by those with the most financial and player resources. As a consequence, New Zealand's traditional advantages were diluted. This generated considerable tension between New Zealand's professional game and its amateur grassroots level that has been rugby's traditional base. While supplying the game's players and supporters, grassroots rugby has been the level of the game most vulnerable to the negative impact of professionalisation.To generate the income to adequately fund the game's grassroots, it is critical that New Zealand's leading teams remain among the world's best. However, the professionalisation of rugby has made winning far more difficult than ever before. New Zealand rugby's challenge is to mitigate the commercial imperatives that place it at a significant disadvantage in the international game.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rugby football</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Professional sports</field><field name="subject">Television and sports</field><field name="subject">Communication studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/82</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The future of history: cultural heritage tourism in Guangdong</field><field name="creator">Huang, Lu</field><field name="description">This thesis studies aspects of cultural heritage tourism in China. Relevant secondary tourism data in relation to tourist receipts and income generated from tourism activities are provided so as to present the different developmental state of the world and Chinese cultural heritage tourism. The thesis identifies that although many academic tourism researchers have discussed the cultural heritage issues, there is a gap that no English paper is available to identify the differences between current English and Chinese academic tourism studies in relation to cultural heritage issues. Cultural heritage issues studied by the current Chinese academic tourism researchers are limited to the World Heritage Sites inscribed by UNESCO, and local significant cultural heritage sites are left untouched. In this case, the English and Chinese literature in relation to cultural heritage, management and tourism product issues are reviewed and the gap that no English literature is available to discuss the different academic foci is filled. Secondly, a local cultural heritage site, Chen Ancestor's Temple, located in the southern part of China, is selected as the case study so as to challenge the current Chinese cultural heritage tourism study focus. A new direction which advocates the Chinese academic tourism researchers to turn their focus on local significant cultural heritage sites is established. To examine the current cultural heritage tourism in Chen Ancestor's Temple, two research methodologies are employed so as to gather first hand data. Quantitatively, a survey of tourist behaviors--before, during and after visitation of Chen Ancestor's Temple is conducted so as to supplement the statistics available and get to know more about Chen Ancestor's Temple current tourism development. Qualitatively, the in-depth interviews are conducted so as to investigate the issues of five stakeholder groups in relation to the development and management issues of Chen Ancestor's Temple. Themes are identified from the issues concerned by the five stakeholder groups and some recommendations are thus made.In all, this thesis compares the existing cultural heritage tourism literature in English and Chinese so as to advance the overall state of knowledge. The study of Chen Ancestor's Temple makes a further advance by establishing a new direction for Chinese academic tourism scholarship so as to focus towards locally significant cultural heritage sites.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cultural property</field><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="subject">Heritage tourism</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowing reality: psychotherapists' and counsellors' experiences and understandings of inexplicable phenomena while working with clients</field><field name="creator">Rosenberg, Linde</field><field name="description">This hermeneutic phenomenological study explores eight psychotherapists' and counsellors' experiences and understandings of 'inexplicable' phenomena that sometimes occur when working with clients.The purpose of the study is to stimulate thinking about these experiences and bring them into conversation within the psychoanalytic community.The findings emerging from this research reveal that inexplicable phenomena may occur when therapists and counsellors are in an 'open', meditative state in which the boundaries between self and the world seem lessened and time and space are experienced differently. The phenomena may take many forms, including the apparent knowing about events that are later reported by clients, which it would not have been possible to 'sense' in the usual way, and the seeing of semi-solid forms, which may be static or moving.The meanings made of the experiences vary according to different spiritual and theoretical worldviews but, invariably, the experiences are interpreted as receiving a communication from, or being attuned to, the unconscious mind or a spiritual intelligence or source of knowledge. This is discussed in relation to psychotherapeutic, phenomenological and spiritual literature.

The first case study, an urban and a rural/forested stream in New Zealand, measured descriptors of water quality, including nutrients, dissolved oxygen and bacterial indicators of faecal contamination. The urban and rural catchments have stream-water qualities that fail to meet standards for fish life or bathing. Of the five sites studied, only one catchment, which had a substantial forest component (50%), had bacterial counts which meet the Australian Recreational Water-quality Guidelines for Secondary Contact (Faecal coliforms and enterococci, ANZECC, 2000) and the New Zealand Interim Guidelines for Freshwater Bathing (Escherichia coli, MofE, 2000). Only one site (which was downstream of a sediment-detention dam) had water clarity which met the Ministry of the Environment's (MofE, 1994) guideline for contact recreation.The results from this New Zealand case study indicate that the absence of riparian vegetation altered the temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen regime, that livestock increased levels of nitrate, turbidity and bacteria indicators of faecal contamination and that urban land use increased peak flows, peak-flow turbidity and bacterial indicators of faecal contamination and decreased base flows.The second case study, of a stream in the former Deutsche Demokratische Republik (East Germany), measured a similar suite of parameters and compared the German stream's 2001 water quality with records from 1991 (directly after the reunification of Germany). Measured levels of total nitrogen, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate and dissolved oxygen all showed significant improvements between 1991 and 2001. Stricter controls and regulations are thought to be the cause.The final case study reviews plans for an urban residential development in the catchment of the New Zealand rural/forested stream. Degraded sections of the stream could actually be improved if the development is sensibly managed. However, the sensitive nature of the receiving environment (a marine reserve) requires that measures be taken to avoid or mitigate any deleterious effects. Plans by the relevant authority, the North Shore City Council, are a major step forward from the unsustainable development of the neighbouring catchment. Still, more needs to be done. Ten recommendations have been made to ameliorate the potential negative impacts of the development.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rivers</field><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="subject">Pollution</field><field name="subject">Enviornmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Television New Zealand's Charter: the struggle between social responsibilities and commercial imperatives</field><field name="creator">Teoh, Elna</field><field name="description">The research for this thesis started just before the TVNZ Charter was released in 2001. It followed the discussion regarding the new direction for the broadcaster to follow a more public service role. The data gathering was conducted through to post Charter implementation and captured the uncertainty surrounding the shift in policy. Although the aim of the TVNZ Charter was to raise the standards of public service broadcasting the introduction of this new policy was marked by confusion as to how this would be achieved, funded and monitored.The TVNZ Charter was introduced with the prescription that TVNZ find a balance in achieving public service needs in television as well as maintaining the revenue from advertising. This was because the government was not willing to provide sufficient funding for a non-commercial service and hence the result was always to be a hybrid model. It was frequently emphasized that Charter programmes should rate well and there was strong stress on the importance of retaining and attracting audiences.The core changes leading to the introduction of the TVNZ Charter owe their origins to the major policy turning point of 1989/1990, when broadcasting was deregulated in New Zealand. The free market provided programmes with a focus on entertainment and the previous dictum that they should also educate and inform was no longer spelled out in the Broadcasting Act. As only one of the traditional principles of television was being satisfied, there was a measurable decline in programmed diversity and it is argued, quality. The freedom of deregulation allowed TVNZ to pursue the goal of earning as much advertising revenue as possible. Therefore, the TVNZ Charter was hailed as a significant change of direction to ensure that public service needs were met.Even though it can be argued that many positive changes have resulted since the TVNZ Charter was mooted, it is argued that the drive to reposition TVNZ as a public service broadcaster seems to have resulted in a very diluted form of public service broadcasting. A major shift in direction has been compromised by a fear that significant changes in programming would result in a dramatic loss of vital advertising revenue.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Television broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Public service broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Broadcasting policy</field><field name="subject">Government funding vs advertising</field><field name="subject">Local content</field><field name="subject">New Zealand broadcasting history</field><field name="subject">Media</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drawing from voice: an exploration of sound in search of representational codes of the unseen</field><field name="creator">Williams, Carolyn</field><field name="description">This project explores the unseen (that which is not considered) in relation to the idea of the existence of another dimension of language.

This study drew upon the theoretical insights of Michel Foucault to provide a discursive analysis of the term euthanasia, and the issues surrounding the "right-to-die". It involved an analysis of primary texts from; nursing, general, and legal literature as well as the media between the years 2002-2004. Drawing upon data researched, the study analyses the main discourses regarding the practice of euthanasia for terminally ill individuals. The two competing discourses that emerged were what I have termed the sanctity-of life-discourse and the right-to-die discourse. The aim of the study was to uncover the discourses understanding of "truth" regarding the right-to-die. The analysis revealed that a small percentage of cancer sufferers (5%) die with their pain insufficiently treated and the right-to-die discourse claims that no individual should have to suffer needlessly, asserting the individuals right to autonomy. Directly opposing this is the sanctity-of life-discourse which states all life is sacred and nothing can justify euthanasia as an acceptable practice in society. My findings indicate the need for effective palliative care and pain management when caring for the terminally ill individual. The legal, ethical and moral implications of euthanasia are many and this study discusses the effects these may have on health professionals involved with the care of terminally ill patients. The study revealed an increasing deployment of the right-to-die discourse in the media and revealed concerns regarding the nursing professions lack of preparation to deal with euthanasia if it becomes a legal option in end of life care.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Euthanasia</field><field name="subject">Moral and ethical aspects</field><field name="subject">Terminally ill</field><field name="subject">Pain</field><field name="subject">Right to die</field><field name="subject">Life and death, power over</field><field name="subject">Palliative treatment</field><field name="subject">Health studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building trust to work with: a grounded theory study of paediatric acute care nurses work</field><field name="creator">Hall, Julianne</field><field name="description">Grounded theory methodology has guided the grounded theory methods used to explore the acute care paediatric nurses' perspective of what they do when a child has had a severe accident. The research was initiated from the experience of nursing children in the context of a rehabilitation centre and wondering how acute care nurses promoted a child's recovery after a severe unintentional injury.Many avenues were used to search international and New Zealand literature but the scarcity of literature related to what acute care paediatric nurses do was evident. Therefore this research has the potential of informing the speciality practice of acute care pediatric nursing.Nursing children in the acute care ward after a severe accident is complex. It encompasses nursing the family when they are experiencing a crisis. It is critical that the acute care nurse monitors and ensures the child's physiological needs are met, and the nurse "works with" the child to maintain and advance medical stability. Nursing interactions are an important part of "working with", communication is the essence of nursing. This research has focussed on the nurses' social processes whilst caring for the physical needs of the child and interacting with the family and multidisciplinary team when appropriate.An effective working-relationship with a nurse and family is founded on trust. Trust is an accepted part of our day-to-day lives and how to develop a trusting working-relationship with the child and family has not been explored prior to this research. Grounded theory methods supported the process of exploring the social processes of "building trust" whilst "working with" families in a vulnerable position. Nurses rely on rapport to be invited into a family's space to "work with" and support the re-establishment of the parenting role. The "stepping in and out" of an effective working-relationship with a family is reliant on trust. Nurses build trust by spending time to "be with", using chat to get to know each other, involving and supporting the family to parent a "different" child and reassuring and giving realistic hope to help the child and parents cope with their changed future.A substantive theory of the concept of "building trust to work with" has been developed using grounded theory methods. The theory has been conceptualized using the perspective of seven registered nurses working in paediatric acute care wards that admit children who have had a severe traumatic accident.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pediatric nursing</field><field name="subject">Pediatric intensive care</field><field name="subject">Trust</field><field name="subject">Acute Disease - nursing</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/145</field></doc><doc><field name="title">He matatika Maori: Maori and ethical review in health research</field><field name="creator">Hudson, Maui</field><field name="description">Maori aspirations for a better future are inextricably linked to their health and well-being. Research is a central element of any strategy to ensure that the inequalities of today will not be experienced by Maori children of the future. Kaupapa Maori research has been at the forefront of the indigenous challenge to Western research practices which continue to frame Maori as the 'other' and victim blame by measuring differences to non-Maori and then attribute identified negative differences to Maori deficit. A kaupapa Maori framework validates Maori realities and enables the development of research processes that are based on a Maori worldview and endorse Maori values and beliefs. Proponents of distinctly Maori research methodologies have questioned the appropriateness of ethical review processes that are based on Western concepts of ethics that they contend are incongruent with Maori cultural values and beliefs. Maori ethical issues identified in the literature that arise from this interface have similarities with indigenous ethical themes of respect, control and reciprocity. This qualitative research study was based on a kaupapa Maori approach. The research addressed two main research questions: whether the current system of ethical review in New Zealand is responsive to Maori and how can tikanga Maior inform Maori research ethics. Primary data for this study was drawn from interviews with Maori members of ethics committees and analysed thematically. The major conclusion of this study was that the current ethical review process is limited in its responsiveness to Maori. The research found that Maori values were generally marginalised within ethical review processes that are based on universal ethics derived from a Western value base. A number of key ethical issues for Maori are not addressed appropriately within the current system of ethical review due to the limited parameters, in Maori terms, of the review process. It is essential that Maori issues and concerns be addressed in order for Maori to benefit from the activities of the research sector. Differences exist between Maori and Western concepts of ethics and the inclusion of tikanga Maori within the ethical review process could lead to a more transparent and responsive evaluation and greatly enhance the quality of ethical review of health research in New Zealand. The development of a Maori ethical framework that describes the principles of tikanga Maori and their application within the context of research ethics could provide a culturally appropriate framework for ethical review. Such a framework would address ethical issues of significance for Maori in research. The establishment of a National Maori Ethics Committee and the development of a parallel Maori ethical review pathway would further enhance Maori responsiveness.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">Research</field><field name="subject">Methodology</field><field name="subject">Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Research</field><field name="subject">Hauora</field><field name="subject">Kupu</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The price of spiritual and social survival: investigating the reasons for the departure of young New Zealand-born Samoans from a South Auckland Samoan Seventh-day Adventist Church</field><field name="creator">Tunufa'i, Laumua Fata</field><field name="description">This study seeks to determine the reasons for the departure of New Zealand-born Samoans from a South Auckland traditional Samoan Seventh-day Adventist church. The concept of SURVIVAL: Exposure, Exit, and Reinvestment Model is used to explain the two factors instrumental in these young people's decisions to depart from the church. The first factor, which is a push factor, is the atmosphere at church, or what I refer to in this study as exposure. The second factor, which is a pull factor, involves the benefits of reinvesting their time and talents in other churches or in other non-church related activities. The results of this study strongly indicate that the church atmosphere was neither conducive nor promising, but very antagonistic to developing New Zealand-born Samoan young people's spiritual and social journeys. Consequently, the situation at church made these young people look elsewhere for social and spiritual survival. An analysis of the data suggests that the church can reverse the problem of departure by putting in place an active and effective system whereby the concerns and ideas of New Zealand-born Samoans as well as other youths are shared, heard, and rightly understood by the elders and the leadership of the church.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Samoans</field><field name="subject">Religion</field><field name="subject">Christianity and culture</field><field name="subject">Pacific Islanders</field><field name="subject">Cultural assimilation</field><field name="subject">Social Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/167</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Envy amongst psychotherapists in a psychotherapeutic community: a hermeneutic inquiry</field><field name="creator">Land, Crea M</field><field name="description">My research explores the lived experience of envy amongst psychotherapists and between psychotherapists in a psychotherapeutic community in New Zealand. It focuses on bringing the experience of envy out of hiddenness and into language.It then explores the understandings and the possibilities of meanings that these experiences have. Previous literature on envy has for the most part discussed the clients' envy for the psychotherapist, and very little has been written about the therapists' envy for the client. My research turns the focus to the psychotherapist as it looks at their envy for each other.As I was interested in the therapists' lived experiences of envy, I chose hermeneutic phenomenology as the methodology to explore these. I drew on the philosophical underpinnings offered by Heidegger, Gadamer and van Manen.What arose from my in-depth conversations with psychotherapists is that while envy is an experienced phenomenon that is for the most part not spoken, the powerful feelings that it evokes have great impact on both those who envy and those who are envied. Envy showed up as arising in a relational context, with perception, time and anxiety as contextual determinants. These, along with the findings of the lived experience of envy as a binding between self and other, as threatening to self and other and as a means of connecting with self and other, are some of the essential points discussed in my thesis.This study provides a starting point for a further exploration of the experience of envy amongst psychotherapists as well as envy's impact on who we are in ourselves and how we are with each other, both personally and professionally.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychotherapists</field><field name="subject">Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Envy</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/169</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A familiar villain: surveillance, ideology and popular cinema</field><field name="creator">Brown, Felicity Adair</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the representations of surveillance in mainstream cinema. Using ideology critique it will show how filmic illustrations of monitoring depoliticize the relationship between surveillance and structural relations of power.In order to provide a foundation for this inquiry, a political economy critique of surveillance will be undertaken in four areas. Focusing on the workplace, consumer surveillance, urban policing and intelligence gathering, this thesis will contextualise surveillance as historically relevant and intimately connected with modern constructs such as the nation-state, military power and capitalist economic organisation. In recent years, the role of surveillance has been intensified in response to the challenges posed by globalization, the restructuring of capitalism in the 1980's and 90's and the declining legitimacy of nation-state governments. These developments are both aided by, and in turn promote, pervasive networks of surveillance. Driven by risk management and other forms of economic reasoning as organisational logic, developments in information communication technologies accelerate surveillance capabilities rendering them more invasive and intense. In this way, surveillance can be conceived of as complicit with prevailing relations of power on a macro, sociological level.In order to show how mainstream cinematic representations of surveillance ideologically obscure this relationship, this thesis begins with an overview of 30 popular films. It then moves to a comparison of four recent Hollywood portrayals of surveillance with the four areas of political economy critique identified above. This analysis will reveal that these films have a tendency to focus on sentimental themes such as individual heroism, antagonist versus protagonist struggles and romantic subplots, in a way which deflects attention from collective experience with surveillance webs. More pertinently, the narrative structures of these films feature dichotomies between malevolent and benevolent monitoring, aligning legitimate and benign surveillance with the state. At the same time, the accompanying imagery of surveillance devices fetishizes monitoring, deterministically glorifying technology as a powerful and omniscient force. The overall effect is to depoliticize monitoring as a natural part of the fabric of everyday life.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motion pictures - political aspects</field><field name="subject">Privacy, Right of</field><field name="subject">Power (Social sciences)</field><field name="subject">Intelligence service</field><field name="subject">Electronic surveillance</field><field name="subject">Communication studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/182</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Code-switching and identity on the blogs: an analysis of Taglish in computer mediated communication</field><field name="creator">Smedley, Frank</field><field name="description">This study analyses the code-switching variety Taglish (Tagalog-English) in personal weblogs written by Filipino bloggers.The main research questions are set forth in chapter one: why do writers of weblogs code-switch in contexts where there is no specific addressee and hence no turn taking, and why is 'this' particular language chosen at 'this' juncture in the weblog narrative?Chapter two gives an overview of relevant code-switching theory and research, and focuses especially on the sociolinguistic dimensions. In particular, the markedness model of Myers-Scotton is reviewed with respect to the notion of code-switching itself as an unmarked choice. This sets the stage for introducing Taglish as a normal and unmarked phenomenon for many Filipinos.Chapter three presents the socio-political and linguistic background in the Philippines. This give a backdrop for a focus on the evolution and status of Taglish.The problems associated with the presentation of self in Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) are examined in Chapter four and then the unique characteristics of weblogs are explored with respect to their purpose and genre.Chapter five looks at the design and methodology employed and emphasises the qualitative nature of the research and the sampling method as purposive. The main corpus of 25 extracts were analysed using frameworks which bring important perspectives to bear on the use of code-switching in the construction and negotiation of identity. These frameworks are: the referee design dimension of Bell's audience design model with its emphasis on initiative style shifts to project different identities; discursive psychology which highlights the use of language to position self and others; and narrative psychology with its stress on people's use of narrative to seek coherence of self and life-experience. These frameworks are combined with Bakhtinian notions of polyphony, dialogism and heteroglossia.Chapter six gives the detailed results of the analysis of seven weblogs which typify the findings of the corpus. Code-switching on these weblogs highlights the creative end of language use. However, it is a creativity tempered by the realities of Bakhtinian heteroglossia. The heteroglossic nature of the code-switching, in seemingly monological texts, is implicated in how the bloggers negotiate and construct social identities by positioning themselves and others in the ongoing narrative flow. In that the code-switching is extremely plentiful in this non-oral environment, it poses a serious challenge to the attempts by some conversational analysts (e.g., Li, 2005) to claim that code-switching can only really be explicated in terms of the systematics of an interaction taking place. The research seeks to stay within the spirit of CA by suggesting that even in a seemingly monologic form, interaction may be reconceived as heteroglossia covertly present in all language and overtly manifest in switching. Thus switching is not merely a product of how speakers attend to the orderly production of conversation, but also a product of how they attend to the inherent heteroglossic nature of language and exploit their linguistic repertoire maximally to make their communication as effective as possible, and to construct and negotiate multiple identities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blogs</field><field name="subject">Tagalog language</field><field name="subject">Code switching (Linguistics)</field><field name="subject">Foreign Languages</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/186</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breaking the silence: a critical analysis of integrating a community level intervention model within a domestic violence public awareness campaign in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Batistich, Christina</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns domestic violence in New Zealand. Its aim is to help find effective ways of preventing domestic violence in our homes through community level public education/awareness interventions. Domestic violence has a damaging effect within a large number of New Zealand households; the primary aim of this thesis is to contribute research to the efforts in New Zealand directed at preventing domestic violence.This thesis situates domestic violence within both a sociological and theoretical framework as well as within the context of New Zealand public education campaigns. Central to this thesis is a critical analysis of one particular community level public education and awareness intervention that was implemented in the United States throughout the 1990s. The core community-level principles of this US project have been analysed with regard to the suitability of integrating them into a hypothetical domestic violence public awareness campaign in New Zealand (one that would aim to help victims seek appropriate help from their situation).This US community level intervention was called the AIDS Community Demonstration Project (ACDP), its aim being to increase HIV risk reduction behaviours amongst at-risk people within the community. It is acknowledged throughout this thesis that the risk of HIV infection and the nature of domestic violence are very different issues although both are key health issues. However, the analysis of the ACDP was chosen predominantly because of the broad community focussed principles that it followed. The core research question of this thesis is as follows: Are the broad principles used within the ACDP suitable to be integrated into a victim-based domestic violence public awareness campaign in New Zealand? If so, to what extent? If not, why?My critical analysis has been informed by qualitative interviews with key experts in the field of domestic violence prevention in New Zealand. This critical analysis has highlighted a number of key elements in the complex task of domestic violence prevention and discusses the measures needed to sustain an abuse-free New Zealand.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Family violence</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="subject">Social Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealanders making advance directions: a discourse analysis</field><field name="creator">Wareham, Pauline</field><field name="description">Advance directives (ADs) convey consumers' wishes about accepting or refusing future treatment if they become incompetent. The issue of making a particular AD, more commonly referred to as a living will, is the focus of this thesis. The typical direction of the living will is that life-sustaining activities such as the provision of mechanical ventilation should be withheld so that a person may die what is hoped to be a 'peaceful death'. Clearly the whole basis of the thinking behind the recognition of ADs is that patients' wishes should prevail. ADs have been championed by some as a means of preserving both dignity and autonomy at the end of life in the face of increasing medical advances in technology to preserve life indefinitely. ADs are seen as a means of promoting peace of mind in will-makers, of allowing carers and family to honour the person's wishes and of stimulating communication between all involved parties.While at present there is no statutory right for people in New Zealand to make ADs, it is considered they have rights to do so in common law as consumers of health and disability services in this country. Little is known about the views of New Zealanders making ADs or their justification for doing so. This small qualitative study, using a discourse analysis approach after Potter and Wetherell (1987), aimed to investigate how the participants justified making ADs. Six people were interviewed and the transcriptions were analysed identifying three dominant interpretative repertoires and three corresponding subject positions.The findings indicated that the participants positioned themselves: as independent self-determining individuals who knew when they were ready to make ADs after witnessing undesirable deaths of close family members; as judges of knowing when inappropriate treatments lead to undignified deaths; and as concerned parents who want to relieve their families of uncertainty in the future when making surrogate end-of-life decisions for them. Witnessing a prolonged family member's death in the past was a contributing factor to the participants making ADs. The participants' recall of these events led them to make their wishes known in advance so that their families, in turn, would not have to go through a similar experience at the terminal stages of their lives. The overarching motivations for formalising ADs was to avoid having life artificially prolonged by receiving life-sustaining treatments as well as the desire to die a dignified death.This study highlights the need for healthcare professionals to value the importance of advance planning with well adults before they lose the capacity to give informed choices at the end of life. The taking of a values history as part of this advance planning may inform family and healthcare professionals about peoples' general values and at the same time confirm and record end-of-life choices for future reference.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Advance directives (Medical care)</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Commercialising national identity: a critical examination of New Zealand's America's Cup campaigns of 1987, 1992 and 1995</field><field name="creator">Evans, Bryn</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses forms of New Zealand national identity constructed in conjunction with successive America's Cup campaigns in 1987, 1992 and 1995. It is argued that New Zealand national iconography was appropriated by government and corporate interests and utilised as a mechanism for corporate capital accumulation and legitimation.The first New Zealand challenge was set against a background of neo-liberal policy reform initiated by the fourth Labour government in 1984. The comprehensive economic and social policy implementation had multiple negative effects for New Zealand's political economy. This thesis undertakes a comprehensive analysis of these effects and argues that the commitment to neo-liberalism resulted in both the means for a New Zealand America's Cup syndicate and the necessity for an event which could obscure New Zealand's economic decline. National identity was reformulated through America's Cup nationalism to incorporate the values of neo-liberalism.As a result of the entrenchment of neo-liberal values, the needs of corporate interests and state enterprises to define citizens as consumers concluded in the commercialisation of culture. This thesis argues that the pursuit of effective corporate branding strategies led to the appropriation of symbols and images of national identity by corporate interests. The 1992 and 1995 America's Cup challenges represent the convergence of the discourses of sport, media and capitalism under the shared agenda of capital accumulation and legitimation. This convergence was structured around a commercialised conception of national identity which bore little relation to the social and economic reality experienced by many New Zealanders.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">America's Cup races</field><field name="subject">Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Special events</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Auckland</field><field name="subject">Communication studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Menace or moral panic? Methamphetamine and the New Zealand press</field><field name="creator">Wallace, Carla-Louise</field><field name="description">This thesis, presented as a collection of articles, journalistic in its tone, is titled "Menace or Moral Panic? Methamphetamine and the New Zealand Press". Within the collection, evidence and background information is presented that supports a claim that a moral panic fitting Stanley Cohen's classic model occurred between 1999 and 2004.This moral panic was also identified using Stuart Hall's definition of a moral panic outlined in his mugging study published in 1978 as well as the more contemporary model of Goode and Ben-Yehuda (1994). Jock Young's theory of The Deviance Amplification Spiral is also addressed and can be applied to this collection when considering the close 'symbiotic' relationship that our press here in New Zealand have with our police force. In looking at this particular subject it is vital that we look at how drugs and drug use play a role in the media. Also as part of the backgrounding for this collection it was of critical importance to find whether a moral panic happened anywhere else in the world in relation to methamphetamine. Two previous moral panics about methamphetamine are featured in this collection as part of a case study presented in "Ancient Anecdotes meet Modernity: Drugs and the Rise of Methamphetamine" in which between the years of 1989 and 1996 America passed through two moral panics brought on to a considerable extent by a mixture of media hype and political opportunism. By including a foreign case study we can begin to see how the New Zealand methamphetamine situation had similarities to the American example, making identification of New Zealand's moral panic more definitive. Giving verification to the claims, a lengthy analysis of twenty-five samples from the New Zealand press is also featured in this collection. By looking at the way the stories from the samples developed identification of the various stages of the moral panic become more visible. The last article in this collection investigates, using expert interviews, if there is enough evidence to support the claim that methamphetamine may be a menace to New Zealand society, but that the extent of that menace may be exaggerated by a moral panic brought on by our media and fuelled by our police force.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Methamphetamine abuse</field><field name="subject">Drugs and mass media</field><field name="subject">Moral conditions</field><field name="subject">Deviant behavior in mass media</field><field name="subject">Press</field><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/215</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Confronting design: case studies in the design of ceramics in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Christopher</field><field name="description">This study maps a way of looking at design history in New Zealand through the investigation of a taxon of industrially manufactured ceramics. Understanding design as an enfolded process of production, distribution, mediation and consumption, three threshold moments are identified as occurring within the European settlement period: the internationalisation of commodity production and consumption; the emergence of import substitution; and the deregulation of the market. While production has formed an element in the design of ceramics in New Zealand, it is contended that greater significance lies in both the trade and the mediation of these commodities and in particular in the way these have influenced local consumer choice. Emerging from this study, a series of key binaries become apparent: between the metropolitan centre and the frontier; between state and business; and between the traditional and the progressive. Likewise, the positioning of design within the institutionalised sites of power-or its absence from them-has been a prime force both in the development of manufacturing industry and in determining the nature of the consumer market.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ceramics</field><field name="subject">Arts</field><field name="subject">New Zealand design history</field><field name="subject">New Zealand material culture history</field><field name="subject">Crown Lynn Pottery</field><field name="subject">New Zealand international exhibitions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growing through adversity: becoming women who live without partner abuse: a grounded theory study</field><field name="creator">Giles, Janice R</field><field name="description">Abuse of women by male partners is a significant social problem in New Zealand. Ten participating women, whose experiences span more than fifty years, provided interviews focused on their recovery from partner abuse but including the broader context of their lives. Grounded Theory methodology with a feminist perspective was applied in conjunction with Grounded Theory methods. The study identifies GROWING THROUGH ADVERSITY as the basic psychosocial process of recovery from an abusive relationship. GROWING THROUGH ADVERSITY has three inter-related core categories: FINDING A PATH BEYOND ABUSE concerns experiencing abuse and finding safety; GETTING A LIFE is about interactions with the social world; and BECOMING MYSELF involves personal growth and development. In the first of five phases, FALLING FOR LOVE, women commit to the relationship with unexamined, traditional beliefs in gender ideals. When the partner becomes abusive stereotyped meanings of relationship require compliance as the price of 'love', or result in shame and self-blame. In phase two, TAKING CONTROL, coping strategies of resistance and compliance fail. Seeking help for themselves, or the relationship, results in finding other perspectives and new contexts of meaning, prompting participants to overcome personal, social, and safety constraints to separation. Phase three includes the distress and difficulty of SECURING A BASE. In the fourth phase, MAKING SENSE OF IT, participants seek both explanation and meaning for their experience. By the fifth phase, BEING MYSELF, participants have constructed new meaning systems and integrated into wider social contexts. They have become women who live by their own values, without partner abuse. Analysis of participants' experience highlights the changing purpose of help-seeking, The paradox of shame and self blame, and processes of meaning-making and coping are clarified. Victim-blaming is identified as a social sanction that supports abuse. Personal growth processes are conceptualised by integrating several developmental theorists.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wife abuse</field><field name="subject">Abused wives</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing students' approaches to learning: a case study of postgraduate students at a New Zealand university</field><field name="creator">Jiao, Xiaomin</field><field name="description">Research on students' approaches to learning in higher education has consistently demonstrated a range of factors influencing students' approaches to learning. The vast majority of these studies have been carried out with British and Australian undergraduate students, primarily first year students. These studies focused on specific factors using models of inventories or questionnaires.As a postgraduate student, my interest in tertiary education and my working background as a staff member in a Chinese university has led me to the present research. From my point of view, knowledge is constructed rather than transmitted. Students have their own characteristics in the process of constructing their own knowledge due to their diverse educational and life experiences. Thus, it is not appropriate to categorise them in certain fixed stereotypes. For understanding their learning experiences and exploring the factors which influence their approaches to learning, it is necessary to have interactions with them in order to gain in-depth insights.This researcher used interviews on the basis of an investigation of the factors influencing learning from a sample of postgraduate students in a New Zealand university. The interview data was discussed with participants, other postgraduate students as well as some lecturers within the school. Common themes across participants were identified. In addition, the factors within each participant's interviews were presented to show the unique characteristics of the individual postgraduate students.The findings from this study showed that the influence of students' prior knowledge and learning orientations was important and this supports the literature in this field. The contextual factors which include lecturers, choice and integration of courses, and assessments were found to affect students' approaches to learning and responsible for the variability of learning orientations. Consistent with other studies, work responsibilities, financial problems and family commitments were found to have an impact on approaches. Lecturers' preferred teaching and research styles and students' expectations of lecturers' support were found to be significant factors with regard to students' approaches to learning.This study explored the factors that influence postgraduate students' approaches to learning, especially at the individual level. The findings have significance for understanding students' learning and improving the quality of learning. Lecturers might be aware of the diversity of students' characteristics and adopt appropriate teaching strategies for enhancing students learning. The school administrators and programme leaders might want to create a more positive environment for lecturers' better teaching practices. Postgraduate students in the similar situations may confirm the factors that influence their learning approaches and assume higher personal academic responsibilities for their learning.In my future study, the lecturers teaching conceptions and factors that influence their teaching approaches will be investigated for mutual understanding between lecturers and students. Alternatively, further study might replicate the present research with a sample of postgraduate student in my home country (China) to identify the similarities and differences.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Graduate students</field><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Caregiving for children who have had a traumatic brain injury: structuring for security</field><field name="creator">Jones, Margaret A</field><field name="description">This New Zealand study used a grounded theory methodology to explore the day-to-day occupations of family caregiving for children who had sustained a traumatic brain injury. Semi-structured interviews and participant observations were employed to gather data from five families including children of pre-school and school age and their parents. Constant comparative analysis of the data revealed a central caregiving category, Structuring For Security, which encompassed two simultaneous and interdependent caregiving processes. A model is presented illustrating the processes.Structuring For Security describes the way the parents' caregiving is directed towards building a framework that provides for the present and future safety and success of their children. Holding Things Together explains endeavours to contain the distressing events resulting from the accident, with a focus on protecting the children from physical and emotional dangers. Joining My Child With Others explains what is happening when parents set things up for their children to spend time in activity with other people. The two processes are mediated by support from others, and involve learning and use of practical knowledge about the child. Successful implementation of the processes results in parents' increasing awareness of their ability to cope, progress in the children, and children's successful participation with other people. Participation in the processes is ongoing, responding to change in the child and in the environment.The study findings suggest a basis for the development of a framework that families and clinicians might use to guide caregiving for children after a traumatic brain injury. The findings also indicate the importance of supporting parents in developing effective caregiving structures that fit with their concerns for their children's safety and success with others. Consideration needs to be given to policies that take into account the safety issues involved for children and the support needs of parents following the accident.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brain</field><field name="subject">Wounds and injuries</field><field name="subject">Brain-damaged children</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Brain damage</field><field name="subject">Patients</field><field name="subject">Home care</field><field name="subject">Brain Injuries</field><field name="subject">Child</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Walking the line: managing type 2 diabetes: a grounded theory study of part-Europeans from Fiji</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Sandra</field><field name="description">This study examines the experience of managing Type 2 diabetes from the perspective of Part-European people from Fiji who have this disorder. A qualitative approach was used, and the methodology was grounded theory based on the theoretical perspective of symbolic interactionism. Data was collected from the in-depth interviews of nine participants who have been living with Type 2 diabetes. Text from the interview transcripts was analysed using the version of grounded theory advocated by Strauss and Corbin (1998). This process facilitated the discovery of 'Carrying On With Life And Living' as the main concern shared by Part-Europeans managing Type 2 diabetes. It also identified the substantive theory of 'Walking The Line' as the core category and the basic social and psychological process by which Part-Europeans resolve their main concern of 'Carrying On With Life And Living'. This was a three-stage process involving firstly 'Carrying on Regardless', secondly 'Attempting Balance in Time and Motion and Control', and thirdly 'Balancing, Unbalancing, and Recovering Balance'. The results of this study reveal that the social and historical contexts of Part-European culture, such as heavy drinking, carrying on with life and living in the face of adversity, and taking traditional medicine impact significantly throughout their managing process. Findings of this study may contribute to development of some culturally aware strategies that could assist healthcare services to provide appropriate support, intervention, and education for Part-Europeans with Type 2 diabetes. This study also addresses the lack of studies concerned with the management of Type 2 diabetes in Pacific peoples and serves to inform research initiatives and priorities set by the Health Research Council of New Zealand.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alcohol</field><field name="subject">Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="subject">Pacific Islands</field><field name="subject">Social life and customs</field><field name="subject">Fiji</field><field name="subject">Traditional medicine</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/295</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational learning: managing environmental complexity and change</field><field name="creator">White, Natalie C</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an investigative analysis of organisational learning and addresses two key gaps evident within the literature: 1. Diversity of thought over what constitutes organisational learning 2. Lack of empirical study that authenticates the 'practice' of organisational learning In examining these two gaps this thesis provides a synthesis of the fragmented literature, resulting in the development of five core tenets that together constitute organisational learning. Until now, this type of synthesis has never been undertaken. The core tenets are then tested to address the question of whether organisational learning is practiced. This involved a Content Analysis of reports made by Senior Management in leading New Zealand organisations. A pragmatic approach was used in analysing this data, allowing for both quantitative and qualitative methods. The chief finding of this study is that four of the five tenets of organisational learning are prevalent, to varying degrees, among the New Zealand organisations studied.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organizational learning</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The swerve: the Elliot Collins handbook</field><field name="creator">Collins, Elliot</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Place holders</field><field name="subject">Punctuation</field><field name="subject">Visual brainstorms</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/382</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of global intellectual property instruments into trade related intellectual property rights (TRIPS) and its ineffective enforcement in developing world: a case study</field><field name="creator">Nasir, Saeed</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to critically evaluate global intellectual property   instruments with detailed analysis of the Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Aspects of Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement) provisions in order to investigate the enforcement issues, confronted by the Developing Countries due to fragile legal infrastructure. These intellectual property laws are evolutionary and designed to protect and honour human intellectual creations since BC 400 which recognized them distinct from divine inspirations. Italian Renaissance witnessed the systematic recognition of human skill, craft, innovation and invention. Venetian Government institutionalized it by awarding patents and copyrights to skilled workers and publishers. Its primary purpose was to protect the trade and secondary was to foster intellectual creativity through reward and recognition. These rewards and recognitions, known as Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs), developed with each new invention and creation. Industrial Revolution accelerated it and developed nations entered into international conventions to protect their nationals and their interests across the borders. In 1995, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement) accommodated all the previous (IPRs) instruments and its enforcement linked with global trade. It was a dilemma for developing nations who were desirous to participate in global trading system for their economic development but could not administer (IPRs) regimes on their land due to fragile and static infrastructure. All assistance from developed countries during the transitional period could not address the problems due to alien prescriptions, applied to counter problems in the developed World. Developing Nations need innovative, flexible and indigenous approach to administer the TRIPS Agreement. A case study of Pakistan judicial environment to address the TRIPS enforcement issue has been conducted. The methodological approach of this thesis is the interpretive paradigm of the qualitative research tradition. This interpretive paradigm or framework is applied through the two methodologies of hermeneutics and case study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Legal hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">IP rights</field><field name="subject">Developing countries</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/673</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinants of inter-partner learning in an alliance between a national sporting organisation and a professional sport franchise</field><field name="creator">Cleary, Paul</field><field name="description">This research explores the determinants of inter-partner learning in alliances. The potential for organisations to learn from their alliance partner is well recognised in the literature. The Knowledge Based View of the Firm (KBV) posits that an organisation&#8217;s knowledge base, especially its tacit knowledge base, is a source of sustainable competitive advantage. Three key determinants of inter-partner learning are: intent to learn, transparency (i.e. willingness to share knowledge) and receptivity (i.e. capacity to learn). These three concepts are used to guide a single case study of an alliance between a National Sport Organisation (NSO) and a Professional Sport Franchise (PSF). Data was obtained through semi-structured interviews with key informants at both organisations. Each individual transcript was colour coded in relation to each of the four research questions. All relevant quotes were then copied into separate files for each organisation and categorised by research question. The results of the study suggest that 1) despite historical conflict, the relationship between alliance partners is becoming increasingly positive; 2) intent to learn was low in both organisations but higher in the NSO; 3) the NSO was more transparent than the PSF; and 4) receptivity was low for both organisations. Key conclusions of the research are that the NSO and PSF are failing to take full advantage of the opportunities presented by their relationship, but intent, transparency and receptivity remain useful concepts to explore inter-partner learning.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sport management</field><field name="subject">Alliances</field><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="subject">Knowledge</field><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understorey management for the enhancement of populations of a leafroller (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) parasitoid (Dolichogenidea tasmanica (Cameron)) in Canterbury, New Zealand apple orchards</field><field name="creator">Irvin, N. A.</field><field name="description">This study investigated understorey management in Canterbury, New Zealand, apple orchards for the enhancement of populations of Dolichogenidea tasmanica (Cameron) (Braconidae) for leafroller (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) biological control. The first objective was to determine the influence of understorey plants on the abundance of D. tasmanica and leafroller parasitism, and to investigate the mechanisms behind this influence. The second was to determine the most suitable understorey plants in terms of their ability to enhance parasitoid abundance, leafroller parasitism, parasitoid longevity, parasitoid fecundity and its ability to not benefit leafroller. Results from three consecutive field trials showed that buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench), coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.), alyssum (Lobularia maritima (L.) Desv), and, to a lesser extent, broad bean (Vicia faba L.), enhanced parasitoid abundance and leafroller parasitism. The mechanisms behind the effects of understorey plants had previously been unexplored. However, results here showed that it was the flowers or the buckwheat that 'attracted' the parasitoid to the plant and not the shelter, aphids or microclimate that the plant may also provide. Providing flowering plants in the orchard understorey also increased immigration of parasitoids and enhanced parasitoids and enhanced parasitoid longevity and fecundity in the laboratory. In contrast, the understorey plants had no influence on the female:male ratio of D. tasmanica.  Although coriander enhanced leafroller parasitism three-fold in field experiments compared with controls, it failed to enhance the longevity of both sexes of D. tasmanica in the laboratory compared with water-only. Broad bean significantly enhanced parasitoid abundance three-fold and significantly increased parasitism from 0% to 75% compared with the controls on one leafroller release date. However, laboratory trials showed that of male D. tasmancia but it did not enhance female longevity. Also, female D. tasmanica foraging on broad bean produced a total of only three parasitoid cocoons, but this result was based on an overall 6.5% survival of larvae to pupae or to parasitoid cocoon. Furthermore, results suggested that extrafloral nectar secretion decreased as the plants matured. Phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth.) did not significantly enhance parasitism rate in the field compared with controls, and numbers of D. tasmanica captured by suction sampling were significantly lower in phacelia treatments compared with alyssum, buckwheat and control plots. Also, laboratory experiments showed that survival of D. tasmanica on phacelia flowers was equivalent to that on water-only and significantly lower than on buckwheat. These results suggest that phacelia does not provide nectar to D. tasmanica, only pollen, and therefore is not a suitable understorey plant for D. tasmanica enhancement in orchards. Buckwheat and alyssum showed the most potential as understorey plants for the enhancement of natural enemies. Buckwheat not only increased numbers of D. tasmanica seven-fold, but also increased numbers of beneficial lacewings (Micromus tasmaniae (Walker)) and hover flies (Syrphidae) captured on yellow sticky traps compared with the controls. It significantly increased leafroller parasitism by D. tasmanica from 0% to 86% compared with the controls (on one date only), and in the laboratory enhanced D. tasmanica longevity and increased fecundity compared with water-only. Similarly, alyssum significantly increased parasitism rate compared with controls, and two-fold more D. tasmanica were suction sampled in these plots compared with controls. It also enhanced longevity of both sexes of D. tasmanica compared with water, and showed the most favourable characteristics in terms of being of no benefit to leafrollers. This is because it was not preferred over apple by leafroller larvae and when they were forced to feed on it, it caused high mortality (94.3%) and low pupal weight (15 mg). Furthermore, alyssum did not enhance the number of fertile eggs produced by adult leafrollers compared with water only. However, further research is required to address the overall effect of buckwheat and alyssum on crop production and orchard management, including effects on fruit yield and quality, frost risk, disease incidence, soil quality, weeds and other pests. Also, research into the ability of these plants to survive in the orchard with little maintenance, and into the optimal sowing rates, would be useful. Sampling natural populations of leafroller within each treatment showed that damage from leafrollers and the number of leafroller larvae were respectively 20.3% and 29.3% lower in the flowering treatments compared with the controls. Furthermore, field trials showed up to a six-fold increase in leafroller pupae in controls compared with buckwheat and alyssum. This suggests that increasing leafroller parasitism rate from understorey management in orchards will translate into lower pest populations, although neither larval numbers/damage nor pupal numbers differed significantly between treatments. Trapping D. tasmanica at a gradient of distances showed that this parasitoid travels into rows adjacent to buckwheat plots, indicating that growers may be able to sow flowering plants in every second or third row of the orchard, and still enhance leafroller biocontrol while minimising the adverse effects of a cover crop. Sowing buckwheat and alyssum in orchard understoreys may enhance biological control of apple pests in organic apple production and reduce the number of insect growth regulators applied in IFP programmes. However, the challenge still remains to investigate whether conservation biological control can reduce leafroller populations below economic thresholds.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">leafroller</field><field name="subject">Tortricidae</field><field name="subject">parasitoid</field><field name="subject">Dolichogenidea tasmanica</field><field name="subject">understorey management</field><field name="subject">apple orchard</field><field name="subject">enhancement</field><field name="subject">Phacelia tanacetifolia</field><field name="subject">Fagopyrum esculentum</field><field name="subject">Coriandrum sativum</field><field name="subject">Lobularia maritima</field><field name="subject">Vicia faba L.</field><field name="subject">conservation biological control</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270703 Terrestrial ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300303 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Barriers to school inclusion : an investigation into the exclusion of disabled students from and within New Zealand schools : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kearney, Alison</field><field name="description">Research evidence suggests that disabled students are experiencing forms of exclusion from and within schools, however little is known of the nature of this phenomenon. This study investigated the nature of school exclusion in relation to disabled students. It sought to uncover the factors that exclude disabled students from and within schools, and make recommendations to reduce and eliminate these factors. Using a grounded theory methodology, this research investigated the nature of school exclusion. It explored parents of disabled student&#8217;s views about their children&#8217;s experiences of school exclusion both from school, and within school. The themes identified by parents were then further investigated with school principals, teachers, teacher aides and school students. This study revealed that disabled students are being excluded from and within school in New Zealand in a number of ways. These include being denied enrolment and/or fulltime attendance at school; being denied access to, and participation within the curriculum; being bullied; inappropriate teacher and/or principal beliefs and practices in relation to funding; a lack of caring, valuing and responsibility by school staff; limited teacher knowledge and understanding; poor relationships between parents and school staff; and exclusionary beliefs and practices in relation to teacher aides. Based on the findings of the study, four propositions were put forward to explain why disabled students are being excluded from and within school. These are that disabled students are considered to be less entitled to human rights than non-disabled students; that there is a lack of school accountability in relation to legal and human rights obligations to disabled students; that inclusive education is predicated on issues of funding and resourcing; and that there is prejudice towards disabled students. Based on the findings of how and why disabled students are excluded from and within school, prompts for classroom teachers and school principals/senior management staff were developed in seven areas shown to be important to this phenomenon. These areas are access, accountability, attitudes, knowledge, responsibility, and funding and resourcing. The prompts are intended to help guide attention and discussion to the issues that are important if exclusion is to be reduced and eliminated. As well as this, recommendations are made for government and government agencies outlining ways that they can contribute to the reduction and elimination of school exclusion for disabled students.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">students with disabilities</field><field name="subject">disabled students</field><field name="subject">marginalisation</field><field name="subject">exclusion</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">inclusive education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330108 Special education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/876</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feeding ecology of the New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor Philosophy in Zoology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Meynier, Laureline</field><field name="description">The New Zealand (NZ) sea lion Phocarctos hookeri is the only pinniped endemic to NZ with a population of approximately 12,000 individuals. Its breeding range is currently restricted to NZ sub-Antarctic islands, and it has failed to recolonise its pristine distribution around the NZ main islands despite its protection since 1881. The current hypothesis is that the population growth of this pinniped is limited by the distribution of suitable prey on the Auckland Islands (50&#176;30'S, 166&#176;E) shelf, and by the direct and indirect pressure exerted by the arrow squid Nototodarus sloani fishery. However, this hypothesis has not been fully tested to date as there has been limited information on the diet of the NZ sea lion and their potential prey. The objective of this thesis is to analyse the diet of NZ sea lions over several years with particular emphasis on the most reproductively important segment of the population: lactating females. This thesis provides the first quantification by percentage mass of the diet of NZ sea lion using a combination of stomach content analysis, qualitative fatty acid (FA) analysis, and quantitative FA signature analysis (QFASA). Stomach contents and blubber FAs were analysed from 121 individuals incidentally caught (by-caught) in the southern arrow squid fishery from the years 1997 to 2006. The blubber FAs of 78 freeranging lactating females captured at Enderby Island, Auckland Islands, were also examined during January and February of 2000 to 2005. Data obtained from both stomach analysis and QFASA indicate that arrow squid, rattails Macrouridae, hoki Macruronus novaezelandiae and red cod Pseudophycis bachus are key prey species for NZ sea lions in the Auckland Islands region. Because these prey species live mostly at depths greater than 200 m, lactating females must undertake long foraging trips and dive regularly to greater depths than other sea lion species. Data from QFASA indicates that this foraging pattern is conducted over an extended period through the summer and autumn. The daily food requirement of a lactating female was estimated by a simple energetic model to be greater than 20% of its body mass. During years of low arrow squid recruitment such as 1999 and 2001, the amounts of squid required by the NZ sea lion population may have been similar to the amount harvested by the fishery, suggesting that resource competition is likely to occur between the arrow squid fishery and NZ sea lions in years of low squid abundance. Half of the fishing activity of the southern squid fishery occurs in the north of the Auckland Islands shelf where NZ sea lions forage, leading to incidental captures every year. This research emphasises that management of the NZ sea lion must not only consider the direct interactions with the arrow squid fishery, but also the likelihood of food resource competition between the fishery and NZ sea lions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">arrow squid</field><field name="subject">red cod</field><field name="subject">Auckland Islands</field><field name="subject">fishing activity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Key success drivers in offshore software development : New Zealand and Indian vendors' perspectives : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Technology at Massey University, Albany campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mathrani, Anuradha</field><field name="description">Offshore software development (OSD) is a leading business sector in the present &#8216;glocal&#8217; IT marketplace, and vendors in different countries are opening software development centres worldwide to take advantage of the new business opportunities. However, software development is both a technical and a social process as various software modules need to be integrated, which requires ongoing interaction between the stakeholders. The software modules rely upon local knowledge regarding customer wants, project specific features, chosen design methodologies by development team members and synchronisation of activities to confirm the next design iteration. This study focuses on knowledge sharing processes involving the interplay between acquiring local knowledge and applying the knowledge acquired into the design of the client-specific software builds. New knowledge is created as new processes are applied and new outcomes realised, resulting in re-definition of software development practices. Building on existing theories with empirical case study evidence, this research reveals the socio-technical influences on knowledge management in the OSD process. Ideographic research methods have been applied to bring sensitivity in the everyday organisational activities for knowledge sharing across diverse social and cultural groups within two country contexts (New Zealand and India). Empirical data from ten case studies is used to inductively develop a conceptual framework, which has been applied to make within case and cross case comparisons across three levels of analysis (micro, meso and macro) for knowledge sharing. The micro level analysis explores individual key success drivers (behaviours and methodologies), the meso level explores organisational level practices (work processes and structures) and the macro level gives a holistic evaluation across two country contexts. Country contexts reveal that New Zealand vendors share closer cultural proximity with their clients, are engaged in client facing skills and have further outsourced software development tasks to other low cost countries. The Indian vendors are involved in software construction, prefer technical specialist skills and have defined more discipline in their software development processes. The thesis offers new insights on how vendors&#8217; shape their software development styles based upon their beliefs and understanding of the offshore market and is especially relevant to both vendors and clients who intend venturing into the offshore market.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">software localisation</field><field name="subject">knowledge sharing</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How can midlife nurses be supported to deliver bedside care in the acute clinical services until retirement? : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the degree of Master of Philosophy (Nursing), Massey University, Turitea, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dodsworth, Caroline</field><field name="description">As the baby boomer generation move inexorably towards retirement and the requirement for health care services increases, the supply of nurses available to provide care at the patient bedside is forecast to fall significantly short of demand.

These nurses have provided insights which offer employers of valuable senior nurses, suggestions for maximising their potential. Through the use of questionnaires and focus groups nurses aged 45 years and over were asked what the employer can do to ensure that they are able to continue to work at the patient bedside until they reach the age of retirement. The results of this research demonstrate a workforce of nurses who are passionate and committed to their profession, but feeling disillusioned and disempowered. The nursing environment has changed over the span of their career and they find the increased workload, together with increasing professional demands, too hard to cope with. They feel they have no control over their workload, their shift patterns, or the expectations of their patients and colleagues. They want their experience to be recognized but they do not want to have to prove competency; they want to have a voice but they are unwilling to pursue postgraduate education to learn how to become visible and emancipated.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">baby boomers</field><field name="subject">professional demands</field><field name="subject">age and employment</field><field name="subject">nursing practice</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing intrusive noise and low amplitude sound : a thesis submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Health Science, Massey University, Wellington Campus, Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health</field><field name="creator">Thorne, Robert</field><field name="description">Annoyance due to relatively high levels of sound and noise, above 50 dB, has been well documented in noise assessment literature.

Shahadat, School of Sociology &amp; Anthropology, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores urban poverty and the adaptations of the urban poor in the slums of the megacity of Dhaka, Bangladesh. It seeks to make a contribution to understanding and analysis of the phenomenon of rapid mass urbanisation in the Third World and its social consequences, the formation of huge urban slums and new forms of urban poverty. Its focus is the analysis of poverty which has been overwhelmingly dominated by economic approaches to the neglect of the social questions arising from poverty. This thesis approaches these social questions through an ???urban livelihood framework???, arguing that this provides a more comprehensive framework to conceptualise poverty through its inclusion of both material and non-material dimensions. The study is based on primary data collected from slums in Dhaka City. Five hundred poor households were surveyed using a structured questionnaire to investigate the economic activities, expenditure and consumption, access to housing and land, family and social networking and cultural and political integration. The survey data was supplemented by qualitative data collected through fifteen in-depth interviews with poor households. The thesis found that poverty in the slums of Dhaka City was most strongly influenced by recent migration from rural areas, household organisation, participation in the ???informal??? sector of the economy and access to housing and land. Almost half of the poor households in the study locations were identified as ???hardcore poor???, that is having insufficient income for their physical needs. The remainder were found to be ???absolute poor???, those who experienced poverty and vulnerability but varied in their levels of income and consumption. This level of poverty was also characterised by their social, cultural and political marginalisation. In summary, the urban poor remain very much dependent on their household and social networking, the main social capital they use to adapt to life in Dhaka City. Overall, the urban poor in this study experience the highest level of poverty and vulnerability in their everyday life. The thesis argues that the experience of poverty in the megacity of Dhaka for these households follows the pattern of urbanisation without development, the very opposite to their expectations and aspirations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Poor - Bangladesh - Dhaka</field><field name="subject">Poverty - Bangladesh - Dhaka</field><field name="subject">Poverty - Developing countries</field><field name="subject">Dhaka (Bangladesh) - Social conditions</field><field name="subject">Dhaka (Bangladesh) - Surveys</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parameterisation of atmosphere-ocean surface interactions, with applications to the Australian monsoon</field><field name="creator">Zhuang, Haixiong, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">Atmosphere-ocean and atmosphere-land interactions are important processes which determine the development of monsoon systems. In this study, a new atmosphere-ocean surface interaction scheme, referred to as AOSIS, is developed and verified with observed data. AOSIS, together with ALSIS (Atmosphere-Land Surface Interaction Scheme), is then coupled into CEMSYS4 (Computational Environmental Modelling System) to investigate the influences of atmosphere-ocean and atmosphere-land surface interactions on the Australian Monsoon, especially the monsoon onset, break and withdrawal. Numerical experiments are carried out and the simulations are compared with the NCEP (National Center for Environmental Prediction, America) data.  AOSIS is constructed with three basic components, i.e., a two-layer ocean temperature model, a wind-wave model and a surface flux model. We divide the ocean into a mixed layer and a deep layer. However, the depth of the mixed layer is not constant but varies with time, depending on surface wind shear and buoyancy flux. In AOSIS, we adapted the approach of relating the stages of wave development by wave age and proposed a new expression for calculating the ocean surface roughness length, $z_{0m}$, with consideration of waves.  We test AOSIS in a stand along mode against the Moana data and the NCEP  data. The comparison with the Moana data shows that AOSIS has considerable skill in simulating SST (sea surface temperature) and energy fluxes, with the simulated values in good agreement with observed data. AOSIS is also successful in simulating the warm and cool effects considered in the COARE (Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment) scheme. Comparison with the NCEP data also confirms that AOSIS simulates SST well.  AOSIS and ALSIS are then coupled into CEMSYS4. We apply the system to the simulation of SST and surface energy fluxes over the Australian region and compared the results with the NCEP data. It is found that the simulated SST and energy fluxes are in good agreement with the NCEP data. Further, we study the synoptic events of the Australian Monsoon onset, break and withdrawal and examine the impacts of atmosphere-ocean and atmosphere-land surface interactions on such synoptic events.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ocean-atmosphere interaction; Monsoons -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The generation of monoclonal antibodies to  investigate perlecan turnover in cells and  tissues</field><field name="creator">Ma, Jin, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Perlecan is an important basement membrane heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan that is essential for various cell signaling events involved in tissue development. Heparanase is a lysosomal enzyme involved in the turnover of HS. This project aimed to assist in researching the structure of HS on perlecan and how this structure changes with tissue development. This will be achieved by generating monoclonal antibodies that have an altered affinity for perlecan after heparanase treatment.  Recombinant perlecan domain I was characterized by ELISA and western blotting and used as the antigen for two fusions. The first fusion was focused on the production of IgM the common subtype of anti-glycosaminoglycans antibodies. However, no clones were produced, which may have been due to the lack of feeder layers. In order to address this problem, the fibroblast cell line MRC-5 was used as a feeder layer in the second fusion. From this fusion, we obtained 216 positive cultures, which were screened against full length perlecan from endothelial cells. Of these, 26 cultures were tested against heparanase treated perlecan, and then 2 cultures were chosen for subcloning based on the different immunoreactivity between enzyme treated and nontreated perlecan. From the 2 chosen cultures, 13 sub clones were derived and 10 of them were adapted into a serum free culture environment. The 10 monoclonal antibodies displayed strong immunoreactivity with full length perlecan in ELISA and Western Blotting. When they were used as primary antibodies in Immunocytochemistry, they were able to recognize the native perlecan deposited by human chondrocytes. When the cells were incubated with heparanase, antibody 5D7-2E4 and 13E9-3G5 showed an increase in immunoreactivity while antibody 13E9-3B3 gave a decrease. These three antibodies will be the potential tools used in the future to study perlecan turnover in different cells and tissue. The remaining seven antibodies will also be very useful in the research of perlecan as they have been shown to bind to the protein core. In the future, it will be worth subcloning some of the frozen stored stocks of uncloned hybridomas, where there are potential opportunities to select antibodies, which will react with the carbohydrate chains on perlecan.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heparanase.</field><field name="subject">Perlecan.</field><field name="subject">Heparan sulfate proteoglycan</field><field name="subject">Monoclonal antibody.</field><field name="subject">Basement membrane.</field><field name="subject">Monoclonal antibodies.</field><field name="subject">Hybridomas.</field><field name="subject">Cells.</field><field name="subject">Tissues.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conceptions of generic graduate attributes : a phenomenographic investigation of academics' understanding of generic graduate attributes in the context of contemporary university courses and teaching.</field><field name="creator">Barrie, Simon Christopher</field><field name="description">Thesis (Ph.D.) University of Technology, Sydney.

A criticism of some past research into IS/business alignment is that it has ignored organisational complexity and context. This is partly due to the dominant paradigm in use within IS research. One result of this paradigm is that there are numerous prescriptions provided in the literature for improving alignment but little in the way of theory development that explains the behaviour of practitioners when confronted with the task of attaining alignment. To address these criticisms a grounded theory approach was adopted using a coding family that encouraged the discovery of systems of interaction between variables rather than assuming linear causality. Data was collected via three unstructured focus groups that limited the effect of prior reading of the literature, an important consideration when conducting a grounded theory study. These were followed by semi-structured individual interviews. The instruments for the latter were developed after the focus group interviews were analysed, so reducing the impact of a prior reading. Analysis of the focus group interviews found that the major concern of practitioners was aligning IS strategies to either business strategies documented in business plans or the business strategies in use. This is a similar result to earlier alignment research. As a result of analysis of the focus group interviews the research question stabilised. This research investigated how factors within an organisational setting impact the ability of senior IT managers to identify, then act upon, the business strategies in use. It confirmed many of the enablers and inhibitors to alignment identified in earlier research. However, it also identified two variables that are rarely given prominence in the literature: the mental models held by managers; and the motivation and measurement schemes applied to managers. It is believed that both these variables have a significant impact on the alignment of IS and business strategies. The theory developed here demonstrates that a system of variables will tend to encourage IT managers to either collaborate with their business peers, or retreat from the business and concentrate on providing a low cost reliable technical IT solution. In the former situation alignment of IT managers&#8217; actions to those of their business peers is encouraged. In the latter situation there will be little alignment between business and IS strategies nor between the actions of business and IT managers. A feedback loop of actions by actors within the system tends to reinforce the situation making a change in response extremely problematic. This, then, helps explain the intractable nature of alignment that has been observed for many years.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information technology.</field><field name="subject">Management information systems.</field><field name="subject">Grounded theory.</field><field name="subject">Information systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Good, upright young citizens"?

However, while various theorists show that deliberation is applied to democratic effect in an assortment of arrangements (such as interpersonal relationships, new social movements and international negotiations), there appears to be a hesitation in theorising the means to improve the deliberative functioning of currently existing representative institutions. This thesis argues that despite the many limitations of representative democracy, and of the mass media which act as its key deliberative forum, currently existing models of representative democracy still offer formal and practical opportunities for collective deliberation in rhetorical exchanges among citizens, particularly, but by no means exclusively, in the course of the election campaign. Consideration of recent democratic theory suggests that the quantity and quality of democratic deliberation in a range of particular situations may be assessed against a set of criteria: access, transparency, feedback and coordination. For citizens to make use of the deliberative opportunities raised by the election campaign requires, it is argued, the creation of a contemporary rhetoric. This thesis addresses that process by reviewing the roots of rhetorical practice and theory in tribal and bardic methods used to produce social cohesion, in the activities of the Sophists in Greek, and particularly Athenian, direct democracy and in the practical reason of Aristotle's seminal text. This thesis then proceeds to consider the rhetorical techniques, employed in two recent election campaigns, which overcame the preconceptions of academic and media commentators to produce "upset" results by successfully engaging, it is argued, the citizen-audience in a meta-narrative of rhetorical exchange. From consideration of these three case studies, an account of a rhetoric emerges as a technical and instrumental discipline. While a contemporary version of political rhetoric may be derived from campaign practices in the electoral context, that rhetoric is also capable of utilising the mass media for much broader deliberative purposes and the potential for marginal and critical political forces to apply these activities more widely is explored. Central to the development of new, deliberative accounts of rhetoric is a return to Aristotle to appreciate the ethical import of rhetoric. A contemporary approach to rhetoric, arising from an emerging account of citizenship as participatory, deliberative, global and "media-active" is considered.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Political campaigns.</field><field name="subject">Voting.</field><field name="subject">Democracy.</field><field name="subject">Representative government and representation.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moving and making strange: a design methodology for movement-based interactive technologies.</field><field name="creator">Loke, Lian</field><field name="description">This thesis develops and presents a design methodology that enables designers to work with the moving body in the design and evaluation of interactive, immersive environments built on motion-sensing technologies. The notion of making strange, that underpins the methodology, calls for designers to re-examine and revitalise their assumptions and conceptions of the moving body through bodily-based movement inquiries. This thesis addresses research questions about ways of understanding human movement, of describing and representing human movement and of accessing the felt experience of the moving body in the emerging field of movement-based interaction design. The research questions were explored through a series of three distinct, yet related, projects, each one focusing on different aspects of designing for moving bodies in interactive, immersive environments. The first project analysed an existing interactive product, Sony Playstation2c  EyetoyTM, as a prototype of future movement-based interactive, immersive environments. The second project involved the design and development of a specific interactive, immersive artwork, Bystander. The third project worked with trained dancers and physical performers in a constructed design situation. The contributions of this research are first and foremost the design methodology of Moving and Making Strange: a design approach to movement-based interaction that prioritises the lived experience of movement by both designers and users and values the creative potential of the experiential, moving body. It consists of methods and tools for exploring, experiencing, describing, representing and generating movement that enable designers to shift between the multiple perspectives of the mover, the observer and the machine. It makes particular contributions as follows: &#8226; Laban movement analysis and Labanotation as a design tool. &#8226; Moving-Sensing schema: Suchman&#8217;s analytic framework adapted as a design tool. &#8226; Extension of existing human-centred design tools to explicitly represent moving bodies, in the form of movement-oriented personas and movementoriented scenarios. &#8226; Patterns of watching: a catalogue of audience behaviour in terms of movements and stillness in relation to engagement with a specific interactive, immersive artwork. &#8226; New methods for generating, enacting and experiencing movement, sourced from dance and movement improvisation practices.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human-computer interaction.</field><field name="subject">Interactive computer systems.</field><field name="subject">Motion-sensing technologies.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bayesian methods for modelling and management of trust in wireless sensor networks.</field><field name="creator">Momani, Mohammad</field><field name="description">Security and trust are two interdependent concepts and are often used interchangeably when defining a secure wireless sensor network (WSN) system. However, security is different from trust in that, it assumes no node is trustworthy and requires ongoing authentication using sophisticated protocols leading to high communication and computation overheads. This makes the traditional cryptographic security tools hard, if not impossible, to be used in wireless sensor networks that are severely resource constrained. Trust on the other hand is the exact opposite of security in that any node can interact with any other and requires no authentication and unwrapping of hidden keys to carry on with their business and hence carries zero overhead. However, this leads to the miss-use and abuse of networks causing loss and damage to the owners of the networks. This thesis focuses on developing novel methods for modelling and managing trust that enable WSN to be secure while significantly reducing computing and communication overheads. Although researchers have been studying the problem of trust modelling and management in wireless sensor networks for over a decade, their focus was on the trust associated with routing messages between nodes (communication trust). However, wireless sensor networks are mainly deployed to sense the world and report data, both continuous and discrete. However, there are no methods in the literature that focus on the trust associated with misreporting data (data trust). In this thesis, we model the trust associated with the integrity of the data, and propose methods to combine the data trust with the communication trust to infer the total trust. Bayesian probabilistic approach is used to model and manage trust. A new risk assessment algorithm for establishing trust in wireless sensor networks based on the quality of services characteristics of sensor nodes, using the traditional weighting approach is introduced. Then a Beta distribution is used to model communication trust (due to its binary nature) and determine the weights in terms of the Beta distribution parameters to probabilistically combine direct and indirect trust. The thesis extends the Bayesian probabilistic approach to model data trust for cases when the sensed data is continuous. It introduces the Gaussian trust and reputation system to that accounts for uncertain characteristics of sensor data. Finally we introduce a Bayesian fusion algorithm to combine the data trust and communication trust to infer the overall trust between nodes. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate how the models accurately classify different nodes as being trustworthy or not based on their reliability in sensor reporting and routing functions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless sensor networks.</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/838</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading in the margins : EAP reading pedagogies and their critical, postcritical potential.</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Kate</field><field name="description">International students for whom English is an additional language (EAL) commonly undertake preparatory classes in English for Academic Purposes (EAP), delivered in language institutes which exist as independent commercial colleges on the margins of the university. EAP has been criticized for taking a purely pragmatic approach of &#8216;skilling up&#8217; students rather than taking a critical, &#8216;literacies&#8217; approach appropriate to the rapidly globalising, &#8216;liquid&#8217; contexts of the twenty-first century (Doherty &amp; Singh, 2005; Lea &amp; Street, 2006; Luke, 2002b). In this thesis, I explore the ways in which EAP reading pedagogies in Australian universities are responding to this call for a more critical approach, asking the question: Do learning environments in EAP support the development of critical reading practices, and if so, how? In seeking answers to this question, I used an ethnographic-ecological methodology (van Lier, 2004b) to gain an understanding of reading pedagogy in three EAP learning environments. The study inevitably generated vast amounts of &#8216;messy&#8217; data, including transcriptions of classes, observation notes, interviews and examples of students&#8217; written work. Using Christie&#8217;s tools of Classroom Discourse Analysis (Christie, 2002) in combination with Engestr&#246;m&#8217;s third generation Activity Theory (Engestr&#246;m, 1999; Lantolf &amp; Thorne, 2006) it was possible to generate a holistic analysis of the interaction between the multiple, intersecting elements of each environment. I argue that more attention needs to be paid to &#8216;critical engagement&#8217; in EAP pedagogy. The data suggest that conditions for such a pedagogy entail a negotiation of goals; texts and tasks which present high challenge as well as high support (Hammond &amp; Gibbons, 2005); and a positive and productive classroom community (D&#246;rnyei &amp; Murphey, 2003). The study challenges teachers to see their role not as &#8216;arbiters of meaning&#8217;, mediating texts FOR students, but as setting up learning environments which scaffold students&#8217; direct engagement and dialogue WITH texts, so that they themselves can experience legitimate participation in constructing meaning, and develop an emerging identity as critical readers. Finally, I argue that the constraints of EAP in its marginalised position on the periphery of increasingly commercialised universities militate against the possibility of a richly critical, postcritical pedagogy. EAP can, however, begin to sow the seeds of critical reading practices, orienting students towards an active, dialogic engagement with the texts they will meet in the coming years at university.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English for academic purposes.</field><field name="subject">Academic writing.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hegemony, anti-hegemony and counter-hegemony : control, resistance and coups in Fiji.</field><field name="creator">Ramesh, Sanjay</field><field name="description">The thesis argues that the colonial state in Fiji was founded upon ethno-cultural divisions, which continued in the post-colonial period with the establishment of indigenous chiefly political hegemony. By using a neo-Gramscian analytical framework based on the centrality of the role of ethnicity and culture in the study of colonial and post-colonial societies, the thesis develops three inter-related themes for the analysis of Fiji&#8217;s political history: the role of colonial culture, the importance of ethno-cultural divisions, and the changing role of the military in hegemony, antihegemony and counter-hegemony. The thesis proposes a dynamic model of decolonisation that conceptualises Fiji&#8217;s post-colonial political history in terms of hegemonic cycles that sees indigenous chiefly hegemony subside into factionalisation of the indigenous polity, inter-ethnic alliances and coercive indigenous assertion. These cycles operate as a product of conflict between hegemonic, anti-hegemonic and counter-hegemonic forces. The study finds that the hegemonic cycles were interrupted by a failed indigenous coercive phase in 2000 which led to military counter-hegemony and the ouster of the indigenous political order in 2006. The thesis notes that the re-alignment of indigenous political forces, following the latest military intervention, had the potential to re-instate the hegemonic cycles. The neo-Gramscian model developed in the thesis has a projective element and can be used to analyse the role of ethnicity and culture in colonial and postcolonial hegemonies such as in the South Pacific region.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiji.</field><field name="subject">Coups d'&#233;tat.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economy of nature: a genealogy of the concepts 'growth' and 'equilibrium' as artefacts of metaphorical exchange between the natural and the social sciences.</field><field name="creator">Walker, Jeremy R.</field><field name="description">Presently, the more or less global political consensus is that the primary task of government is to perpetually maximise a quantity called 'economic growth'. Given the decline of 'socialist' models of industrialisation, the economic consensus is that economic growth is best achieved through the deregulation of markets, industry and trade, as free markets are self-regulating institutions that automatically and efficiently optimise growth through their tendency to reach 'equilibrium.' Another word for this consensus might be 'neoliberalism'. This cosy situation, however, is increasingly under challenge from the recent transformation of global warming from a deniable proposition to a clear and present danger. As ecologists and earth scientists have long argued, global warming (an unforeseen side effect of what was called the 'energy crisis' in the 1970s) is just one of many aspects of a generalised global ecological crisis. The biosphere, environmentalists tell us, is radically 'out of balance'. Given this impasse, it appears that the science of social systems (economics) and the science of living systems (ecology) are incommensurable. This incommensurability is the starting point of the thesis, which seeks to provide a genealogy of the concepts of equilibrium and growth as they appear in the claims of both disciplines to represent 'hard' science. Drawing from debates in the philosophy of science, studies in the history of ideas, the anthropology of technology, and political economy, the thesis charts the mutual exchange of metaphors and analogies between the natural and the social sciences, and traces a surprisingly parallel trajectory in the separate histories of economics and ecology. Beginning with early historicist and organicist conceptual frameworks, both sciences embraced 'mechanism' in their bid to attain the mantle of Science. For both sciences, the attainment of this status was associated with the incorporation of the language of energetics and an insistent identification of 'equilibrium' with the central scientific object of inquiry, 'the market' and 'the ecosystem' respectively. What is ironic in these claims is that the acceptance of the machine metaphor effecti vely screened out the study of actual machinery from the pure states of nature called 'the market' or 'the economy.' This history is taken up to the climactic moment of the early 1970s, when, it is argued, the ontological foundations of ecology and economics collided. This is the moment from which the political discourses of neoliberal globalisation and global environmental crisis both date, and since then we see the rise of hybrid discourses that attempt to address and overcome the deep contradictions of disciplinary specialisation. The thesis concludes with a brief discussion of the implications of this conceptual legacy, and in analysing the interactions of the 'new ecology' and the 'new economy', offers suggestions as to why what appeared in 1971 as a fundamental and obvious contradiction between 'growth' and 'equilibrium', no longer attracts debate.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Equilibrium (Economics)</field><field name="subject">Economic development.</field><field name="subject">Sustainable development.</field><field name="subject">Environmentalism.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/841</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Business orientated resource diversification in smaller social service nonprofits: why some are adopting and others are not.</field><field name="creator">Feeney, Melisah Carol</field><field name="description">One of the current key challenges for nonprofit social service organisations is how to diversify resource mobilisation practices in order to build sustainable organisations that can innovatively achieve social mission. Two approaches to resource mobilisation that are promoted within Australia are social enterprise and partnering with business. Both of these approaches involve a re-orientation toward business, either in management practices or through an enduring relationship. Despite an increased interest in business-focused resource mobilisation strategies there are few successful examples of social enterprise and partnering with business emerging across the nonprofit sector. There is also scant empirically based research to understand what it takes to adopt these practices, what the consequences of adoption might be and how governments, nonprofits and business stakeholders might support their emergence. This research aims to build an evidence base to provide greater understanding of these issues. The thesis analyses data from fourteen organisational case studies of nonprofit social service organisations located across Australia. Seven of these organisations were selected because they had adopted an enterprising form of resource mobilisation and had been recognised for their achievements in this area. The other seven organisations matched these adopters in terms of mission, location, size and stage of organisational development, though had less diversified resource streams and had not attempted or successfully managed to develop a social enterprise or business partnership. Case-orientated research and qualitative comparative analysis was used in order to achieve causal complexity and a 'configurational' view of the cases (Ragin 1999). The thesis details the conditions that are both necessary and sufficient for business-focused resource mobilisation .processes to be adopted. Organisational capacity and self-efficacy are critical conditions that open up resource innovation possibilities; there is a range of other sufficient conditions that work in combination with these. There are value and ideological challenges to be negotiated by nonprofit social service organisations as they are called upon, both internally and from without, to reinvent the means with which they achieving organisational sustainability. This tension creates the need for new thinking at the level of policy and practice - across all sectors - in order that these critical organisations that bear responsibility for the social good can successful organise within the contemporary context.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/847</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The shadow pricing of labour in cost benefit analysis of infrastructure projects : theory and application to Sydney's second airport project</field><field name="creator">Saleh, Iraj</field><field name="description">In project appraisal of infrastructure projects, cost benefit analysis has an important role. One of the central concerns is to adjust the distortions in markets to provide a better guide to a more effective allocation of scarce resources. The objectives of this thesis are : to establish the lack of a comprehensive estimation of the shadow wage rate (SWR) in most project appraisals in the Australian context; to develop a model for the estimation of the SWR for groups of occupations; to estimate the SWRs for the major groups of occupations in Australia; to forecast the number of employees required for Sydney's second airport project and to apply the estimated SWRs to the project, followed by estimation of the total social cost of the project. The latter estimation is done using a novel approach which, unlike many previous studies of transport infrastructure projects, estimates the SWR entirely from published statistical sources. Overall, the results are significant not only in the context of Sydney's second airport, but for other airports, the transportation sector, and in general for Australian project appraisal. The study proposes the need to change the traditional approach to the treatment of labour costs in project appraisal in Australia and provides a framework which can be useful to other researchers and analysts who wish to examine the pricing of labour in Australian project appraisal.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">project appraisal</field><field name="subject">costs</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">airports</field><field name="subject">infrastructure</field><field name="subject">labour</field><field name="subject">wages</field><field name="subject">shadow prices</field><field name="subject">pricing</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">staff</field><field name="subject">transportation sector</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attitude and achievement of females in science : girls in single sex classes in the coeducational environment</field><field name="creator">Hayward, Ian</field><field name="description">There can be many influences affecting girls in secondary high schools which in turn produce many different outcomes on their progression through high school.

One possible outcome is that of the number of females selecting science at the senior secondary level being disproportionately low when compared to males. This thesis investigates one proposed method of increasing, the currently low, numbers of females selecting the physical sciences in Year 11 and Year 12 by examining attitudes and achievements of females when placed in a single sex class in a coeducational school. The results were unexpected when examined in light of the literature reviewed.

Educational authorities in Australia, the United States of America and the United Kingdom have come to recommend the student use of calculators from Kindergarten upwards. This recommendation has attracted continuing controversy, specifically regarding the use of, calculators in primary schools. Such controversy prompts an important question: What views do primary teachers themselves hold on this issue? This report examined the findings of a study into primary teachers' present attitudes toward the student use of calculators in primary mathematics classes. Data were collected from a questionnaire administered during 1990 to a sample of teachers undertaking their fourth year of study for a Bachelor of Education (Primary) at three university campuses in New South Wales, Australia. Those teachers who supported the primary student use of calculators believed that calculators are a technological tool for use in mathematics, that they increase childrens' confidence, they take the focus off computation in doing problems and that children use them outside the classroom. It was found that of these teachers, 55% supported the introduction of calculators before the end of Year 2. A total of 4% did not support their use at all in primary mathematics classes.

An analysis of the organizational situation showed among other factors, the apparent lack of a mechanism that relates the organization's research findings to policy making. Through action researching and using the Soft Systems Methodology as a framewrok, an action plan was developed which is designed to improve the situation. The document also discusses insights and lessons learnt in the conduct of action research. Particular focus was placed on key issues that affect individual participation and organizational actions; and how action research fares as a potential framework for organic and systemic change. From the examination of the action research experience, it became apparent that in order to fully harness the potentials of action researching, opportunities for individual participation must be well distributed and taken by the action research members. The factors affecting individual participation in group processes such as group needs, group culture and power issues in and out of the group, must likewise be addressed. This is to promote coordination, commitment and critical consciousness among group members which are essential in effecting organic and systemic change. As the research was conducted within the broad setting of agricultural research, where efforts are placed to enhance agricultural development, this document likewise discusses the potential of action research as an alternative framewrok for Research and Development (R and D) activities. It presents how action research can mobilize grassroots initiatives and actions which are crucial to a sustainable agricultural development.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">grassroots initiative</field><field name="subject">sustainable agricultural development</field><field name="subject">policy making</field><field name="subject">group needs</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/185</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Income distribution and poverty in Iran</field><field name="creator">Assadzadeh, Ahmad</field><field name="description">This study analyses income inequality and poverty in the rural and urban sectors in Iran during the post Islamic revolution period, 1983-1993. It has been based on household level data relating to the Household Income and Expenditure Surveys conducted by the Statistical Centre of Iran for 1983, 1988 and 1993. The study starts with a brief review of the main features of the Iranian economy. This is followed by a brief discussion of the data. An analysis of temporal changes in income distribution and welfare, the contributions of factor income components on per capita income inequality, a detailed analysis of absolute poverty, earnings behaviour of full time urban male workers. The final chapter summarises and brings together the main conclusions. By and large, the finding of this study are quite rich and provide a very clean picture in the levels of income inequality, welfare and absolute poverty. Most of the changes in income inequality and poverty observed in this study seem to be, to some extent, the reflections, if not the outcomes, of government policies, strategies and war related activities and shortages etc. Based on the Iranian experience, we can say that political stability, accompanied by consistent and sustainable macroeconomic policies can ensure a reduction in income inequality and absolute poverty in a developing country.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">political stability</field><field name="subject">Islamic Revolution</field><field name="subject">income inequality</field><field name="subject">macroeconomics</field><field name="subject">developing country</field><field name="subject">poverty in Iran</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between the annualised volatility and correlation of G7 ten-year bond returns</field><field name="creator">Hollander, Martin B. L.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the relationship between the annualised volatility and correlation of G7 ten-year bond returns for the period July 1992 to June 1998 and the effects that such a relationship has on portfolio diversification. The stock market crash of 1987 and the growing importance of global equity markets has encouraged a plethora of research into the volatility and correlations between international equity markets. Despite this, very little attention has been paid to the transmission of currency-based bond returns across national boundaries. The findings in this thesis are important because evidence is provided that suggests the benefits of international bond diversification are limited. The evidence provided clearly indicates that because correlations amongst G7 currency-hedged bond returns are high, the relationship between bond volatility and correlation of returns has limited benefits for portfolio managers and traders. As a result, diversification may not significantly reduce portfolio risk. Even during periods of ongoing annualised volatility decreases, the correlation between most markets remains high. Unlike the volatility trends presented in this thesis, there appears to be no trend or consistency amongst the correlation of returns between G7 markets.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">government securities</field><field name="subject">bond market</field><field name="subject">stock market</field><field name="subject">investment</field><field name="subject">financial market</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/23</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of long-term dependence in time-series data</field><field name="creator">Ellis, Craig</field><field name="description">Traditional models of financial asset yields are based on a number of simplifying assumptions. Among these are the primary assumptions that changes in asset yields are independent, and that the distribution of these yields is approximately normal. The development of financial asset pricing models has also incorporated these assumptions. A general feature of the pricing models is that the relationship between the model variables is fundamentally linear. Recent empirical research has however identified the possibility for these relations to be non-linear. The empirical research focused primarily on methodological issues relating to the application of the classical rescaled adjusted range. Some of the major issues investigated were: the use of overlapping versus contiguous subseries lengths in the calculation of the statistic's Hurst exponent; the asymptotic distribution of the Hurst exponent for Gaussian time-series and long-term dependent fBm's; matters pertaining to the estimation of the expected rescaled adjusted range. Empirical research in this thesis also considered alternate applications of rescaled range analysis, other than modelling non-linear long-term dependence. Issues relating to the use of the technique for estimating long-term dependent ARFIMA processes, and some implications of long-term dependence for financial time-series have both been investigated. Overall, the general shape of the asymptotic distribution of the Hurst exponent has been shown to be invariant to the level of dependence in the underlying series. While the rescaled adjusted range is a biased indicator of the level of long-term dependence in simulated time-series, it was found that the bias could be efficiently modelled. For real time-series containing structured short-term dependence, the bias was shown to be inconsistent with the simulated results.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">asset yields</field><field name="subject">Gaussian time-series</field><field name="subject">Hurst exponent</field><field name="subject">pricing models</field><field name="subject">non-linear</field><field name="subject">simulated time series</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an analytical method for the analysis of flumetsulam in soybean by HPLC-UV and LC-MS/MS</field><field name="creator">Moawad, Michael</field><field name="description">Flumetsulam &#8230; is a member of the triazolopyrimidine sulfonanilide family of herbicides. It is used for pre or post-emergence broadleaf weed control in wheat, corn, barley and soybean. It has low toxicity and is readily degradable. A HPLC-UV method for the analysis of flumetsulam with the use of a surrogate and internal standard was developed and validated for soybean. The surrogate and internal standards are diclosulam and benzoic acid respectively. A LC-ESI-MS/MS confirmation method in the positive ion mode was also developed for flumetsulam. In the solvent-solvent extraction method, flumetsulam was extracted from the soybean with MeOH and the extract partitioned with a hexane:MTBE mixture (which was discarded). In the solid phase extraction and clean up method, C-18, SAX and SCX cartridges were used. Flumetsulam was extracted from the soybean as for the solvent-solvent extraction method. The solvent-solvent extraction method was used for flumetsulam determination at fortification levels of 10, 20, 50 and 100 ng -g soybean -1. The method has average absolute recoveries of 80% (range 72 to 90%). The absolute precision of recovery is about 16% and the detection limit is 4.8 ng g-1.The solid phase extraction method was used for flumetsulam determination at fortification levels of 20, 50, and 100 ng (ng soybean )-1.

AFP also interacted with microbial activity, moisture levels altered by covering/uncovering media and water severity of pythium damping-off. It has not been possible to determine a narrow range of AFP required to achieve consistently suppressive media, as AFP has been found to interact with many factors such as microbial activity, temperature shock of media and plants and moisture levels modified by covering and uncovering media, or using different pot heights to modify WHC. The use of different batches of compost and ageing of compost in the seven experiments reported here may also account for some of the different effects of AFP on the severity of Pythium disease. It is not recommended that AFP be used for controlling Pythium damping-off, unless certain conditions, such as microbial activity, can be controlled to a range of specifications also. Variability of compost is one of the principal factors limiting its widespread use, so therefore, improving the quality control during the composting process would be the principal factor which should be investigated in future.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microbial</field><field name="subject">pythium</field><field name="subject">porosity</field><field name="subject">moisture</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="subject">compos</field><field name="subject">plants</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/26</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Job satisfaction, gendered work-lives and orientations to work</field><field name="creator">George, Ranjan Michael Jeyadas</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of gender and organisation in Sri Lanka, a society of diverse cultural identities. The research question addresses factors related to women and men's orientations to work and the extent to which institutional factors, located in the broader societal context of Sri Lankan organisations, add explanatory power in analysis of the degree of job satisfaction and work perceptions. The thesis also investigates the relationship between organisational level attributes and the understanding of managers' work perceptions, as well as seeking variation at the institutional level. The main research instrument was a questionnaire, and quantitative data was generated from field surveys of 382 Sri Lankan male and female managers. The data is stratified randomly, forming a sample of top, middle and junior level managers. These managers belong to diverse Sri Lankan organisations in terms of size, ownership, and line of business. The findings illustrate that organisational level attributes have greater explanatory power in interpreting the work perceptions of male and female managers in Sri Lanka than do the institutional factors. However, qualitative interviews that were conducted reveal the salience of institutional factors to explain aspects of work perceptions. Organisational policies and recommendations that can be derived from this finding are elaborated in the conclusions.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">organisational attributes</field><field name="subject">work perceptions</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cellular differentiation and antibiotic production by Streptomyces nodosus immobilised in alginate capsules</field><field name="creator">Pereira, Tanya</field><field name="description">Encapsulation is a novel technique that involves the entrapment of materials such as cells, enzymes or chemicals within a semi-permeable matrix and is being explored as a drug delivery system. This project investigated the encapsulation of Streptomyces nodosus in alginate to assess whether this organism can produce the antifungal drug amphotericin B from within the matrix. New methods were developed to immobilise S. nodosus mycelia and spores in alginate capsules, assess bacterial viability and detect ng mL&#8211;1 quantities of amphotericin B in culture fluids. When capsules were cultured and cell proliferation was encouraged, organisms formed protrusions on the surface of the capsules. Differentiated branched hyphae that never progressed to sporogenic hyphae were observed on the surface of these structures. Viability was maintained for up to 30 days and low levels of amphotericin B were produced. The emergence of a co-existing free-dwelling population was also observed. Culturing immobilised organisms using conditioned media from an amphotericin deficient S. nodosus strain, augmented the development of the free-dwelling population resulting in the detection of amphotericin B in the culture fluid and full differentiation to sporogenic hyphae. This is the first report of sporulation of S. nodosus in liquid environments and demonstrates that immobilised S. nodosus can produce antibiotics. The sporulation of free-dwelling organisms was also induced using conditioned media and manipulation of quorum size, indicating a solid surface is not required for sporulation. Conditioned media from other Streptomyces spp. induced variable responses including sporulation, pigment formation and antibiotic production, possibly demonstrating communication between species and/or alteration in nutritional status. This new model for the life cycle of S. nodosus will permit the study of developmental pathways, antibiotic production, microbial community structure and inter-species and intra-species signalling.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">streptomyces nodosus</field><field name="subject">streptomyces</field><field name="subject">genetics</field><field name="subject">antibiotics</field><field name="subject">biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Amphotericin B</field><field name="subject">antifungal agents</field><field name="subject">microencapsulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/20504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nonlinear paraxial equation at laser plasma interaction</field><field name="creator">Osman, Frederick</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an investigation into the behaviour of a laser beam of finite diameter in a plasma with respect to forces and optical properties, which lead to self-focusing of the beam. The transient setting of ponderomotive nonlinearity in a collisionless plasma has been studied, and consequently the self- focusing of the pulse, and the focusing of the plasma wave occurs. The description of a self-focusing mechanism of laser radiation in the plasma due to nonlinear forces acting on the plasma in the lateral direction, relative to the laser has been investigated in the non-relativistic regime. The behaviour of the laser beams in plasma, which is the domain of self-focusing at high or moderate intensity, is dominated by the nonlinear force. The investigation of self-focusing processes of laser beams in plasma result from the relativistic mass and energy dependency of the refractive index at high laser intensities. Here the relativistic effects are considered to evaluate the relativistic self-focusing lenghts for the neodymium glass radiation, at different plasma densities of various laser intensities. A sequence of code in C++ has been developed to explore in depth self-focusing over a wide range of parameters. The nonlinear plasma dielectric function to relativistic electron motion will be derived in the latter part of this thesis. From that, one can obtain the nonlinear refractive index of the plasma and estimate the importance of relativistic self-focusing as compared to ponderomotive non-relativistic self-focusing, at very high laser intensities. When the laser intensity is very high, pondermotive self-focusing will be dominant. But at some point, when the oscillating velocity of the plasma electron becomes very large, relativistic effects will also play a role in self-focusing. A numerical and theoretical study of the generation and propagation of oscillation in the semiclassical limit of the nonlinear paraxial equation is presented in this thesis. In a general setting of both dimension and nonlinearity, the essential differences between the 'defocusing' and 'focusing' cases hence is identified. Presented in this thesis are the nonlinearity and dispersion effects involved in the propagation of solitions which can be understood by using a numerical routines were implemented through the use of the mathematica program, and results give a very clear idea of this interesting phenomena</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plasma</field><field name="subject">nonlinear</field><field name="subject">paraxial</field><field name="subject">laser beams</field><field name="subject">oscillation</field><field name="subject">dispersion</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Occurrence of arbuscular mycorrhizae in castanospermum australe and their effect on growth and production of catanospermine (anti virus alkaloid)</field><field name="creator">Abu-Zeyad, Raeda</field><field name="description">The present study was aimed to find out if there is any symbioses between C.australe roots and mycorrhizal fungi. This research also aimed to investigate the effect of Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on the growth of C.australe and the yield of alkaloid castanospermine. The rhizosphere soil and roots of C.australe from various sites in Sydney were collected. Roots were stained with vital and non-vital stains for assessment of mycorrhizal infection. The result indicated that AM fungi symbiotic associations with the roots of C.australe, producing arbuscules and vesicles in the root cortices. By wet sieving and decanting of rhizosphere soil, spores and sporocarps of AM fungi, were recovered. The spores mainly belonged to the genus Glomus. A correlation study was conducted to determine the relationship between the AM infection percentage in the roots and the Castanospermine amount in the leaves and seeds of the field grown trees. The results showed that there is a positive relationship between the castanospermine amount in the seeds and AM infection percentages in the roots. The effect of phosphorus on the yield of castanospermine was also investigated. The results indicated that phosphorus do enhance castanospermine at certain levels, but a further increase in phosphorus application resulted in reduced AM infection. It was found that AM has a great effect on the growth and production of C.australe and biosynthesis of castanospermine.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Moreton Bay chestnut</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organising modes of law firms</field><field name="creator">Gray, John T.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines why law firms are organised as they are.

The focus of the study was the relationship between student participation and school context in Barracks High. Underpinning the study is the notion of 'meaningful' participation: that is, participation by students that has real meaning to them, to teachers, and for the real work of the school. This notion is explored in the review of related literature, and in the results of the study as they are presented in the thesis. The study involved persistent researcher engagement in school life, leading at times to forms of 'intervention research'.A highlight of the research was the identification and dissemination by the researcher of participant 'voices' within Barracks High as a means of drawing attention to participation issues in the school. The study found that contextual dimensions at Barracks High operated at a ratio of two to one against the achievement of meaningful forms of student participation.

Simple Cournot-Nash types of games have been developed, where the market is a duopoly containing a privatised firm with the other firm being a new entrant. These games examine the efficacy and impacts of privatisation, and the role of government in this duopoly. The thesis endrogenously derives multiple equilibria in the duopolistic market; examines decontrolling/deregulating a vertical market; looks at the potential competition in vertical markets and examines potential collusion among existing firms to forestall entry; and addresses issues of privatisation in successive duopolies with cooperative investments.

To fulfill this task two complementary studies were carried out; a theoretical investigation and an empirical research. First, this critically examines existing theories in the sociology of knowledge and art and focuses on the problem of the 'social determination of art and literature.' This examination is based in the consideration of art as an element in the knowledge sphere and the sociology of art as a branch of the sociology of knowledge. A critique of the notion of the 'social determination of art' leads to a set of hypotheses which are tested in the field. The question of great art problematises the 'social determination' hypotheses. Secondly, an empirical study of Australian playwrights is carried out which examines the hypotheses derived from the theoretical investigation. The empirical methods of this study is a survey, using a mail questionnaire, supported by interviews with professionals in Australian drama. This is combined with a documentary study of the socio-economic conditions of Australia during the last 25 years, together with content analysis of plays written by Australian playwrights during the same period. The results of the empirical investigation support the proposed hypotheses showing that while social conditions effect contemporary artistic works, this effect is not uniform when comparing 'first rate' of 'great art' with other artistic creations. This questions the concept of the social determination of art explored in the thesis, and at the same time questions the extent and scope of such a determination. Finally, the conclusion of the thesis is that sociology is relevant in the analysis of artistic works so long as it is concerned with the social dimension of art. It is concluded that the aesthetic knowledge of the artist, which determines the quality of artistic works, is independent from social forces. Although art bears the mark of contemporary social conditions, it is not a product of these conditions.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">art and society</field><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">literature and society</field><field name="subject">drama</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/28857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rescuing the rising generation : industrial schools in New South Wales, 1850-1910</field><field name="creator">Scrivener, Gladys</field><field name="description">The Industrial Schools Act introduced State coercion into the &#8216;childcare&#8217; of the colony, and industrial schools became legal enforcers for other welfare institutions. This thesis provides an account of two industrial schools in nineteenth and early twentieth century New South Wales, focusing on the children and the lives they lived within the institutions and relying heavily upon primary sources. NSS Vernon enrolled destitute, neglected and delinquent boys. The curriculum, combined with an elaborate system of rewards, proved effective as reformative agents and after 1911 the ship&#8217;s coercive function was taken over by other reformatory schools and by a system of probation. About one third of girls admitted to ISG Newcastle were older, sexually delinquent girls. Inappropriate site, inadequate preparation, insufficient and untrained staff, lack of suitable curriculum and denial of support from the Colonial Secretary led to total failure of the school. Physical and verbal abuse was in evidence at Newcastle and resurfaced after the change of enrollments to mostly older girls about the time of the school&#8217;s transfer to Parramatta in 1887. After 1905 committals were aimed at maintaining street order and parental authority, to house the &#8216;uncontrollables&#8217; and &#8216;incompetents&#8217; and to provide a lock hospital for the control of venereal disease.

Accordingly, depending on their direct or peripheral relevance to the research topic, some areas have been researched more comprehensively than others. In addition, some issues have richer research bases than others. As examples, the literature on strategic management theory is quite comprehensive, but it is not the central focus of the topic, whereas the structure of the tourism industry is crucial to an analysis of its vulnerability but literature on this issue is sparse and fragmented. Notwithstanding these limitations this literature review attempts to encompass all relevant research areas in a logical manner, proceeding from a cursory examination of the economic and social significance of the tourism industry, its research and definitional issues; through a considerably more comprehensive analysis of its complex inter- and intra- sectoral structures and relationships with its multiple business environments; towards an exploration of the application of vulnerability/sustainability and strategic/crisis management theories. Specifically, the review is divided into the following sections: the nature of the tourism industry; the business environments for tourism; vulnerability and sustainability, strategic and crisis management. The structure parallels the framework used in the accompanying rationale. All sections analyse the major issues of the relevant literature and discuss them in relation to the vulnerability and sustainability of the international tourism industry. The review concludes with an overall summary of the significant themes and dilemmas.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Western Sydney (N.S.W.)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/31054</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Navigating a palliative approach in residential aged care using a population based focus</field><field name="creator">Phillips, Jane</field><field name="description">Changes in demographic patterns and the burden of chronic illness have challenged palliative care clinicians to engage populations other than those with malignant disease. This new paradigm has promoted the development of a population based approach to service delivery which aims to extend the reach of palliative care to hard to reach populations, including older people in residential aged care. In Australia, the high levels of disability and death experienced by older people in this care setting has resulted in policy promoting the delivery of a palliative approach to care. Achieving health care reform in this complex health care environment has traditionally been difficult to realise due to a range of workforce, training, funding, variable organizational philosophies and legal factors. The &#8220;Residential - Palliative Approach Competency&#8221; (R-PAC) Project aimed to collaboratively develop, implement and evaluate a sustainable model of care to facilitate the delivery of a palliative approach to care for older people admitted to residential aged care facilities, in regional Australian. Action research, with a focus on improving care and involving participants, was used to promote the delivery of a palliative approach in residential aged care facilities. The R-PAC Project was designed to follow the action research sequence of reflection, assessment, planning, action and observation. Nested within the action research method are eight distinct but interrelated studies in a mixed method design. Study A, a focused needs assessment undertaken as part of the preliminary investigations, confirms that older people in aged care have unmet palliative care needs. The three studies conducted during Phase One provide a greater understanding of delivering palliative care in the residential aged care setting. Study B, a chart audit identified the strengths and gaps in end-of-life care provision in the local aged care setting. While, Study C identified that aged care nurses and care assistants are committed and compassionate about delivering palliative care but desired greater palliative care competencies. The palliative care attitudes, values and learning needs of aged care providers were explored in greater depth in Study D. The data from these investigations guided the development and implementation of a multifaceted intervention during Phase Two. Following the implementation of the multi-faceted intervention and during Phase Three another series of investigations was undertaken to measure the impact of the collaborative intervention. Focus groups were used to determine the perceptions of aged care providers toward the multi-faceted intervention (Study E) and to seek the views of general practitioners (Study F). These data revealed that aged care nurses and general practitioners wanted to establish a more collaborative approach to care planning and delivery. The survey (Study G) and chart audits (Study H) were repeated in Phase Four in order to measure the impact of the action. The findings of the survey of aged care nurses and care assistants shown an increase in palliative care competencies, while the chart audit demonstrated positive trends in improving end-of-life care. Although, some aspects of care, particularly advance care planning and routine use of pain assessment tools required ongoing attention. This data propel the R-PAC Project into Phase Five and the development of a model of care to promote the delivery of a palliative approach, which was informed by the research findings. The R-PAC Project use of the action research method has facilitated a cascade of engagement and participation of all residential aged care facilities in this regional community and enabled practice innovation. The project has seen the sharing of valuable insights into usual practice and collaboratively engaging aged care nurses, care assistants and general practitioners in developing practical solutions to end-of-life care. This process has allowed for the acknowledgement and validation of the role of aged care providers, fostered personal empowerment and identified the importance of collaboration. This research has provided greater insight into the palliative care needs of people in residential aged care and collaboratively developed an intervention to improve the outcomes of older people. Study findings have also identified important issues requiring ongoing evaluation, particularly multidisciplinary team meetings and care planning.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">palliative treatment</field><field name="subject">nursing homes</field><field name="subject">medical care</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/33324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The taxation of the offshore oil industry</field><field name="creator">Smith, Dominic Scott</field><field name="description">Until recent years the proportion contributed to total government revenue by the petroleum industry has continued to increase. However, Australia's oil reserves are now diminishing as known fields are consumed, and exploration efforts have failed to locate new sources of petroleum. The oil industry has called for the relaxation of the government take in order to encourage exploration activity for the replacement of reserves. In an environment of low world prices and continuing high levels of taxation it has been submitted that the balance between taxation and exploration incentives has tipped against exploration activity. The broader economic consequences of lower self sufficiency are significant, particularly in terms of the current account deficit and economic security. The most contentious form of government revenue is secondary taxation. These taxes are levied in addition to company income tax. The present Federal Government has introduced a Petroleum Resource Rent Tax to ensure the community, as a whole, gains an equitable share from the diminution of the country's scarce natural resources. Government discussion on tax reform has concentrated on the most appropriate form of secondary taxation without first examining whether there is, in fact, a case for the imposition of any secondary taxes. This paper addresses the impact of the range of taxes which apply to the petroleum industry. Particular attention is given to the alternate forms of secondary taxation and their effect on the industry in terms of the commonly used criteria for evaluating taxes. These criteria are : equity; efficiency and simplicity. Using this framework the various taxes are analysed individually. Beyond the oil industry the thesis will examine the broader economic effects of petroleum taxation policy, and review the political environment that gives rise to Government policy. From a business perspective, it is in the interests of the oil industry to minimise taxation because of its inverse relationship with profitability. In the light of this objective analysis, the thesis aims to determine the most appropriate form and level of taxation for the petroleum industry in Australia.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">petroleum</field><field name="subject">taxation</field><field name="subject">secondary taxes</field><field name="subject">equity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/390</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of emerging property sectors in property portfolios</field><field name="creator">Peng, Hsu Wen</field><field name="description">Institutional investors have typically involved commercial property in their core portfolios for stable and income-oriented returns, particularly concentrated on low-risk traditional property sectors including office, retail and industrial property. Recent years have seen the strong growth in demand for quality commercial properties resulting in an imbalanced property investment market, with significant capital flows available (eg: growth in superannuation fund assets) for property investment from this increased appetite for commercial property. This has also been driven by some basic factors such as changing demographics. The demographic change has affected savings, investment and capital flows as the elderly prefer investments with the characteristics of higher yield and stability. Due to the ageing population, a compulsory superannuation system was introduced by the Australian government in 1992 which has driven significant increased capital flowing into investment markets. Since the increased capital flowed into investment markets with significantly compressed property yields, institutional investors have considered a range of emerging property sector investments such as self-storage, retirement, healthcare, and leisure properties to enhance the performance and provide diversification benefits in their portfolios. Specifically, recent years have also seen infrastructure emerge as a separate asset class for institutional capital, with the infrastructure asset class having distinctive characteristics and attractive features; particularly in a climate of significantly reduced government spending on infrastructure in most countries, as governments seek alternative funding options for infrastructure development and maintenance. However, only limited studies regarding the performance of the emerging property sectors and infrastructure investments have been conducted. As such, this PhD thesis focuses on both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the investment issues for the emerging property sectors and infrastructure. To provide a fuller view of the emerging property sectors and infrastructure, the empirical analysis in this thesis provided the performance assessments of Australian emerging property sector LPTs, US non-traditional REITs, UK direct leisure property, Australian infrastructure, US infrastructure and European infrastructure, as well as the strategic investment issues regarding emerging property sector and infrastructure investment via surveys with Australian emerging property sector LPT and infrastructure fund managers. With the development of an emerging property sector LPT index, the results of the empirical analysis indicate Australian emerging properties are characterised as higher risk-higher return property investments. The diversification benefit has been confirmed as adding emerging properties to an investment portfolio. The emerging property sector LPT fund managers&#8217; survey has found new product diversity, strong performance, enhanced yield, greater choice of property and significant capital inflow available for property as the essential motivating factors for emerging property sector investment; whilst the quality and availability of data, the competition of emerging property investments/acquisitions, the depth of market and identifying reliable/strategic business partners, and the policy and regulation issues have been identified as the most significant risks in emerging property sector investment. For US non-traditional REIT analysis, self-storage REITs presented strong performance over the study period. The efficient frontier of portfolios consisting of self-storage REITs also presented enhanced efficiency, while healthcare and specialty REIT portfolios showed less significant efficiency. Due to no equivalent public emerging property series being available for UK, a direct leisure property total return series is obtained from IPD as the proxy of leisure property investment performance. Leisure property outperformed the other property sectors, as well as the other asset classes over the 26-year period to 2006. Similarly, the findings of the property portfolio and mixed-asset portfolio analyses suggest that adding leisure property to the UK property portfolios or mixed-asset portfolios has resulted in significant diversification gains. The findings of the infrastructure analyses have shown the consistent results of enhanced returns, lower risk and significantly improved diversification benefits by infrastructure investments over the three major infrastructure markets including Australia, US and Europe. With the rapidly expanding market in recent years, the strong performance and volatility of infrastructure investment has been moderate when the infrastructure markets are maturing. The Australian infrastructure fund managers&#8217; survey has found stable cash flows, long duration, greater understanding of infrastructure, monopoly characteristics, inflation hedging and diversification benefits as the essential motivating factors for infrastructure investment; whilst infrastructure policy and over-valued infrastructure have been identified as the most significant risks in infrastructure investment. As the emerging property sectors and infrastructure are maturing as effective and significant investment vehicles in Australia and internationally, the issues assessed in this thesis taking on increased significance in the future. It is clearly evident that the property and infrastructure research in this thesis has lead to the enhanced understanding of alternative property and property-related assets and a fuller understanding of the investment dynamics of the emerging property sectors and infrastructure.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">real estate investment</field><field name="subject">portfolio management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/33112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the presence and survival of campylobacter species in the Sydney rock oyster (Crassostrea commercialia)</field><field name="creator">Arumugaswamy, Ramakrishnaswamy</field><field name="description">A direct enrichment procedure has been developed for selectively recovering low numbers of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli from oyster tissue.

In this study the procedure has been used to study the occurrence of thermophilic campylobacters in Sydney rock oysters. Seventy nine samples were screened during the winter months of April to July in 1985. Approximately 8% of the samples contained C.jejuni and 6% of the samples were positive for C.coli. The survival of C.jejuni and C.coli in the Sydney rock oyster was also investigated and results discussed. In contaminated shell stock stored at 20 and 30 degrees Centigrade, C.jejuni and C.coli survived for periods varying from 2 to 9 days. The failure of the organism to multiply in oyster tissue at any of these temperatures studied is an important phenomenon.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">campylobacter</field><field name="subject">diseases in oysters</field><field name="subject">Sydney rock oysters</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systems analysis undertaken to improve employer awareness of and career opportunities for Hawkesbury agriculturalists</field><field name="creator">Potts, W. H. C.</field><field name="description">Beginning in 1978, the learning paradigm of the Faculty of Agriculture at the (now) University of Western Sydney - Hawkesbury was progressivly altered from the classical didactic approach to, by 1985, a student self-directed, experiential learning environment. This entailed shifting from a faculty-perceived narrow agricultural production perspective to one of a multi-discplinary rural development focus. The focus of this systems inquiry is that of a marketer examining a well-established faculty task (function), with the objective of determining how well that task is being performed, and what (if any) remedial action is indicated. The inquiry indicates that there has been a failure to maximise potential in the faculty subsystem that is responsible for communication with concerned publics. The failure is general, in that it was not confined just to communication with employers of faculty outputs. All publics were involved; the faculty's separate messages were not being sensibly delivered to employers, prospective students, undergraduates, academic peers, and government. Analysis of the issues led to the development of a marketing (information) strategy that recognises the need to re-order the faculty's information-formulation and delivery subsystem. A series of proposals is advanced for consideration and debate by the Action Research Team as to which of these several actions should be considered as desirable and feasible for implementation. The estimated costs of implementation of the plan are presented on an item by item basis.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agriculture</field><field name="subject">University of Western Sydney</field><field name="subject">employers</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="subject">Hawkesbury</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">self-directed learning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of constructed wetland systems for wastewater treatment : nitrogen transformation and indicator bacteria removal</field><field name="creator">McKersie, Sue A.</field><field name="description">Increasing demands for improved water quality in receiving waters, effluent reclamation and reuse have prompted wide interest in the use of wetlands for the treatment of wastewater. Over a four year period, domestic sewage effluent was treated using a range of gravel based, subsurface flow constructed wetland systems. Weekly samples at inlet and outlet points were assayed for suspended solids, biological oxygen demand, organic carbon, total kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonium, nitrate/nitrite, phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH and faecal coliform levels. The wetland system received secondary treated effluent for three years and primary settled effluent for one year. The potential of constructed wetland systems for nitrogen removal and potential pathogen reduction was investigated. Nitrogen removal was characterised by estimation of potential nitrification and denitrification rates within the system. Disinfection performance of the wetland system was assessed by enumeration of faecal indicator bacteria in the system influent and effluent, as well as with distance along the length of the system. The removal rate was estimated, considering influent and effluent faecal coliform concentrations as well as system hydraulic retention time and temperature.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">land treatment of wastewater</field><field name="subject">eutrophication</field><field name="subject">waterways</field><field name="subject">sewage treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frog abundance and diversity in urban and non-urban habitats in the upper Blue Mountains (New South Wales)</field><field name="creator">Lane, Alan Gordon</field><field name="description">This study was undertaken between July 24, 2003 and January 16, 2004 to investigate the influence of urban development upon the abundance and species diversity of frogs in the upper Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. Five urban sites were paired with matched non-urban sites. Urban sites were located within or on the fringes of the towns of Katoomba and Blackheath and were subject to varying degrees of physical disturbance, as well as degradation and pollution by urban runoff and sewage. The non-urban sites were located within the Blue Mountains National Park and were effectively un-impacted by human activity. No adequate explanation emerged for the marked difference between the frog assemblages at the two types of habitat. It is speculated that the salts, detergents and other chemicals in urban wastewaters (roadway runoff, yard runoff and sewage) may provide the frogs at urban sites with some level of protection against disease, particularly chytridiomycosis. All indications from this and previous work are that the frog abundance and diversity in non-urban habitats in the upper Blue Mountains of New South Wales are showing the same trends in decline as observed in other montane regions of Australia. Urban habitats are important population reservoirs for the diversity of frog species absent from the non-urban habitats, but are vulnerable to progressive destruction from a variety of human impacts.

However, there is an absence of studies examining their effect. Two studies were undertaken examining the relationship between the structural characteristics of poker machines and player expenditure patterns. The first study examined aggregated player data from over 1000 poker machines. The results suggest that both measures of expenditure utilised, stake size and net profit, are related to structural characteristics. This finding provided a foundation for the theoretical discussion of individual player behaviour encompassing both learning and cognitive paradigms. The second study examined the expenditure patterns of 533 individual players in an ecologically valid setting. The results indicate that player stake size is related to certain structural characteristics but player net loss is not. These results failed to support the predictions of operant conditioning.

The end product showed no visible difference from untreated rice, and the cooked product had a perceivable aroma. The aromatisation process used liquid carbon dioxide as a vehicle to deliver the aroma, and eugenol, isoeugenol, methyl eugenol, cinnamyl alcohol and cinnamaldehyde were used as the principle model aroma components. The aromas penetrated the cores of the rice grains, providing a longer period for the aroma compounds to migrate toward the surface and be lost to the open air. The stability of the injected compounds in aromatised rice was investigated, showing that aroma loss was a first-order process, although some model compounds showed evidence of two binding models, with two distinct phases of aroma loss. The strength of aroma binding to rice was further assessed by means of gas-chromatography columns, and the model aroma compounds interacted best with the rice-flour column. Shelf-life studies demonstrated that eugenol and cinnamaldehyde in aromatised rice showed no significant changes after being stored for 6 months in sealed vacuum aroma-barrier plastic bags, and the aromas could be detected by the human olfactory system after the rice had been cooked by boiling and steaming</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">food odor</field><field name="subject">milled rice</field><field name="subject">fragrant rice</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/478</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative study of production, infectivity, and effectiveness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi produced by soil-based and soil-less techniques</field><field name="creator">Asif, Mohammad</field><field name="description">The present study was firstly aimed at producing the AM fungal inocula by using soil-based and soil-less culture techniques, including the in-vitro axenic technique, and secondly to assess the infectivity and effectiveness of the inocula so produced in glasshouse and field conditions. Indigenous AM fungi from 5 different sites of New South Wales were successfully propagated and multiplied using the pot-culture and atomizing disc aeroponic culture techniques, and their infectivity was measured using the MPN bioassay method. The coarse and fine sand mix was proven to be very effective for the production of AM fungal inocula. The findings indicated that aeroponic culture technique is far superior to that of conventional pot-culture technique, and could possibly substitute the most commonly used pot-culture technique of AM fungal inoculum production. The ultra-sonic nebulizer technology could possibly be an alternative to conventional aeroponic systems for producing AM fungal isolates in commercial quantities. The introduction of the sheared-root inoculum of Glomus intraradices, produced by the ultra-sonic nebulizer technique, into agricultural soils can substantially reduce the intake of P-fertilizers as much as 50% of the recommended level. The study also indicated that soil phosphorus is a critical factor in limiting mycorrhizal colonization, possibly limiting mycorrhizal responses.The research suggests that various commercially produced single or 'cocktail' inocula may work on mycorrhiza dependent plants in soils where the indigenous AM flora is either not abundant and/or efficient.

A close investigation of the social circumstances of individuals and of the relationships between individuals who were caught up in verbal crime provides a detailed context or 'micro-history' of this phenomenon, which in turn sheds light on the socio-economic changes occurring in the Northwest during this period. Since crimes associated with speech increased fourfold between 1580-1680, an investigation of the symbolic domain of speech is important to an understanding of early-modern society. This includes an investigation of chiding, cursing and scolding. In this thesis, the sources of female power in the early-modern community are examined, as well as the dynamics of ill-will behind female verbal crime. Such crimes are researched from manuscripts of proceedings in the local church courts and quarter sessions, which often provide insights into the popular politics of early-modern towns. By examining such texts, we may access a 'micro-history' of gossip that contributes to the debate over such micro-historical questions as gender, social politics and female social space.

This thesis examines these gaps via research carried out in two local councils in New South Wales, namely Wollondilly and Wingecarribee Shire Councils, specifically focusing on their tourism departments. The research reports on the following: how organisation culture is defined and shaped in an organisation; the values of an organisation and how they are disseminated and reinforced on a day-to-day basis; and, the contribution employees make to culture change. Moreover, the thesis will examine the organisational members own definition of culture as a way of examining some of the definitions in the literature. The data for this study comprises interviews, questionnaires, surveys, personal observation and secondary sources. The study demonstrates council staff&#8217;s views on culture, and how culture is defined by, and embedded in, an organisation. Through examining the organisation members&#8217; own views of culture, values and their participation, the thesis aims to contribute to the literature on organisation culture by more closely aligning definitions from the literature with empirical data from case studies of organisations</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organisation culture</field><field name="subject">employee participation</field><field name="subject">dissemination</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of UHT recombined and UHT recombined lactose hydrolysed milk during prolonged storage at different temperatures</field><field name="creator">Mittal, Suraj Bhan</field><field name="description">The physico-chemical, biochemical, nutritional (pH, titratable acidity, viscosity, heat stability, ethanol stability, sedimentation, gelation, reflectance, dissolved oxygen, freezing point, lipolysis, fat separation, phosphatase enzyme activity and available lysine) and sensory aspects of UHT recombined and UHT recombined lactose hydrolysed milk of varying degrees of hydrolysis were studied during 6 months storage at 5 degrees C. and 30 degrees C.

The changes in the contents of titratable acid, pH and total soluble solids of model solutions that contained the principal constituents of pineapple juice (citric acid, citrate salt and sucrose) were investigated. The adsorption of individual acids and changes in composition of juice after a de-acidification process were explored. The adsorbed acids were recovered as solutions by some eluants, and studies on colour development in the recovered solutions carried out. The solutions of adsorbed acids recovered by NaOH from the resin, which had been treated by model solutions, were brown in colour. The brown colour was also found immediately when NaOH was added to the resin treated with pineapple juice but it was not found in the treated juice during acid removal treatment when its pH rose to 10. A greater amount of the dark colour was observed in the desorbed solution from the resin that had been treated with pineapple juice. The use of sulphuric acid, sodium chloride, sodium sulphate, sodium bicarbonate and phosphate buffer solution to desorb the acids from pineapple juice-treated resins reduced the intensity of the colour, measured at pH 3.5, of desorbed acid solutions. The colours of the desorbed solutions were pH dependent. Either solution of sulphuric acid or sodium chloride has a comparable desorbing power to a solution of sodium hydroxide whereas the rest has a lower desorbing power</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">De-acidification</field><field name="subject">pineapple</field><field name="subject">ion-exchange</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A total quality management approach to appropriate clinical laboratory test utilisation in acute myocardial infarction</field><field name="creator">Isouard, Godfrey</field><field name="description">The first goal of this investigation was to undertake a non-equivalent quasi-experimental design to test the effect of a total Quality management (TQM) approach to improve the appropriateness of clinical laboratory test utilisation in the management of early acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The study was conducted at 2 public hospitals in Sydney over a 30 month period, and in 2 stages- pre and post TQM intervention. Using specifically a Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) FOCUS-PDCA model, a multidisciplinary team was empowered to make appropriate changes in order to improve a variety of problem areas that affected the total pathology service. Improvement was directed at the total system of pathology testing, not just test ordering. It was observed that the introduction of a TQM environment had provided a more committed, integrated and motivated clinical care effort towards improving the appropriateness of test ordering. Such team efforts were accompanied by demonstrated customer satisfaction at various aspects of the laboratory service and further benefits to patient care. Patient care benefited greatly from the highly significant changes towards more appropriate timing of blood collections for cardiac enzyme testing. Other improvements included overall improvements to the turnaround time of test results, reductions in specimen delivery delays, more appropriate use of clinical laboratory tests, a streamlined distribution of printed reports and marked improvements in communication between staff involved in the process of test ordering. Of major importance was the finding that CQI strategies resulted in substantial savings of 23.0% of the overall cost of pathology services. Adoption of the TQM approach appears to be a strategy worthy of exploration by laboratory directors and health administrators interested in improving patient care while at the same time reducing expenditure.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">patient care</field><field name="subject">tests</field><field name="subject">TQM</field><field name="subject">AMI</field><field name="subject">myocardial</field><field name="subject">pathology</field><field name="subject">infarction</field><field name="subject">CQI</field><field name="subject">total quality management</field><field name="subject">emergency</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics of tethering cables for a flying electric generator</field><field name="creator">Murthy, Raghuram Ananda</field><field name="description">The dynamics of a tether cable for a flying wind generator, employed to generate electricity by utilising the high velocity jet-stream winds in the troposphere, is analysed. A non-linear mathematical model for the study of the dynamics of the cable is described by a partial differential equation, which is solved analytically without damping. For unsteady and damped states, ordinary differential equations are obtained by adopting a discrete analysis approach, which are solved numerically with the aid of MATLAB software. Solutions are found for a range of lumped masses to represent the cable and each solution is verified against a previous case. Likewise, the result for the three masses is checked against the cable using a single lumped mass. The analysis is extended to seven discrete masses. This research highlights the dynamic behaviour of the cable subjected to wind gusts on the rotors and it also represents an appreciable input to the flying wind generator concept. The dynamic behaviour of the cable is critical for a flying electric generator.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wind power</field><field name="subject">electric generators</field><field name="subject">wind turbines</field><field name="subject">tether cables</field><field name="subject">flying wind generators</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/674</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecosystem resilience and the restoration of damaged plant communities : a discussion focusing on Australian case studies</field><field name="creator">McDonald, M. Christine</field><field name="description">An examination was undertaken of the literature and restoration cases for 4 major Australian vegetation types (sclerophyll; rainforest; grassland; and wetland) to explore the proposition that ecological resilience may govern recovery after anthropogenic damage, and/or provide a fundamental guide and measure of success for ecological restoration. Also, primary data were collected from highly degraded sites (5 sclerophyll, 3 rainforest, and 4 grassy sites) to assess recovery after restoration treatment. These were supplemented with questionnaire data from practitioners working at a wider range of rainforest and sclerophyll sites, and reports from practitioners working on grassland and wetland sites. In all 4 vegetation types, species generally fell into two main groups : longer-lived 'resprouters' and shorter-lived 'obligate seeders'. But different resilience models were identified for the 4 vegetation types. The sclerophyll type exhibited higher in situ resilience but lower migratory resilience than the rainforest type, which was facilitated by flying frugivore dispersal to perch trees. Self-perpetuation was more tightly coupled with disturbance in the sclerophyll, grassland and wetland types than rainforest; and therefore 'designed disturbance' played a more obvious role in enhancing recovery within these types, than in rainforest. Results suggest that resilience (as both an ecosystem property and a theoretical concept) is fundamental to the practice of ecological restoration. Some prediction of resilience potential of particular degraded sites (and prediction of the degree and type of restoration subsidy needed) can be based on knowledge of : individual species' recovery mechanisms; resilience models for individual vegetation-types; and the site's colonisation potential and impact history</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ecosystem</field><field name="subject">resilience</field><field name="subject">sclerophyll</field><field name="subject">grassland</field><field name="subject">regeneration</field><field name="subject">plant species</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/683</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecological importance of carnivory in the genus Utricularia</field><field name="creator">Jobson, Richard W.</field><field name="description">Three species of the carnivorous bladderwort Utricularia (U. uliginosa, U. uniflora and U. gibba) were studied in the field to determine the fauna content or prey, within their bladder-traps.

The portfolio includes a synthesis of the themes that unify the articles and a review of the qualitative research methods that inform the articles, namely theoretical/conceptual and case study research. In relation to literacy curriculum, the portfolio explicates an inclusive and extended definition of literacy which reflects the wide range of social and cultural practices that engage young students in their everyday lives. From a sociocultural perspective, the articles investigate current literacy practices involving spoken, written and visual modes of representation and highlight the prevalence of multimodal texts within the concept of multiliteracies. Reconceptualising literacy pedagogy is another major theme of the articles in the portfolio. The majority of articles explore the use of drama pedagogy for the teaching and learning of literacies in early childhood education. A second pedagogical strategy researched in the articles is the explicit teaching of knowledge about language to young school students. The portfolio is underpinned by the premise that the proposed reforms of literacy curriculum and pedagogy contribute to social justice in education by facilitating success in literacy for more young students</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Literacy</field><field name="subject">Early childhood education</field><field name="subject">pedagogy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A design for better living : the bio-politics of eugenics, diet and childhood in the Hopewood Experiment of L. O. Bailey</field><field name="creator">Ambery, Deborah</field><field name="description">During World War II and the years immediately following, a successful Sydney businessman, Lesley Owen (L.O.) Bailey, initiated a unique social experiment. Bailey formed an organisation, the Youth Welfare Association of Australia (YWAA), which took into its care 86 &#8216;war babies&#8217;, 43 boys and 43 girls, children who were unable, for a number of reasons, to be cared for by their natural parents. For the next 20 years, these children were cared for by Bailey and the YWAA in a number of homes throughout NSW, which he established for the purpose, the primary home being located at Hopewood House, Bowral. The children were raised entirely on a natural diet, primarily fresh vegetables and fruit. Formal medical care was limited, with medical interventions emphasising the preventative properties of the natural health diet, rather than the use of conventional medical cures. The children were subjected to regular medical, and in particular dental, surveillance and measurement, the results of which were formally published in learned medical and dental journals in Australia during the 1950s. Bailey&#8217;s stated intention was to demonstrate the virtues of his regime of diet and health, and the physical improvements which could be derived from his regime. This thesis examines the bio-political dimensions of Bailey&#8217;s project within the context of scientific modernity. Within this context, the project is examined from three major perspectives. First, the project is examined as a eugenics experiment. It is argued that Bailey&#8217;s project was eugenically motivated, with the intention in the first instance of improving the physical being of the generation of children under his control. The second major dimension examines the disciplines of bodily regulation within Hopewood, and in particular the Hopewood diet. Diet is viewed as a mode of social discipline, imposed within the framework of a total institution for purposes of bio-political enhancement of the species being. For Bailey, diet is the mode of regulation which enables the eugenic outcome of trans-generational bodily enhancement. Third, the thesis examines the implications of social contructions of childhood within the bio-political context, in particular, issues of the ownership of children and children&#8217;s bodies. Bailey&#8217;s project was an experiment enacted on the bodies of children, and it is argued that social constructions of childhood, especially the discourses surrounding innocence and socialisation, define social ownership and constrain children&#8217;s social membership. This thesis is an examination of how society views children, what society sees as the role of children, and the kinds of practices which these constructions sanction towards children. It also illuminates an episode in the history of the Australian eugenics movement, and especially the eugenics of diet. This thesis is a record of a unique Australian social experiment, and its impact on a number of individual lives</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">YWAA</field><field name="subject">socialisation</field><field name="subject">parenting</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Images of the urban experience in contemporary painting.</field><field name="creator">Earles, Bruce</field><field name="description">This research entitled Images of the urban experience in contemporary painting began as an investigation into the consequences of urbanism such as human alienation and personal detachment. As a studio based research, this practice was based on five individual exhibitions of contemporary paintings accompanied by four underlying theoretical exegeses. These components together with the involvement in various group exhibitions, awards and professional practice documented in a research portfolio were developed over a three-year period. As each series of paintings was exhibited, new priorities and directions were established. These developments ranged from documentation of the decline in the conscious organisation of urban life images to the utilisation of media and techniques to promote greater fluidity and painting spontaneity. The theme of human alienation in this investigation developed into a focus on the existential predicament of place-bereft individuals. As the nature of location was brought into focus, an exploration of the influence and question of place emerged. This concept gave rise to an investigation into place-panic or human anxiety at the prospect of an unknown place.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">artists and community</field><field name="subject">urban experience</field><field name="subject">contemporary painting</field><field name="subject">human alienation</field><field name="subject">urban life images</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Production of cellulolytic enzymes using immobilised anaerobic fungi</field><field name="creator">McCabe, Bernadette K.</field><field name="description">An investigation was made into the isolation and screening of highly cellulolytic anaerobic fungi and their production of cellulolytic enzymes using immobilised rhizomycelia. A total of 46 anaerobic fungi were isolated on cellulosic substrates from ruminant and non-ruminant herbivores. Primary screening of these isolates was performed using dye release from cellulose-azure which qualitatively detected cellulolytic activity. Twelve isolates were chosen on the basis of their maximum solubilisation rates of the labelled cellulose and then subjected to secondary screening which involved the quantification of enzyme activity. The enzyme mixtures were characterised by carboxymethylcellulase, xylanase, B-glucosidase, B-xylosidase and cellobiase assays, measured by the production of either reducing sugars, p-nitrophenol or glucose. All strains produced a number of enzymes that allowed them to hydrolyse straw and highest enzyme activity was measured in static cultures grown on 0.5% straw. A monocentric isolate, Piromyces strain KSX1 from a red kangaroo, and a cattle polycentric isolate, Orpinomyces strain 478P1, were selected for study of cellulolytic enzyme production on the basis of high fibre digestion capability and amenability toward encapsulation. The immobilised polycentric strain proved to be operationally superior to strain KSX1 as strain 478P1 did not produce any viable growth in the culture liquor. Studies into single batch cultures of free cells of strains KSX1 and 478P1 revealed that the maximum specific rate of B-glucosidase production occurred concomitantly with maximum specific growth rate suggesting that the immobilised fungus must grow for continuous enzyme production to occur. Although the physiology of cellulase synthesis in strains KSX1 and 478P1 was found to be growth-associated, immobilisation of the fungus offered the advantage of the repeat-batch use of cells with the accumulation of extracellular enzymes after each batch. Thus, operational gains were the key issues in assessing the potential application of immobilised anaerobic fungi in the production of cellulolytic enzymes. The repeat-batch system was operationally more efficient than the free cell batch cultures because immobilisation removed the need of reculturing the cells for every single batch.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anaerobic fungi</field><field name="subject">enzymes</field><field name="subject">cellulose</field><field name="subject">cellulase</field><field name="subject">repeat-batch</field><field name="subject">cultivation</field><field name="subject">immobilise</field><field name="subject">isolates</field><field name="subject">substrates</field><field name="subject">cells</field><field name="subject">biomass</field><field name="subject">B-glucosidase</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">liquor</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/83</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From the change without to the change within : a group dynamic approach to action research</field><field name="creator">Williams, Ken</field><field name="description">This thesis details an action research project conducted into the theme of 'improving the functioning of a Faculty of Agriculture'. The Faculty had been changing to an experiential paradigm of learning over a period of ten years when the research began. The initial impetus for the research was a feeling of concern by many members of the Faculty about the impacts of this change. A research team of six members, which met regularly for 12 months, was organised. The research began with the assumption 'that an Action Research team can intervene in the life of an organisation for the benefit of that organisation, to bring about situation improvement'. There was an initial expectation that issues of accountability, responsibility and management within the Faculty, would be the focus of the research team. However, during the course of the research, the personal professional practice of the researchers became the focus. Analysis of the data highlighted a link between the technical, practical and emancipatory modes of Action Research, and the four stages of group development - dependency, conflict, cohesion and interdependency. The role of facilitation in the conduct of Action Research was highlighted, and the nature of the 'client' role was subjected to scrutiny. The wider ramifications of this research are discussed, particularly as they relate to the role of Action Research in improving large organisations, and as a tool to improve farming communities. In both cases, the concept of the 'critical community' was emphasised as an ideal to be aimed for in Action Research teams. To achieve such a group, the belief systems of members need to be brought out, to enable a group to develop in its interactions to a stage where issues can be properly dealt with, rather than only the assumed symptoms of underlying issues. A process of critique and reflection in an immediate and ongoing way has been shown to assist in this process of group development towards a critical community</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Action research</field><field name="subject">agriculture</field><field name="subject">leader</field><field name="subject">conflict</field><field name="subject">cohesion</field><field name="subject">reflection</field><field name="subject">dependency</field><field name="subject">critique</field><field name="subject">faculty</field><field name="subject">group</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">facilitator</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/88</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The demoniacal impulse : the construction of amok in the Philippines</field><field name="creator">Ugarte, Eduardo F.</field><field name="description">In the Philippines, amok is often viewed as a form of homicidal behaviour to which Muslim Filipino or Moro men are prone. Various assumptions about contemporary Filipino perceptions of amok are challenged in this thesis. It is assumed that this perception corresponds with the actual occurrence of amok in the Philippines, and this is challenged by the demonstration that the perception is merely a construct. The perception of amok is assumed to be the culmination of attempts by Spaniards, Americans and Filipinos to discern the true nature of amok, and this is challenged by the fact that discrepancies exist between recognition of amok by the Spanish on one hand and the Americans and Christian Filipinos on the other. It is argued that contemporary Filipino understanding of amok is the product of two factors: the American drive to acquire information about Filipinos that would enable them to control their newly acquired subjects, and the conflict between Americans and Filipinos generated by this attempt at control. The association of amok with Muslim Filipinos is the outcome of the mistaken conflation of amok with the juramentado convention of the Moros, and the idea that the Muslim Filipinos were the most Malay of the Malay &#8216;subraces&#8217; in the Philippines and thus most likely to run amok.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">amok</field><field name="subject">homicide</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Muslims</field><field name="subject">men</field><field name="subject">psychoses</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/39353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theatre of light - living images in shadows and light</field><field name="creator">Spiteri, Michael, Richard</field><field name="description">How the artist deals with death, loss and the spiritual has been a major theme of art throughout history.

In so doing, this has the potential to uncover any revealing insights that are relevant to the times.      The project uses myth to explore the potential of the interaction between 2D digital images and 3D virtual environments. Elements of particular significance in the 3D virtual environment - such as Lighting and Point of View - are examined from the perspective of an artist who has practised only in 2D. Twelve final works have been generated for this project and presented as large-scale digital prints, along with a short video piece.      In particular, the research explores 3D lighting techniques of 2D images by applying theatrical protocols within a virtual, computer-generated environment, and using myth as context and driving principle. The idea of theatre 'flats' has been applied as a device within the virtual realm to provide a conceptual housing and rationale for virtual lighting techniques, virtual camera techniques, digital rendering and digital printing.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">death</field><field name="subject">loss</field><field name="subject">spiritual</field><field name="subject">myth</field><field name="subject">tools</field><field name="subject">creative media</field><field name="subject">3D</field><field name="subject">virtual environment Lighting</field><field name="subject">Point of View</field><field name="subject">flats</field><field name="subject">print</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090709.140613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capabilities-strategy match and Board governance: Their impacts on Financial Performance and Accountability-Emphasis of Government Business Enterprises</field><field name="creator">Seng, Cheaseth</field><field name="description">The study addresses three research questions posed by the nature of government business enterprises. The three questions are (1) Does the way management (including the board) aligns the development of GBE organisational capabilities and the formulation of strategies have an influence on the financial performance and management's emphasis for discharging accountability requirements of that GBE? (2)  Does the extent of adoption of board governance structures have an influence on financial performance and accountability-emphasis given by management of a GBE? (3) Does board composition moderate the relationship between capabilities-strategy configurations and performance of a GBE?       The research questions are addressed as follow. First, the study explores the concepts of corporate governance, board governance in particular, strategy, capabilities and accountability in the context of GBEs. Second, the study investigates relationships between GBEs' governance arrangements and performance, on the one hand, and capabilities-strategy match and performance on the other hand. The concept of performance used in this study is separated into financial performance, measured by economic rate of return (ERR) (a government-developed algorithm for GBEs comprising financial accounting and market measures), and accountability-emphasis (ACCBTY) (management's attention to systems and processes used for discharging aspects of accountability). Third, the study investigates the moderating effects of GBEs' board governance arrangements on the relationship between capabilities-strategy match and performance.       The findings of the study are as follow. First, the results of a set of multivariate analyses indicate that board governance index (BGI) has a positive and significant relationship with ERR, but has no significant relationship with ACCBTY. At the individual governance mechanism level, the percentages of non-executive directors (NEDs), politically-related directors (PRDs) and financial-literate directors (FLDs) are all strongly and positively related to ERR. These findings are supported by certain prior studies from different contexts. On the ACCBTY side, these specific board governance variables are not found to support a hypothesis that the composition of the board will impact on the GBE's attention to accountability processes.        Second, the findings indicate that capabilities-strategy match (CSM) has no significant influence on ERR but has a strong and positive impact on ACCBTY. The results indicate that only the alignment between defender strategic-type and outside-in capabilities has a positive relationship with both ERR and ACCBTY.  Other than the defender strategic position, alternative strategy-types will align with capabilities (e.g. prospector strategy and inside-out capabilities) to have a significant positive affect on ACCBTY, but not on ERR.    Third, the study finds that GBE's board governance arrangements (BGI) have a positive moderating affect on the relationship between capabilities-strategy match and ERR. However, BGI has no moderating impact on capabilities-strategy match and ACCBTY relationship.        The findings draw the conclusion that in order to achieve their dual objectives of concurrently fulfilling financial performance and accountability-emphasis, GBEs need to adopt a defender strategic-type, develop strengths in outside-in capabilities and have their boards of directors comprise of non-executive directors, politically-linked directors and financial-literate directors. Given the limitations underlying the findings that are mentioned, the conclusion from this study has implications for government-owners and managers of GBE.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Board Governance</field><field name="subject">Capabilities-Strategy Match</field><field name="subject">Government Business Enterprises</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090709.155517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Talking pictures: a creative utilization of structural and aesthetic profiles from narrative music videos and television commercials in a non-spoken film text</field><field name="creator">Ings, Welby</field><field name="description">This thesis is about storytelling. It is presented in three parts, a major output with two supporting components. The first and primary section is the short film. The second is an exhibition of images, props, and environments created for the work. The third is the exegesis. Situated as creative practice, the project tests and develops structural and aesthetic hypotheses in the creation of a non-spoken film text. These hypotheses are shaped by considerations from two areas.The first is design for narrative music video. An analysis of selected texts leads to a creative reconsideration of the role and profile of imagery, space, time, sound, enigma, closure, and narrative voice. The second area is typography. Reflecting on the anti-language, bogspeak, and the culture that has given rise to its development, the thesis develops inaudible typographical voices that operate as narrative contributions to the film.These two areas of consideration support a unique way of telling stories. This is significant because emerging uses of short film now take these texts beyond the theatre. They are marketed as commercially available stories in their own right. As distribution companies are formatting them on DVDs, viewers are seeing these stories not once, but many times. It is useful therefore, for the design of such texts to consider alternative methods of narration that might work to preserve the durability and complexity of their stories as they unravel over repeated screenings.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Storytelling</field><field name="subject">Graphic arts</field><field name="subject">Short films</field><field name="subject">Homosexuality, Male</field><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological response to sport-specific aerobic interval training in high school male basketball players</field><field name="creator">Stone, Nick</field><field name="description">It has been shown that a high level of aerobic fitness is important for athletes participating in intermittent (team) sports. The majority of studies investigating the effects of traditional and sport-specific aerobic interval exercise on physiological measures and performance have involved field-based team sports. In some instances the effectiveness of sport-specific aerobic training has been questioned. To date, no study has investigated the influence of a sport-specific training approach in the sport of basketball. Purpose: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a basketball specific endurance circuit on improving measures of aerobic fitness. Methods: Ten male high school basketball players, age 16.4 &#177; 1.2 years, ranked by fitness level and randomly assigned to a training group (N = 6) or control group (N = 4) participated in the study. The sport-specific aerobic endurance training replaced the fitness component of regular training and was performed during the competitive season. The sport-specific training consisted of interval training using a basketball specific endurance circuit, four times 4 min at 90-95% HRpeak with a 3 min recovery at 60-70% HRpeak, twice per week for 6 weeks. During this time the control group performed regular basketball training. Results: For both the training and control groups the actual mean training intensity for total training duration were 77.4 &#177; 2.9% HRpeak and 74.1 &#177; 6.7% HRpeak, respectively. The actual mean training intensity during the work intervals in the training group was 84.1 &#177; 2.3% HRpeak. There were no clear differences between effects of the two training approaches for measures of maximal oxygen uptake (3.3%; 90% confidence limits, &#177; 19.3%), running economy (-3.3%; 90% confidence limits, &#177; 14.2%), repeated sprint ability (0.6%; 90% confidence limits, &#177; 5.7%) and anaerobic power maintenance during the repeated sprints (-13.7%; 90% confidence limits, &#177; 49.0%). However, a clear non-trivial effect on sub-maximal heart rate was observed (-7.3%; 90% confidence limits, &#177; 2.0%) suggesting a beneficial training effect after training. Some evidence for attenuation of speed (-1.8 to -2.8%; 90% confidence limits, &#177; 3.4 to 5.7%) and power (-1.7%; 90% confidence limits, &#177; 17.1%) was apparent. Conclusion: Although clear changes in sub-maximal HR responses were observed in the training group, the data in the present study suggests that a basketball specific endurance circuit has little effect on other laboratory and field-based measures of aerobic fitness. In fact, the basketball specific endurance circuit may lead to reduced improvements in jumping and sprinting performances.  Further research is required to clarify the effect of aerobic training approaches on basketball-specific fitness and performance.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aerobic</field><field name="subject">interval training</field><field name="subject">sport-specific</field><field name="subject">running economy</field><field name="subject">repeated sprint ability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuromuscular fatigue in people with chronic stroke</field><field name="creator">Signal, Nada E.

The central research question it aims to answer is: 'How can the public guard against manipulation of opinion?' The articles are accompanied by an exegesis which explains the research process and the role of important sources in the project. The research draws on relevant literature as well as interviews with people involved in public relations, journalism and academia.The first article Public Relations &amp; Democratic Society looks at the various definitions of public relations and examines the debate over whether PR operates in the public interest. Article two, The Production of News, discusses the interface of public relations and journalism and also deals with the economic considerations affecting mass media outlets. PR Under the Spotlight in New Zealand, the third article, is a case study of a public relations campaign mounted by state-owned logging company Timberlands West Coast Ltd. The final article Navigating the Information Environment examines the current state of the interface between PR and journalism in New Zealand and sets out suggestions for how members of the public can avoid being manipulated.The research found that in order to prevent manipulation it is up to members of the public to actively seek truth and not uncritically accept information received through the media. Due to the work of the public relations industry and the media there are many ways in which information can be filtered and massaged and it is knowledge of these processes that puts the public in the best position to see reality.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Propaganda</field><field name="subject">Press and propaganda</field><field name="subject">Mass media - Political aspects</field><field name="subject">Journalism - Objectivity</field><field name="subject">Public opinion</field><field name="subject">Public relations</field><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/265</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Uncovering strategic entrepreneurship: an examination of theory and practice</field><field name="creator">Luke, Belinda</field><field name="description">The combination of entrepreneurship and strategy is gaining increasing recognition as a pathway for growth within both individual organisations and national economies. Hence the benefits emerge from both a micro and macro economic perspective. Essentially, however, research on strategic entrepreneurship, being the intersection of entrepreneurship and strategy remains in the early stages. While the benefits of combining entrepreneurship and strategy are well established, specific details and underlying elements of strategic entrepreneurship as a concept remain under-developed and unsubstantiated. Prevailing models of strategic entrepreneurship are limited in number, conceptual in nature, and do not yet have practical or empirical support. Thus the question arises as to what constitutes strategic entrepreneurship?In order to address this issue a preliminary framework of strategic entrepreneurship is derived from the literature on both entrepreneurship and strategy, in order to identify the intersection of the two. This framework is then examined in the context of activity which is recognised as both entrepreneurial and strategic within three state-owned enterprises. Thus the research question addressed is:What constitutes strategic entrepreneurship in both theory and practice in the context of SOEs?Based on this examination, six elements are identified as central to strategic entrepreneurship, being opportunity identification, innovation, acceptance of risk, flexibility, vision, and growth. Additional findings uncovered inductively from the data reveal a number of supporting elements which foster strategic entrepreneurship, including strategy, culture (encompassing both people and confidence), branding, operational excellence, cost efficiency, and transfer and application of knowledge.Thus, an enhanced understanding of strategic entrepreneurship as a concept is obtained, being activity which is both entrepreneurial and strategic in nature, and characterised by the integration of the six core elements. Findings indicate strategic entrepreneurship is a concept not bound by context, and thus, may be applied to various forms of business. Such businesses which do create strategic entrepreneurship activity and are able to maintain a balance of the core elements over time have the potential for both competitive advantage and wealth creation.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">Case studies</field><field name="subject">Strategic planning</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shifting focus: how registered nurses in residential aged care organise their work: a grounded theory study</field><field name="creator">McKenzie-Green, Barbara A</field><field name="description">Registered nurses in residential aged care work with older people who have complex care needs. Besides providing direct care, these nurses have a wide range of responsibilities which include supervising staff and attending to the smooth running of the care facility. This grounded theory study using dimensional analysis was aimed at answering the question: How do registered nurses organise their work? Indepth interviews were conducted with 10 registered nurses who worked in a range of positions in aged care facilities. Theoretical sampling and constant comparative analysis was used to guide both ongoing data collectiona and data analysis. Categories were examined for their relationships and dimensions to arrive at a substantive grounded theory which I have named 'shifting focus'. Individual and institutional philosophies of care were core elements in the registered nurses' focus of work. There was a relationship between staffing adequacy, individual and institutional philosophies of care, and the focus of registered nurse work. These relationships created conditions where the registered nurse would focus on ensuring the delivery of individualised resident care or focus on getting through the routine of care. The relationship between staffing adequacy, philosophies of care and the registered nurses' focus of work remained consistent when staffing adequacy changed. In instances of decreased staffing adequacy, the participants' focus shifted to either maintaining individualised care or focusing on safety. When the registered nurse aimed to change the philosophy of care, an increase in staffing adequacy enabled some aspects of cultural change to commence. The relationships between residents, family and staff were significant contrasting elements within an individualised philosophy of care, and an institutional philosophy of care. In the former, relationships were valued and developed. In the latter, they were benevolent, functional or conflicted. The significance of this study is that it reveals how registered nurses and management personnel in aged care facilities, can create conditions where the relationships between residents, their families and staff, are valued and developed to result in positive care outcomes. It is recommended that future research be conducted to examine the resources required to maintain an individualised approach to the nursing care of residents in aged care facilities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Older people</field><field name="subject">Care</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="subject">Practice</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Otago exercise programme: do strength and balance improve?</field><field name="creator">Binns, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of participation in the Otago Exercise Programme (OEP) on strength and balance.

Participants' fear of falling was measured with the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale and falls were monitored using a falls diary.Results: There were no statistically significant improvements in strength and balance in the OEP group and no statistically significant differences between the OEP and control group, after participating in the OEP for 6 months. The only statistically significant change in the OEP group was a slowing of gait velocity, all other outcome measures remained unchanged for both the OEP group and the control group.Conclusions: There were no statistically significant improvements in strength and balance after participating in the OEP. These results are consistent with those of the original Otago trial and the subsequent meta-analysis of all the Otago trials. The results from this study need to be interpreted with caution, as due to the small sample size the study was underpowered.

The research presented here considers the mutualistic roles of exotic and indigenous species in the process of restoring degraded landscapes. Exotic species may have an important role in the (re) establishment of desired indigenous species, and may influence succession through to a forest dominated by them. One aspect of this work describes indigenous plant community regeneration facilitated by exotic willow (Salix spp.) woodland on the Canterbury Plain. Natural colonisation of the willow woodland by native plants was investigated, with respect to variation in the physical environment in the willow stand. Key factors in the success of willow woodland as a nursery for regeneration of native vegetation include: distance to the nearest seed source, the ability to attract seed dispersers (recruitment only occurred under perch sites), flooding potential (higher recruitment in areas less likely to flood) and possibly light availability. Control of vertebrate (and invertebrate) herbivory is also necessary for successful restoration. A second aspect was a field experiment in open pasture and in a non-native remnant woodland which was then used to investigate the effects of shelter, plant spacing, mulching and fertiliser on growth and survival of planted native woody species. With minimal management, the selected mid-late successional plants established poorly in the open pasture and had low survival rates (e.g.,Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, Pseudopanax arboreus, Aristotelia serrata, Melicytus ramiflorus). Only narrow-leaved species (e.g., Plagianthus reg ius, Hoheria angustifolia, Hebe salicifolia, Cordyline australis) survived this open pasture planting. In contrast, most species (broad and narrow-leaved) established under the sheltered sites. Exotic nursery vegetation and the establishment of native species, which will, in time, act as a seed source, will be important in successfully restoring a sustainable indigenous element in the cultural landscape of Canterbury. Ecological restoration requires an integrated approach, identifying and understanding the component processes of regeneration, and of the particular aspects/characteristics of the sites involved. This research shows that naturally established plants where existing shelter is available (in this case established willows) tend to have higher growth rates than individually planted plants in open situations, and that the availability of a suitable seed source can also contribute to successful establishment and growth rates. The meeting of restoration targets on the Canterbury Plain may be accelerated, and costs reduced, through the utilisation of areas where exotic species occur (for instance, extensive willow stands in riparian areas adjacent to waterways) and more particularly, where a local seed source is also available. The findings of this research can contribute to restoration management in helping identify the best practices, based on research, that can lead to the restoration of original plant and animal communities.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">restoration</field><field name="subject">indigenous species</field><field name="subject">Canterbury</field><field name="subject">forest succession</field><field name="subject">Salix cinerea</field><field name="subject">ecological restoration</field><field name="subject">regeneration</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300801 Environmental management and rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of the sources of competitive advantage in the New Zealand and Uruguayan beef industries</field><field name="creator">Serra Postiglione, Virginia</field><field name="description">According to Porter (1990), there are certain characteristics of a country that allow its industries to create and sustain competitive advantage, or prevent them from doing so. The objective of this study was to identify and compare the sources of competitive advantage or disadvantage for the Uruguayan and New Zealand beef industries. To accomplish these objectives, Porter&#8217;s Diamond Framework was selected as the theoretical framework to assess the competitive advantage of nations. Two case studies &#8220;the Beef Industry in Uruguay&#8221; and &#8220;the Beef Industry in New Zealand&#8221; were carried out. The information was obtained from secondary sources and open-ended interviews to key informants in both countries. Uruguay and New Zealand possess observable similarities, such as size, population, similar farmland area, and an economy based on agriculture with low levels of subsidies and trade regulations. In addition, the industries in both countries target the international market. Considering beef production, these countries produce beef based on pastures; hence, they have similar seasonal fluctuations in slaughter and in the product offered into the market. These similarities make these countries interesting to compare. On the other hand, Uruguay and New Zealand have differences. They are in different stages of economic development, and have cultural, sociological and educational differences. The beef industry is the most important economic activity in Uruguay, as can be illustrated by the resources allocated in this sector and in the volume and value of exported beef. In New Zealand, the beef industry is less important; however, it constitutes an excellent complementary activity for sheep and dairy productions. Both beef industries also have differences in their levels of productivity, stock compositions, stock categories, age of slaughtered animals, sanitary status, and locations in relation to markets. This suggests different sources of competitive advantage. The results show that the Uruguayan beef industry has a weaker diamond than its New Zealand counterpart does. However, the industry in Uruguay has been increasing the use of resources in comparison to other pastoral activities such as dairy and sheep. In contrast, the New Zealand beef industry, despite having a stronger diamond than the Uruguayan beef industry, has a secondary role behind the sheep and dairy industry. There are two clear limitations for the Uruguayan beef industry. First, the performance of the primary sector is poor. Second, the Uruguayan exported beef receives a lower price than the New Zealand product, and has difficulties for gaining access to certain markets. These two characteristics were identified as the most dissimilar for both industries. The selected research design and theoretical framework were adequate to accomplish the objectives. Although most of Porter&#8217;s findings were not supported in this study, using the framework allowed the development of an exhaustive analysis of the possible factors affecting the sources of competitive advantage in both industries. Comparing diamonds in different countries has not been done before; therefore, this research provides empirical evidence of the advantages and disadvantages of using this framework for international comparisons. Finally, the information presented in this research did not intend to suggest possible strategies or policies to increase the competitiveness of both industries. However, the results are likely to provide useful information for further studies in these industries.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">competitive advantage</field><field name="subject">Porter's Diamond</field><field name="subject">beef industry</field><field name="subject">Uruguay</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340201 Agricultural economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insects associated with the lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) cultivars Fest and Uniharvest</field><field name="creator">Harris, B.

The main sampling methods were sweepnetting, use of the D-Vac, and pod removal. Glasshouse experiments were carried out with species showing pest potential (based on the survey). These species were Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), Nysius huttoni White, and Sidnia kinbergi (Stalenberg). While A. pisum and S. kinbergi had their pest potential confirmed, N. huttoni did not. Although the aphids Acyrthosiphon kondoi Shinji, Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thompson) and Myzus persicae (Sulzer) were not studied in the laboratory, field data indicated their pest potential. Insects to show lesser pest potential were Calocoris norvegicus (Gmelin), Hylemyia deceptiva Malloch, and Hylemyia platura (Meigen). Important potential predators or parasites were Austromicromus tasmaniae (Walker), Coccinella undecimpunctata L., Tropiconabis capsiformis (Germar), some Araneae species and single unidentified species of Braconidae and Eulophidae. The cultivar Uniharvest was the preferred host presumably because it does not possess the toxic alkaloids of Fest.

Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The prevalence of Salmonella and the spatial distribution of its serovars amongst New Zealand's native lizards : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Zoology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Middleton, Danielle Mary Rose Lea</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the prevalence and spatial distribution of Salmonella serovars amongst wild endemic lizards on offshore islands around the coast of New Zealand. The mean test prevalence of faecal excretion of Salmonella was 4.7%. Skinks (Scincidae) were more likely (8.5%) to be carriers of Salmonella than geckos (1.6%). Each island was host to between one and three Salmonella serovars that were not found on any other islands in this study. Two exceptions were Salmonella Bousso and Salmonella Mana which were found on two islands within the same geographical area. Based on the findings of this study, different islands are likely to be hosts to different Salmonella serovars which could have implications for future translocations of native lizards. I also assessed the prevalence and spatial distribution of faecal excretion of Salmonella, Aeromonas and Hafnia alvei within Mana Island. The prevalence of Salmonella on Mana Island was estimated at 5.8%. Salmonella was found predominantly in skinks (10.0%) and less often in geckos (4.1%). H. alvei was found at a prevalence of 1.9%. No Aeromonas species were cultured from any of the cloacal swabs, suggesting that the 95% confidence interval for the true prevalence is 0-3%. Each site sampled in this study was host to one or more unique serovar of Salmonella not found at any of the other sites. The results of this study indicate that Salmonella serovars may become established within populations of lizards and is not spread between them. This may be due to a lack of dispersal of lizards between sites, raising important considerations for the translocation of native lizards. I investigated the prevalence of faecal excretion of Salmonella, H. alvei and Aeromonas by New Zealand native lizards from two captive populations. The mean prevalence of faecal excretion of Salmonella in the captive lizards sampled was 11.5%. There was a higher prevalence of Salmonella within captive population A (22.0%) than in population B (3.6%). No Aeromonas was cultured from any of the lizards. H. alvei was found at a prevalence of 5.2%. The prevalence of Salmonella and H. alvei was significantly higher in captive lizards than in wild populations. Captive lizards may, therefore, not be appropriate founders for new populations of wild lizards. Finally I assessed the different efficiencies of two media and two temperatures in isolating six Salmonella serovars from a reptilian source. All serovars grew equally well at 37&#176;C and 27&#176;C. For most serovars XLD agar was the more successful media than MacConkey agar but the success of different culture media depended on the serovar being cultured. Because lizards are frequently host to a wide range of Salmonella serovars, screening samples using multiple microbiological methods is likely to give the best chance of isolating all Salmonella serovars present.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">skinks</field><field name="subject">geckos</field><field name="subject">captive populations</field><field name="subject">Mana Island</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270503 Animal anatomy and histology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of neurostimulation via a suprachoroidal vision prosthesis</field><field name="creator">Wong, Yan Tat, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Microelectronic vision prostheses aim to restore visual percepts through electrical stimulation of the surviving visual pathways in the blind. Electrical stimulation has been shown to produce spots of light in the visual field. A neurostimulator that forms the basis of a vision prosthesis was designed using a high voltage CMOS process to allow it to be able to stimulate when faced with high electrode-tissue impedances. It was implemented with novel features that allow it to be scalable, and to focus charge injection, and can stimulate multiple sites simultaneously using a current source and sink at each site. To reduce electrical cross-talk between multiple stimulation sites, six-return electrodes surround each stimulating electrode, electrically guarding them from each other. The six-return electrode configuration was shown to reduce electrical cross-talk in saline bath tests compared to single-return electrode configurations.  The neurostimulator was used to evoke responses from cats through electrical stimulation via intravitreal ball electrodes, corneal electrodes, and planar electrode arrays in the suprachoroidal space. Responses were measured on the visual cortex through optical imaging of intrinsic signals, and through surface electrodes. Using the planar electrode array in the suprachoroidal space, responses were elicited to biphasic, bipolar and monopolar stimuli, with each stimulating electrode coupled with either six-return electrodes, two-return electrodes, or a single-return electrode. The average charge threshold to elicit a response for biphasic, bipolar stimulation with six-return electrodes was 76.47 ?? 8.76 nC (standard error of the mean). For biphasic, bipolar stimulation, the magnitude and area of cortical response with the six-return electrode configurations was on average 2.18 ?? 0.19 times smaller than single-return electrode configurations, and 1.89 ?? 0.19 times smaller than two-return electrode configurations (P &lt; 0.0001). It was also found that for biphasic stimulation, a greater magnitude and area of response was elicited for monopolar stimulation compared to bipolar stimulation. This dissertation details the design and testing of a novel, scalable neurostimulator to focus charge injection. It also shows that suprachoroidal, bipolar stimulation can elicit visual responses, and that the area of cortical activation was more focused when using bipolar, biphasic stimulation, and six-return electrodes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Suprachoroidal stimulation</field><field name="subject">Vision prosthesis</field><field name="subject">Optical imaging</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autobiographical memory in complicated grief</field><field name="creator">Maccallum, Fiona Louise, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Complicated Grief (CG) has been identified as a potential consequence of bereavement that is associated with unique and debilitating outcomes.  This thesis investigated autobiographical memory in CG.  This program of research focused on the specificity and content of autobiographical memories in the context of CG.  Study 1 investigated memory retrieval specificity using a cue word paradigm.  Bereaved individuals with CG displayed an overgeneral retrieval style (OGM) compared to bereaved individuals without CG.  Study 2 found that CG participants were also less specific in imagining future events in response to positive cues.  Further, there was a significant independent relationship between memory retrieval specificity and the specificity of future imaginings.  Study 3 investigated the relationship between overgeneral memory and social problem solving.  CG participants performed more poorly on this task; however, there was no independent relationship with memory retrieval style.  Study 4 investigated the impact of treatment on OGM.  Results indicated that as symptoms of CG reduced following treatment, individuals retrieved more specific memories to positive cues.  Studies 5-7 examined proposed relationships between self construct and autobiographical remembering in CG, as outlined in Conway and Pleydell-Pearce??s (2000) self memory system model.  In Study 5, individuals with CG were more likely than bereaved controls to view their self-identity as being related to the deceased.  Study 6 investigated the relationship between self-discrepancy, personal goals and memory content.  CG individuals were more likely to recall loss-related memories, and there was a relationship between personal goals and memory content.  Study 7 extended examination of these factors to future-related thinking.  Finally, the program recognised the importance of investigating the impact of the cognitive strategies that individuals may adopt to manage painful memories.  Using an experimental Stroop procedure as a measure of thought accessibility, Study 8 investigated thought suppression in CG.  The results suggested that CG individuals experienced greater interference from death-related cues.  In summary, these studies highlighted some of the key memory processes that may be involved in the maintenance, and potentially the resolution, of CG.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">self</field><field name="subject">autobiographical memory</field><field name="subject">complicated grief</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mutated in colorectal cancer (MCC): a putative tumour suppressor gene in colorectal cancer</field><field name="creator">Sigglekow, Nicholas David, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant burden in contemporary society due to an aging population, unhealthy dietary choices and an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. While the underlying defects for many hereditary forms of CRC have been determined, many genetic and epigenetic changes promoting common sporadic CRCs have yet to be identified. The Mutated in Colorectal Cancer (MCC) gene, identified in 1991, was initially thought to be responsible for the hereditary form of CRC, familial adenomatous polyposis, before the discovery of the susceptibility gene Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC), which then became the focus of intense research. Recent data, however, suggests that MCC may also be important in the development of CRC. I have investigated the mechanism of MCC gene silencing, the putative structure, and multiple functions of MCC.  MCC was frequently silenced by promoter hypermethylation in CRC cell lines and primary tumours. MCC methylation showed strong molecular and clinicopathological associations with hallmarks of the serrated neoplasia pathway. Furthermore, MCC methylation was more frequent in serrated precursor lesions compared with adenomas, thus occurring early during carcinogenesis.  MCC is highly conserved in complex multicellular organisms. Re-introduction of MCC in CRC cell lines resulted in partial G1 to S phase, and G2/M phase cell cycle blocks, potentially by upregulating cell cycle inhibitor gene transcription and interfering with the process of mitotic checkpoints and division, respectively. Changes in MCC levels also modulated NF?B pathway signalling, the pathway required for maintaining cell viability and proliferation in colonic epithelial cells. In particular, MCC overexpression suppressed both TNF? and LPS-induced NF?B activation, decreasing both the magnitude and rate of cellular responses. Overexpression also resulted in downregulation of proteins involved in canonical NF?B pathway signalling, while increasing the transcription of non-canonical NF?B genes. Therefore, MCC may direct activation of this pathway to a specific subset of NF?B-regulated genes. These data provide a molecular basis for the role of MCC as a tumour suppressor gene in CRC. MCC may have multiple functions, regulating cell cycle progression and modulating NF?B pathway signalling, either through direct involvement in pathway signalling cascades, or by providing a scaffold on which signalling events can occur.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tumour suppressor.</field><field name="subject">Mutated in colorectal cancer.</field><field name="subject">MCC.</field><field name="subject">Promoter hypermethylation.</field><field name="subject">Colon cancer.</field><field name="subject">NF-kappaB.</field><field name="subject">Cell cycle.</field><field name="subject">G1/S block.</field><field name="subject">G2/M block.</field><field name="subject">Serrated neoplasia pathway.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insurer risk management and optimal reinsurance</field><field name="creator">Krvavych, Yuriy, Actuarial Studies, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In finance the existence of corporate risk management is due to imperfections in financial markets. One of the main imperfections is associated with the cost of corporate risk that firms assume. Costly corporate risk creates a set of frictional costs and thereby decreases corporate value. Financial corporations manage their risk to reduce the expected value of frictional costs and enhance shareholders' value, and do so using a wide variety of tools. This dissertation primarily considers an insurance company as a special type of financial corporation leveraged by risky debt, and investigates the existence of risk management incentives in insurance in the presence of frictional costs such as financial distress costs and costs caused by the convexity of the corporate tax rate. Here one of the main tool of risk hedging is reinsurance, a classical tool for risk transfer in insurance, and this dissertation investigates demand for reinsurance in insurer value creation. Insurer risk management problems are also investigated here in a dynamic setting, where the main objective is to find optimal reinsurance and dividend payments under which the expected present value of future dividends is maximised. This dissertation also generalizes some classic actuarial results of reinsurance optimization under the mean-variance criterion. In this work optimal reinsurance is found endogenously for different reinsurance premium principle using standard methods of convex analysis. Finally this work considers an integrated market consisting of insureds, insurers and reinsurers, and studies the effect of the presence of reinsurance in this market on insurance price.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reinsurance</field><field name="subject">Risk management.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interpersonal Meaning in Textbooks for Teaching English as a Foreign Language in China: A Multimodal Approach</field><field name="creator">Chen, Yumin</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interpersonal meaning, multimodal discourse analysis, social semiotics,</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading the other: narrative constructions of Japan in the Australian and Chinese press</field><field name="creator">Sun, Wanning</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with the way in which discourses of the Other are deployed in the media's narrative constructions of national imaginary.

The analysis finds that othering is a dynamic and complex process engaged in by both the East and the West, for purposes of both cultural domination and cultural negotiation, and to serve both external and domestic political ends. The study shows that what seems to be an essential distinction between the Orient, or the East, and the Occident, or the West, in the discourses of the Other is constantly shifting, fluid and context-specific.

This is an extraordinary example of 'the written curriculum' of subject English, a site of intense ideological and pedagogical contestation. The Report produced by the Eltis Committee of Review, Focus on learning : Report of the Review of Outcomes and Profiles in New South Wales Schooling (1995) recommended immediate revision of 2 aspects of the syllabus in particular : firstly, the removal from English K-6 Syllabus of outcome statements from the National Profiles and secondly, the removal of the model of grammar endorsed in the document, 'Functional Grammar'. The history of the paradigm shift from State outcomes in syllabus documents, to the inclusion of National Profiles outcomes statements, forms the first part of this study. The recommendation of the Eltis Report to remove 'Functional Grammar' from the syllabus was politically motivated and had pedagogical implications for all those teachers, professional English educators and scholars who have been in divisive debate for nearly a decade about the broadest aspect of the frame of 'Functional Grammar', namely genre, or 'text type' as it is termed in English K-6 Syllabus. This study also looks at the history of the genre theory debate about teaching students to write and the paradigm shift that led to the inclusion of genre theory in the 1994 syllabus. This study, then, examines the essentially political nature of the school subject, English, in a regional educational context of the State of NSW. By presenting a brief curriculum history of the English K-6 Syllabus and Support Document (1994) it will be seen that a curriculum document can be a focus for power struggles between State and Commonwealth Governments and a site of contestation within the educational communities who are stakeholders in subject English</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="subject">functional</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">outcomes</field><field name="subject">debate</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">pedagogy</field><field name="subject">ideology</field><field name="subject">profile</field><field name="subject">syllabus</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">teacher</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">grammar</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Academic culture, attitudes and values of leaders, and students' satisfaction with academic culture in Australia's universities</field><field name="creator">Fazaeli, Ahmad</field><field name="description">This study examined staff and leadership's attitudes to their work organisation and its environment, and, in particular, the extent to which they preferred a human or task orientation. The study then defined and measured the 'academic culture' of the institution and explored the different effects of emphasising human or task orientations on this academic culture. Finally, the relationship between academic culture and student satisfaction within the institution was explored in the research. The measure of academic culture encompassed 3 domains - planning, the way of doing things, and relationships. A set of survey research instruments was developed and piloted. These instruments measured, in addition to background characteristics of respondents, aspects of attitude to the organisation and perceptions of its academic culture. The results of the study provided evidence that stronger task-oriented attitudes of leaders and staff were associated with academic culture subscales based on 'clarity of the job' and 'goal setting' within the planning domain and 'job performance' within the way of doing things domain. Although the relationship was much weaker, stronger human-oriented attitudes were related to the academic culture subscales of 'communication and relationship' and 'social acceptance' within the relationship domain, and 'leader-subordinate interaction' in the way of doing things domain. In as much as a strong academic culture needs an emphasis on the 3 domains (planning, the way of doing things in an organisation, and relationships), the research suggested that staff and leadership need to be versatile and incorporate both task-oriented and human-oriented approaches. A number of measures of attitudes and perceptions of academic culture were significantly related to the demographic backgrounds of the participants. This emphasised the importance of treating the constructs as multi-dimensional and the leaders, staff, and students as heterogeneous groups.

It does this by focusing on the work of Pierre Bourdieu, arguably the main advocate of relexive sociology. It is argued that Bourdieu's emphasis on a 'science of practices' limits his ability to be completely relexive because it excludes moral reflexivity. This is ironic, given that Bourdieu believes that reflexivity increases scientificity. The thesis argues that Max Weber's work on religious rationalisation offers an insightful understanding of these paradoxes. His work reveals how and why Modernity witnessed a separation and tension between moral reflexivity and epistemological reflexivity. It also reveals, despite Weber's best efforts to do so, that such a paradoxical tension cannot be overcome.

The effects of the intervention were examined through a multiple baseline across settings research design. The study explored the problem of generalisation of symbol use by examining generalisation from use in choice-making to use in labeling, and to symbol comprehension. The results provide a limited validation of naturalistic intervention strategies to teach AAC use to this particular population.

In particular, the question is asked how it was possible for lesbian sadomasochism to be problematized as an ?anti-feminist? sexual practice. Lesbian feminism was committed to a modernist logic which compelled the production of ?regimes of truth?, which promoted a certain construction of ?lesbian? as a privileged form of feminist while problematizing lesbian sadomasochism. This problematization is traced to Enlightenment and humanist logics and precepts operative within feminist, lesbian feminist and gay liberationist discourses. The tendency of modernist discourses to produce singular, exclusionary identity categories and a hierarchical ordering of subject positions is also found to be present within the discourse of contemporary ?queer? theory. It is the contention of this thesis that the work of lesbian writers like Judith Butler, Shane Phelan and Teresa de Lauretis disrupts the modernist logic of the ?one? operative in both lesbian feminism and ?queer? theory and points to the theoretical and political work that needs to be done. The most urgent task facing current lesbian, gay and ?queer? theorists is the elaboration of an ethico-politics of difference, one that is attentive to the mutually constitutive multiple differences within and between subjects.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lesbianism</field><field name="subject">lesbians</field><field name="subject">lesbian politics</field><field name="subject">feminist politics</field><field name="subject">lesbian philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/187</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inhibition of mild steel corrosion in aqueous media with sodium propionate</field><field name="creator">Tavassoli-Salardini, Fereshteh.</field><field name="description">The potential use of sodium propionate as a corrosion inhibitor for mild steel in aqueous media is investigated using a range of electrochemical and surface analytical techniques.

The method that produced the best recovery is reverse aqua regia, HNO3-HC1 with ultrasonification followed by heating on a hotplate. Based on analysis of sediments from 133 sites, background concentrations were established. Elevated heavy metal concentrations were recorded in some samples. The three most polluted areas were investigated for heavy metal associations and distributions. Metal bioavailability was assessed from sediment samples by using selective extraction techniques. The association of heavy metals with different solid phases was assessed by a sequential extraction technique involving a series of extraction reagents. Pd, Cu, Fe and Cr were mainly associated with Fe/Mn oxides and organic matter plus sulphide phases. While Cd, Zn, Ni and Co which behave similarly were extracted from each step, the largest percentages of these metals were found in Fe/Mn oxides and organic matter phases. Mn was different to other metals, in that it predominantly associated with the ion exchangeable form.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">atomic absorption spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">trace element content of soil</field><field name="subject">water pollution</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of high CO2 on growth and development of rice</field><field name="creator">Seneweera, Saman P.</field><field name="description">The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is rising dramatically each year. Increases are certain to influence growth of C3 plants. This thesis focuses on the growth and development of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Jarrah).The major questions addressed in this thesis were whether elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations would : 1/ increase grain yield where the soil was flooded or unflooded under conditions of varying phosphorus supply; 2/ change the timing of development; 3/ alter the partitioning of dry weight and nutrients between the roots and shoots; and, 4/ influence grain quality. The mechanisms underlying growth and developmental changes at elevated CO2 were also investigated. After experimentation, it is concluded that the grain yield of rice will increase as the atmospheric CO2 concentration rises even when phosphorus supplies are low. The largest response to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations will occur under dryland conditions but increases of up to 60 per cent are likely in flooded rice. Importantly, there is likely to be a reduction in the life cycle of rice crops as the CO2 concentration rises. This would have the advantage that more crops could be sown in one season. The quality of the rice grain produced at high CO2 concentrations will also change, with milling quality appearance likely to improve. The cooked rice will be firmer. Experiments also showed that rice grown in flooded soil at different CO2 concentrations is an excellent system for investigating the control of plant growth and development, particularly the influence of hormones.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CO2 concentrations</field><field name="subject">rice growing</field><field name="subject">rice quality</field><field name="subject">atmospheric carbon dioxide</field><field name="subject">greenhouse gases</field><field name="subject">climatic factors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15878</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laboratory based instruction in Pakistan: comparative evaluation of three laboratory instruction methods in biological science at higher secondary school level</field><field name="creator">Cheema, Tabinda Shahid</field><field name="description">This study of laboratory based instruction at higher secondary school level was an attempt to gain some insight into the effectiveness of three laboratory instruction methods: cooperative group instruction method, individualised instruction method and lecture demonstration method on biology achievement and retention.

It argues the need to reconceptualise the way literature education is thought to benefit adolescent readers. The initial discussion identifies the issues which are raised in that document. This yields the need to redefine literature education as Human Literacy. It does so on the basis of a theoretical exploration of reader and text. Human Literacy is able to define reader response to show certain orientations which have either been left out, misunderstood or inadequately portrayed in A Statement. This thesis places Human Literacy within real world educational aims of homo economicus as well as homo sapiens sapiens. Such a context recognises liberal and utilitarian value positions, and is able to balance these in a manner which A Statement does not. In placing Human Literacy within educational philosophies of competing models of practice, literature education becomes nested within a more comprehensive understanding of education. Human Literacy provides a way by which educational value of literature is maximised. However, this projects a paradigm shift for A Statement, by identifying a liberal neglect through flawed assumptions, omissions, and contradictions. The presence of these in A Statement inhibit literature from working to best advantage. Human Literacy provides a more comprehensive way by which current theory is accommodated within an English curriculum</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English literature</field><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">English study and teaching Australia</field><field name="subject">English education</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How does educational drama enhance children's language and literacy development?</field><field name="creator">Hertzberg, Margery L.</field><field name="description">The articles in this portfolio provide a detailed account of how educational drama enhances language and literacy development, and in particular the reading of narrative texts, in a range of Australian Primary (K-6) classroom settings. The research for this portfolio was positioned within the interpretive research paradigm. A combination of both action research and case study methodology was used to investigate how the researcher's teaching practice influenced children's language and literacy development, and how the student's responses during drama sessions influenced the researcher's subsequent practice. The theoretical underpinning for these investigations was based on socio-psycholinguistic theory and critical reading theory. Both theories explain why literature as opposed to basal readers is a better resource for the development of critical reading practices and both maintain the need for teaching/learning activities that attend to the distinctive features of narrative texts. As a collection, these articles illustrate how drama strategies and/or forms such as still image, questioning in role, parallel improvisation, teacher in role, Reader's Theatre and play-building enable participants to interpret and reconstruct the meaning of a text. Furthermore, and through the process of metaxis, children reflect upon universal themes and issues through the enactment of their own stories within a fictional context. Educational drama is thus positioned as a pedagogically appropriate teaching/learning methodology for enhancing language and literacy development in primary classrooms.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drama</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">critical reading</field><field name="subject">narrative texts</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">activities</field><field name="subject">primary</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language assimilation and crosslinguistic influence : a study of German exile writers</field><field name="creator">Ferguson, Stuart Douglas</field><field name="description">Social and textual aspects of the language assimilation of German exile writers are studied. Major differences concern the length of their exile, their foreign language learning ability and their attitude to assimilating, and the primary sources are letters and diaries. Descriptive analysis is performed on the prose, mainly in the area of crosslinguistic influences. Despite their differing assimilation, the prose contains similar crosslinguistic influences. There are consistent changes in crosslinguistic influences during the course of language assimilation, initially determined by the extent of second language acquisition. However, language learning factors give way to social factors with crosslinguistic infuences ultimately governed by the functional independence of the second language. Lexically triggered code-switching is usually a step towards functionally motivated code-switching. Finally a tentative, schematic model of how the process of language assimilation causes and modifies crosslinguistic influences is proposed.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">bilingualism</field><field name="subject">psycholinguistics</field><field name="subject">code switching</field><field name="subject">linguistics</field><field name="subject">letters</field><field name="subject">diaries</field><field name="subject">German writers</field><field name="subject">exile writers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nurse and patient work: comfort and the medical-surgical patient</field><field name="creator">Walker, Annette Clare</field><field name="description">This grounded theory study investigates the experiences and perceptions of comfort and discomfort of hospital patients admitted for medical-surgical conditions, with a focus on the post-accute stage of hospitalisation. In-depth post-discharge interviews were conducted with seventeen English speaking adults who had been admitted to nine Australian hospitals. A substantive theory of finding comfort and of managing discomfort was generated. Processes of self-talk (anticipating, interpreting, accepting, making allowances and maintaining perspective) and self-care (self-help and seeking help, which involved accommodating to the level and type of help available through deferring, avoiding, persisting or desisting) were used to find comfort and to manage discomfort. The study has implications for nursign practice, management, research and education. Existing practice in the areas of assessment, communication, individualised care planning and the management of discomfort need to be strengthened if nursing care is to make a difference for this category of patient.

Results suggest that organisational IT is defined by four dimensions: IT deployment, IT skills, IT training and IT impact on the organisation, and that all four dimensions are necessary for the effective adoption of IT. Leadership philosophy emerges as the most influential determinant for effective IT adoption, whilst only certain aspects of organisational context and strategic choice variables show a significant influence of effective IT adoption.

Factors that have influenced this learning throughout the adolescent's education are identified. Nineteen case studies of the literacy development of adolescent students with mild and moderate intellectual disabilities were developed through observations in their classrooms, and of related activities. The results of the study show that there were three main influences on literacy development for these students. These were the unique nature of the learner, home and family factors and the impact of school on the literacy learning of these students from their early learning and through their years of formal education. This research adds to the current research on the learning of adolescent students with intellectual disabilities by looking specifically at literacy development and using qualitative approaches to search within and beyond the classroom for issues which affect their learning.Practitioners in education and in the care of disabled children can use the study's findings to build a framework of knowledge to develop appropriate educational placements, programs and support for learning by drawing on significant aspects of the child's personal, social and educational development.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">reading</field><field name="subject">intellectually disabled adolescent children</field><field name="subject">literacy development (Australia)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Morphological aspects of Arabic verb in translation</field><field name="creator">Ihsheish, Shaher</field><field name="description">The research examined the relationships between the morphological structures and features of Arabic and English verbs.

Through analysis of Arabic verb patterns, the research demonstrated the primacy of a morpheme as one of the significant linguistic structural units that incorporates semantic and syntactic features, and also as a pivotal translation unit.

Generally, studies concerning this understanding have focused on children between three and five years of age because it is believed that an understanding of mind develops during this period. However, evidence from naturalistic contexts suggests that many younger children can demonstrate an understanding of the mind. Despite this, the focus in many studies has been the age at which children are able to demonstrate a representational understanding of mind. Less interest has been directed towards how children use their understanding during their everyday interactions. Evidence suggests further investigations need to consider the social nature of a theory of mind. For example, a growing amount of research indicates that social contexts are important in facilitating an understanding of mind. Relationships have been reported between a theory of mind and the following: peer popularity, family size and level of fantasy play. Given these, it appears necessary for research to address the social implications of an understanding of mind in 3-5 year olds. Interview and observation methods were adopted for data collection. The interview phase of this study investigated whether or not selected characteristics of narrative influenced children's performance on four non-traditional literature based false belief tasks. Results indicated that narrative style, active participation and narrative detail were significant predictors of children's ability to demonstrate an understanding of false belief. Age was not identified as a significant variable. The results from both phases in this study suggest that 3-5 year olds can demonstrate an understanding of mind during non-traditional false belief tasks and everyday interactions. It is argued that an understanding of mind is characterised by a range of behaviours and that not all these are addressed in the traditional paradigm.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mind</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">behaviours</field><field name="subject">active participation</field><field name="subject">narrative style</field><field name="subject">interview</field><field name="subject">observation</field><field name="subject">ability</field><field name="subject">predictors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preparation for practice: an evaluation of a pre-registration Bachelor of Nursing program</field><field name="creator">Brown, Diane Mary</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to evaluate the extent to which graduates from the Bachelor of Nursing (BN) program at the University of Technology, Sydney were adequately prepared for the nursing role in the current Australian health care system.

The policy orientation of the research is evident through suggested options for leadership development which emerge from the findings of the quesionnaire. Furthermore, the notion of schools as 'learning communities' is a vision for school education which requires the transformation of the cultural elements of schools to enable all school members to be active managers of their own learning. There is a need to develop systems and processes to allow this vision for schools to emerge, and this research accepts this challenge.

The thesis examines the challenges multinational mining companies go through in the formation and control of the workforces in PNG mines. Recruitment, training, localisation and industrial relations issues are discussed in relation to several mines, including Porgera. The discussion analyses two crucial concepts, 'pluralism' and 'exceptionalism' to draw attention to the fact that PNG's industrial relations system is 'pluralistic' in nature and approach; and therefore, 'exceptional' when compared to similar developing countries. Further, the thesis also analyses two theoretical models: general mode of industrialisation and state model. It assesses their applicability and relevance to PNG's human resource development and industrial relations system, particularly in the mining industry. The research draws on data gathered through long periods of fieldwork and observation of indigenous workers in PNG mines. It discusses entry to and adaptation to industrial work by Papua New Guinea tribes people. Particularly, the emergence of an industrial workforce at Porgera mine and its human resource implications are explored and discussed. One theme is the role of recruitment and training on 'greenfield' sites in the remote locations where the mines are situated. This includes the issues, concerns and dilemmas which multinational mining companies face in trying to balance the employment expectations and training requirements of both local inhabitants and the PNG government. Attention is paid to explaining how multinational mining companies have overcome such pressures by introducing ethnic affirmative action policies which favours the employment of local inhabitants. The roles of the PNG government, mining companies, trade unions and community groups are highlighted in the operation of industrial employment relations in the mines. The general aim of the thesis is to demonstrate the emergence and interplay of pluralistic institutions and the formation of an industrial workforce as a result of the mining company.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gold mines</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">social conditions</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">Porgera</field><field name="subject">industrial relations</field><field name="subject">mineral industries</field><field name="subject">industries</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/25488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between first and second language writing skills for Iranian students in Sydney : an application of the interdependence hypothesis</field><field name="creator">Arefi, Marzieh</field><field name="description">A major question asked is whether literacy skills from a first language are able to be transferred to a second language that does not share the same writing features, grammar, graphic conventions or even the same type of writing system.

Specifically, it was designed to investigate the relationships between first language(Persian) writing skills and second language(English) writing performance. That is, it investigated the extent to which Iranian primary school children who were already literate in their first language drew upon literacy skills and concept knowledge of literacy from their first language to use in their second language.

It is a meta-portfolio and a meta-narrative. It breaks new ground by providing a conceptual framework that supports assessment processes and phenomena across multiple environments. It is a portfolio, a narrative for learning. The fundamental premises initially established in this study are constantly revisited throughout the document. These premises focus acutely on the value and worth of the portfolio authors as they negotiate their learning and develop their understandings of assessment and reflection. As the study encounters new environment it investigates the parallels between the established methodologies of assessment and equates them with the new situation. Research, literature and practice support these methodologies. Investigations into the constructs of narrative process and phenomenon led to the development of a conceptual framework that was synonymous with portfolio process and phenomenon across pre-service teacher education, primary school education and teacher professional development. Alignment of this framework with the Doctorate of Education portfolio showed a further equivalence. As well as the possibilities of the framework being useful in the development of portfolios in different environments the symbiotic nature of narratives and portfolios has subsequently shown that learning is not only demonstrated by the evidence in the portfolio but that learning occurs in the telling of the story: in the presentation of the portfolio.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">portfolios in education</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">college-school cooperation</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">training of</field><field name="subject">college students</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="subject">rating of</field><field name="subject">educational tests and measurements</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/27609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The reform of the Australian Public Service : commercialisation and its implications for public management education</field><field name="creator">Dixon, John</field><field name="description">Australia has been engaged on a comprehensive process of federal public service reform for more than 20 years. It began in the 1970s, when the long undisturbed Australian Public Service (APS) was confronted with a major review process and with a set of administrative law reforms. This was followed in the 1980s by the introduction of a set of ambitious administrative reforms, which drew strength from similar developments occurring overseas, notably in Britain, the United States, New Zealand and Canada. This created the setting for the commercialisation of the APS that began in the late 1980s, which itself created a further set of organisational and management imperatives for the APS. The articulation of the desired management competencies became a pressing priority to consolidate the administrative and commercialisation reforms and a broad consensus emerged. The next challenge was to determine how best to inculcate the desired APS management competencies. The overall conclusion drawn was that while the administrative and commercialisation reforms have moved the APS some way towards attaining the distinctive characteristics that well-performing public agencies should have, they have created a wide variety of challenges and threats yet to addressed adequately. Within an organisational and politico-administrative environment that leaves APS managers vulnerable, especially those in APS 'quasi-businesses', because they are expected to improve service delivery productivity, so as to reduce costs, while at the same time to enhance service quality. This management task requires them to confront a variety of these threats and challenges, which purveyors of public management education must help them address, if they are to meet their idiosyncratic learning needs. This requires the adoption of a learner-based, problem-centred approach to learning for, rather than about, public management.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">civil service reform</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">privatization</field><field name="subject">government business enterprises</field><field name="subject">public administration</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">government executives</field><field name="subject">training of</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/28738</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between senior primary school teachers' attitudes, knowledge and participation with respect to physical activity and their students' cardiovascular fitness levels</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Weldon Byron</field><field name="description">One of the multitude of factors that can influence the cardiovascular components of children's health related fitness is the classroom teacher's knowledge of attitudes toward and personal participation rate with repect to physical activity.

Nineteen Year Five and Year Six teachers from four suburban Sydney primary schools completed a physical activity attitudinal survey designed to ascertain their background knowledge of minimum physical activity requirements, their involvement rates, both as partcipants and as leaders of physical activity and their attitudes toward physical activity. A physical activity questionnaire was completed by 509 students in classes taught by the nineteen teachers.

This type of card is situated within a complex of performances which are constitutive of a contemporary nexus of commodification, public-private spheres, gender, interpersonal relations and discources of intimacy.As this is an inquiry into a commodity that is a texted cultural artefact, it is informed by both cultural and textual theories. The organisation of the thesis into two parts reflects its twin concerns: the first is akin to a study of the greeting card as a commodity that is given away, paying attention to practices of production, consumption and use within personal relationships. In symmetry with that exploration, Part Two is contiguous with the 'linguistic turn' that has taken many disciplines in productive directions over the duration of the twentieth century.In doing both these kinds of 'discourse analysis' articulated to an empirico-ethnographic study of a cultural artefact that embodies emotion, the thesis seeks to contribute to dialogues that are concerned with moving forward with respect to theorising relations among sociocultural practices and language and discourse.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">greeting cards</field><field name="subject">interpersonal communication</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/30762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shifts of cohesion as manifested in translation</field><field name="creator">Lascar, Elisabeth Ramirez</field><field name="description">One of the aims of this study is to identify shifts of cohesion in translation from Spanish into English, with a view to validating Blum-Kulka's proposal that explication is a universal strategy in translation. The study uses the translation work of ten advanced translation students using narrative texts of approximately 250 words in length. Some of these students are native speakers of Spanish and others native speakers of English. Another aim of the study is to examine how cohesive devices are deployed across an ability range of students and to establish whether there are systematic differences in their deployment. The study will also attempt to establish whether the levels of language competence of informants account for specific shifts of cohesion in translation and whether certain shifts of cohesion are motivated by the style of the source and target texts.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">translating</field><field name="subject">interpreting</field><field name="subject">Spanish language</field><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">cohesion</field><field name="subject">cohesion shifts</field><field name="subject">explication</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some linguistic devices in legal English that cause problems to the translation of legislative texts from English to Chinese</field><field name="creator">Kwok, Wai Hung</field><field name="description">Legal draftsmen achieve the dual characteristics of thel egislative genre, viz. precision and all-inclusiveness, by the use of various linguistic devices, among which are (i) common words with uncommon meanings; (ii) binomial and multinominal expressions; (iii) nominalization; and (iv) qualifications. Whilst these four devices are very effective for their intended purpose, they often cause lexical, semantic or syntactic problem in the comprehension and translation of texts. This thesis explores, by analysis of the corpus, the different nature and extent of such problems caused by the above four devices in the translation of legislative texts from English to Chinese. Analyses in the thesis reveal that translation problems caused by the first two of the four devices mentioned above are mainly lexical in nature, though binomials contained in qualifications may sometimes also lead to semantic ambiguity. Translation problems arising from the use of nominalization or the use of qualifications are primarily semantic in nature, and are basically a problem of handling the various semantic units in the clauses. They can occur in both the comprehension stage and the actual rendering stage of the translation process. In the former, the problem lies in the difficulty in unpacking the various semantic units in the clauses, especially in the syntactically interrupted clauses where syntactic discontinuities are caused by the use of qualifications. in the latter, the difficulty lies in the syntactic re-arrangement of those units in the target language text in a manner syntactically acceptable to the target language while strictly in accordance with each semantic relationship intended by the source language text. Both the use of nominalization and the use of qualifications also give rise to some lexical problems. The analyses in the thesis also highlights some of the linguistic and extra-linguistic pre-requisites for a translator of legislative texts, for whom a good common sense and sufficient basic legal knowledge are as important as an extremely high level of proficiency in both the source language and the target language.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">legal English</field><field name="subject">Chinese translation</field><field name="subject">linguistics</field><field name="subject">legislative texts</field><field name="subject">syntax</field><field name="subject">legal draftsmen</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of a process to assist teachers determine their professional development needs</field><field name="creator">Harris, Barry</field><field name="description">The professional development of teachers is a continuing issue that concerns both teachers and organisational administrators. This study is concerned with one aspect of this broad issue: the manner in which teachers determine their professional development needs in the context of the varying individual and organisational changes they face. To conduct this study a process to assist teachers determine their professional development needs was developed, implemented and evaluated. This occurred as a series of case studies with a group of teachers drawn from the N.S.W. Department of School Education. Throughout the study a number of key issues are considered. These include teachers' responses to professional and personal change, an examination of a holistic range of potential needs, and techniques that teachers are able to use to appraise and validate their needs. The study sought to gain new understanding of the processes used by teachers in their professional development needs analysis, and to develop a model that can be used by teachers and schools for these purposes.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teacher training</field><field name="subject">rating of teachers (Australia)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The translation of irony in Australian political commentary texts from English into Arabic</field><field name="creator">Chakhachiro, Raymond</field><field name="description">The main thesis of this study is that the translation of irony from English into Arabic in commentary texts in Australia is not amenable to traditional translation theories. The way Arabic and English speakers employ irony to express themselves reflects the linguistic and cultural distance between both languages. To tackle this problem, the study ventures into a contrastive analysis with reference to a number of linguistic and non-linguistic devices and concepts. It concentrates on the interpretation and the linguistic realisation of irony in both languages by utilising a number of contemporary linguistic models. The research takes the view that ironic devices are the foundation of the structural development of the texts in question. To demonstrate this, the speech act and conversational theories are used. The interaction between the ironic devices and the text development constitute a framework for the overall rhetorical meaning of the text. After an overview of the relevant literature of translation, contrastive analysis and comparative stylistics, an analysis/translation model is devised and implemented. A thorough contrastive analysis is made of English and Arabic commentary texts. Similarities and differences between the Arabic and English texts are found. Discrepancies were observed in the form, function and the number of ironic devices used in both languages. Based on the findings seven general strategies are proposed for the translation of irony in Australian commentary texts from English into Arabic.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">irony</field><field name="subject">Arabic</field><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="subject">English</field><field name="subject">linguistic</field><field name="subject">translation</field><field name="subject">stylistics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variable reluctance motor and drive systems</field><field name="creator">Sadri, Seyed Mohammad Reza</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the development of a machine which is termed as singly salient reluctance (SSR) motor and its drive system. The stator of SSR motor is identical to that of a conventional induction motor or any other ac machine. Its rotor has salient poles with internal flux barriers or flux guides. This research covers the detailed designs of the SSR motors and their magnetic circuit analysis using finite element method (FEM). The parameters which are important for designing the SSR motor are investigated. This investigation resulted in designs which have low manufacturing cost as well as high torque per ampere, efficiency and power factors. This thesis also researches the different drive system for the SSR motor. The SSR motor is tested as a variable speed drive with closed loop control and supplied with dc source. Therefore for this purpose a controller system is designed and built. In addition, the SSR motor supplied by ac source using open loop control is also tested for synchronous operation. Some of the proposed designs are built and their performance compared with their predicted analysis. The SSR motors showed a competitive performance compared with equivalent induction motor in both efficiency and power factor. However the validity of the theoretical designs is assessed by comparing them with experimental results. Quite good agreement between experimental and theoretical evaluations has been achieved. In addition, suggested further improvements for SSR motors and drive systems are discussed.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SSR motor</field><field name="subject">rotor</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">torque</field><field name="subject">circuit</field><field name="subject">synchronous</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing patterns in the governance and funding of higher education in China: issues and options</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Fang</field><field name="description">Since 1985, there have been major fundamental policy changes in the governance and funding of higher education in China - general devolution ( decentralisation) in resource allocation and utilisation, diversification of the funding base, and imposition of fee charges on most higher education students. This thesis examines the impact of the changes on the function of higher education, and on quality, efficiency and effectiveness of the system. This thesis formulated some overall conclusions, extrapolated from current trends in China and in other countries of the world, on the prospects of higher education governance and funding in a global perspective. This country study has identified current patterns in China strikingly similar to those found globally despite great diversity in international experience. Based on this material, the researcher predicts that the future directions of higher education governance and funding will be characterised by counter-balance of government regulation by market forces; greater efforts for cost-efficiency and funding linked to performance; further diversion of government financial priority from higher education to other sectors and greater reliance on private and more diversified funding</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">market forces</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">diversified funding</field><field name="subject">cost efficiency</field><field name="subject">private</field><field name="subject">governance</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/477</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of self-regulation on instrumental practice</field><field name="creator">Weidenbach, Vanda Geraldine</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this dissertation was to explore the psychomotor and cognitive characteristics of the practice behaviours of a group of novice keyboard instrumentalists and to identify those factors which had most significant influence on performance achievement. The pivotal question guiding the study was 'How can one characterise the effects of practice strategies on the performance outcomes of this group of novice performers?' Six research questions were examined. The first three concerned student predisposition, practice procedures, and performance achievement. The second three questions examined the relationships between personal characteristics, practice behaviours and performance outcomes. The results of the study indicate that some beginners are capable of cognitive engagement in the execution of practice. Students who planned, analysed and evaluated practice strategies, both mentally and physically, were identified as self-regulated learners. These students were the more successful achievers. Students who made use of the technology, specifically for instructional purposes, made more gains that those that did not. Accumulated practice was not found to influence performance achievement.

Typically these students are mature-aged and work full-time while studying part-time. The mature-age part-time student is considered by attrition researchers to be at the extreme end of high-risk for non-persistence in courses, having intrinsic characteristics (e.g. a long period of absence from the educational environment) and an exposure to external influences (e.g. family and work commitments) that generally make them vulnerable to dropout. Whilst there have been recent advances in self-concept theory and research, studies examining the role of self-concept in relation to attrition remain rare. The primary purpose of this research was to capitalize on recent advances in self-concept theory and research to identify the relation of the self-concept construct to attrition in the TAFE setting and the nature of self-concept for working adults. The findings provide support for : the salience of the self-concept measurement instrument used in this investigation and the research and theory on which it is based; the effectiveness of the interventions used in the present investigation to enhance persistence; and the important role of self-concept in relation to attrition</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">self-concept</field><field name="subject">attrition in higher education</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects in higher education</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/496</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrating sustainability provisions into contemporary decision making</field><field name="creator">Scott, Jennifer (Jennifer E.)</field><field name="description">Sustainable development is a multi-faceted and complex proposition, investigating such a goal required a grounded study capable of analysing real world issues. Managing such a highly diverse region as Western Sydney with its multiple demands is complicated by the plethora of government administration agencies. Contemporary land use planning policies and decisions appear frequently at odds with community values and aspirations for the region. Evidence presented in this research suggests a declining natural resource base that manifests itself in an insidious cost impost to the public sector while the benefits accrue to the private sector.Eventual developments in the resolution and maintenance of the functional integrity of the natural systems in Western Sydney may demand a major paradigm shift in economic and social policy. This research suggests that a precautionary based approach to thresholds of harm in the Western Sydney region is long overdue. Tools developed in this study appear capable of clarifying the evident land use planning paradoxes and may assist in negotiating sustainable outcomes by fostering a collaborative learning process between decision makers, experts and the community.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainable development, New South Wales</field><field name="subject">land use, New South Wales</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects of land use, NSW</field><field name="subject">Western Sydney land use</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical analysis of nutritionally important components in temperate Australian fish</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, Sharyn G.</field><field name="description">The lipid composition of five species of marine finfish from temperate Australian waters was determined.

Levels of AA, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid were also found to be comparable. The variability in fatty acid compositions was greater between samples taken from different locations than from different seasons.

It focuses on: resources available and what affordances these enable; socio-cultural contexts, discourses and family practices; nature of the use and affordances children perceive; and how school experiences differ from those at home and the impact of teachers' discourses about computing. Findings were: common activities comprised game playing, editing and decorating texts and using information texts; gender and socio-economic differences interacted with varying rules, resources, discourses, affordances, and family use and expertise; parental discourses and resources combined to generate key affordances of the computer as toy and tool; parental discourses revealed different conceptions of childhood and computers; children&#8217;s patterns of learning and use are relatively consistent across age, gender and family background &#8211; they learn by exploring and the dominant affordance is the computer as playable; teachers&#8217; discourses and conceptions lead to the marginalisation of computer use within the curriculum; at school, children have less access, control and time to use computers in ways that allow them to draw on the expertise and approaches they have developed at home. Theories are developed to show how children come to perceive the computer as playable, and how parents&#8217; and teachers&#8217; discourses position computing as marginal to the curriculum. The other issues relate to conceptions of learning, types of learning that computers afford, and the possibility that children&#8217;s approaches to learning are changing as a result of their interactions with computers</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children and computers</field><field name="subject">computer use</field><field name="subject">computers in the home</field><field name="subject">computers in education</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choice of labour flexibility vehicle within the Australian clothing industry : a case study</field><field name="creator">Bain, Lynda M.</field><field name="description">Existing theories and literature seeking to explain small business reticence to engage in enterprise bargaining, at times adopt a generalised approach which precludes or at least limits their relevance and ability to explain small business choice at the industry and even organisational level. Such explanations cannot be detached from the external contextual framework in which an organisation operates and its own, often unique, strategic corporate response to the environmental influences which are challenging it. Labour flexibility vehicles including bargaining, if chosen to facilitate broader corporate strategies, can thereby, be regarded as functionally dependent upon and interactive with the corporate orientations and objectives of the organisation which in turn are environmentally influenced and shaped. The research principally provides a focused description and analysis of the experiences of Clothingco, a small, up market, vertically integrated clothing manufacturer and retailer, which has undergone various strategic readjustments at the corporate and industrial relations level throughout the 1990s, in response to externally driven pressures. The research presents firm evidence to suggest that Clothingco has selected its labour flexibility mechanisms so that they are consistent with and able to accomodate prevailing corporate strategies and orientations. Its strategic corporate readjustments throughout the 90s, which can be perceived as falling along the continuum of cost minimisation to productivity enhancement, have in particular registered differing choices with respect to labour flexibility vehicle and strategies. In the light of the findings, the research as a preferred labour flexibility vehicle at Clothingco. These are identified as: an increasing corporate focus towards cost minimisation throughout the 1990s, coupled with an inability by management to countenance union intervention in enterprise bargaining procedures. The interaction of both these factors, rendered enterprise bargaining from the point of view of management, both a strategically and industrially inferior labour flexibility vehicle to the use of contract labour. The research's strength lies in these areas which have been highlighted and which can be monitored and tested more comprehensively in future research.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clothingco</field><field name="subject">labour flexibility</field><field name="subject">cost minimisation</field><field name="subject">organisation</field><field name="subject">contract labour</field><field name="subject">industrial relations</field><field name="subject">clothing</field><field name="subject">manufacturer</field><field name="subject">retailer</field><field name="subject">enterprise bargaining</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Major trends in contemporary Chinese painting</field><field name="creator">Shao, Yiyang</field><field name="description">Three major trends are evident in Chinese ink painting: academic reformism, modernism and neo-traditionalism. While reformists are calling for stylistic freedom and a return to humanism, modernists seek the adoption of Western modes of thought and practice to develop and reform Chinese tradition. The new literati painting which has seen a resurgence of innovative theory and technique of an indigenous Chinese painting tradition distinguishes neo-traditionalism. Many scholars believe that developments in Chinese painting represent a decline in the history of Chinese art but, in this authors&#8217; opinion, this has been a period of transformation in aesthetic conception and expression. Chinese ink painting, which is still the dominant stream in twentieth century Chinese art and a continuation of its development, can be seen in the work of many contemporary artists. It is more than likely that the pluralism in contemporary Chinese art discussed in this thesis will continue although the forms it takes will to some extent be determined by political and economic factors. It is unlikely that contemporary Chinese art will totally reject the established cultural and aesthetic systems and establish a new one, based on the Western system. The traditions of Chinese culture remain strong, and it appears much more probable that an internal &#8216;re-shaping&#8217; of both indigenous and imported elements will result in an artistic tradition that remains distinctively &#8216;Chinese&#8217; as well as contemporary</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">twentieth century Chinese painting</field><field name="subject">Western influence on Eastern art</field><field name="subject">traditional Chinese painting</field><field name="subject">contemporary art</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The critical tradition : policy and process in South African education</field><field name="creator">Naidoo, Pathmaloshini</field><field name="description">For the researcher, education is concerned fundamentally with the notion of human emancipation. In other words, it is only worth the name if it forms people capable of taking part in their own liberation. Education policy in South Africa prior to African National Congress victory in 1994 was dominated by the ideology of apartheid which led to a variety of malpractices in defining the role and status of education. The ANC victory in South Africa ushered in a period of awakening from a situation of oppression to the establishment of alternative education structures promising a redress of past imbalances through equality, justice and democracy as fundamental human rights. While the ANC policy documents may serve South African society in an educative way, it is equally important that this also implies, at a practical level, an increase in collective learning levels. This has to be done in ways that are undistorted and ways that do not devolve all authority to experts. As a preliminary to improving practices, it is vital to penetrate below the surface of the ANC policy documents to understand the true nature of things found to expose internal and external contradictions and distortions. As Durkheim (1994) says why strive for knowledge of reality if this knowledge cannot serve us in life. This implies that the pursuit of knowledge is of little value unless it can serve our interests as social and cultural beings. This thesis aims to examine the role played by the Reconstruction and Development Policy in South Africa's education system. It questions the viability of implementing the policies as set out in the policy documents, which the African National Congress claim to be derived from critical theory. The focus was on the reconstruction of the central and decisive events that have had implications for present educational policy and development. A methodological tool derived from critical theory was applied since it provided a form of meta-critique with an emancipatory rather than manipulative interest in criticism. Critical theory hence became a method of rational valuing and a powerful tool of internal and external criticism with the potential for use in practical as well as theoretical research. It thus becomes of value not only to a policy-maker but to a researcher or classroom practitioner as well. With regards to South Africa's present status, critical theory offers us a clear, less-distorted picture of how things are and at least suggests through transcendence of the existent, the possibility of how things may be different.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">South Africa</field><field name="subject">critical theory</field><field name="subject">apartheid</field><field name="subject">reconstruction</field><field name="subject">national</field><field name="subject">congress</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">ANC</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experiential learning as a basis for extension practice with Maltese vegetable growers of western Sydney</field><field name="creator">Senn, Ashley</field><field name="description">This thesis is primarily concerned with the characteristics and effectiveness of extension and adult learning within a community of Maltese vegetable growers in western Sydney. Extension was practised according to principles of experiential learning theory, action research and andragogy. The recommendation is made that extension agents should concentrate upon experiences that are within the target group's spheres of activity and interest. Kolb's experiential learning theory was found to be applicable to extension in this context. This theory, and similar principles, involve interpretivism, reflection and interaction, all of which were found to be beneficial. It was found to be sufficient for the author to inspire growers with broad concepts, which were then applied by growers to their situations. It is suggested that extension agents concern themselves less with attempts to change clients' attitudes and instead encourage them to trial innovations and draw their own conclusions. Future research should consider characteristics of the internalisation of knowledge and the role of clients' emotional well-being.

The techniques reported on multivariate process control thus far include extensions of univariate process control charts to their multivariate counterparts, ranging from classical Shewharts charts to modern Cumulative Sum Process Control charts. Alternative approaches in this area include Principal Component Approach, Partial Regression approach, Baysian modelling and sequential tests on detection of change points. Although each method has its own limitation, these new developments have significantly contributed to the achievement of a constant high quality of products and services. The techniques of process control are yet incomplete. They require continuous attention, as production and service technologies are being continuously developed.In particular, the level of automation, re-engineering of production processes and ever demanding economic optimality of technology demand the re-engineering of statistical process control.

(Andrew James)</field><field name="description">The present study examines predictors and consequences of self-handicapping and defensive pessimism (comprising defensive expectations and reflectivity) from a self-worth motivation perspective. Consistent with self-worth motivation theory, self-handicapping and defensive expectations are proposed as two strategies students use to protect their self-worth in the event of potential failure, and in some cases to enhance their worth in the event of success. Using longitudinal data derived from undergraduate students from three institutions in their first and second years at university, quantitative analyses, involving confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling, tested models in which a set of affective and motivational factors was proposed to predict self-handicapping, defensive expectations, and reflectivity. These three strategies were in turn proposed to predict a variety of academic outcomes including self-regulation, persistence, future academic plans, and grades. Both quantitative and qualitative data hold implications not only for current understanding and existing theory regarding self-handicapping and defensive pessimism, but also for educational practice and research dealing with these phenomena. On a more general level, data derived from the various studies provide new perspectives on defensive manoeuvring and the lengths to which students will go to protect their self-worth, the many reasons they pursue their studies in such a fashion and the diversity (and complexity) of consequences that follow from such behaviour</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">self-handicapping</field><field name="subject">defensive</field><field name="subject">pessimism</field><field name="subject">university students</field><field name="subject">academic success</field><field name="subject">failure</field><field name="subject">reflectivity</field><field name="subject">self-esteem</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing a constructed wetland to treat landfill leachate</field><field name="creator">Scott, Jennifer (Jennifer E.)</field><field name="description">The aim of this project was to identify a suitable solution to the problem of landfill leachate at the North Katoomba landfill site. Options were affected by a range of constraints including economics, location and the intrusion of ground water into the landfill. The initial goal was to contain and treat the leachate on site, with the eventual target to discharge into the nearest receiving waters. A constructed wetland option was devised and researched, involving identification of the major pollutants contained within the leachate, developing a concept design and estimating the likely removal efficiencies expected. Investigations identified the primary pollution parameters as microbial and nutrients. Metals were found to be low in concentration although the wetland has the capacity to deal with these pollutants should they become part of the pollution plume. A bench scale constructed wetland system was developed to give an indication of the removal efficiencies. The results suggest that a constructed wetland system would be appropriate for treating landfill leachate at the North Katoomba site. It is recommended that a constructed wetland be established in the field to determine the long term treatment prospects and the potential management problems in a practical application.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sanitary landfills</field><field name="subject">leaching</field><field name="subject">constructed wetlands</field><field name="subject">Katoomba</field><field name="subject">water pollution</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a reconstruction : governance contingency path analysis for a system's evolution after turbulence : the case of Lebanon</field><field name="creator">Helou, Mammy</field><field name="description">In this study the author attempts to evaluate structural evolutionary networks after turbulence using reconstructive logic. Analysing contingent stages of evolution provide for an in-depth study of the various forces impacting on a non-linear social system's recovery after turbulence. Similarly, such a mode of analysis allows for studying the inter-relationships among a system's endogenous and exogenous forces. Although each crisis is unique, yet an analysis of previous events would pave the way to generate learning curves geared towards the prevention, or at least mitigation, of the impact of future similar events. A detailed conceptual analysis of decision-making contexts and behavioural styles under varying levels of turbulent environmental states are evaluated to illustrate the direct and indirect inter-relationships among the actors/participants and their contributions to the creation and prolongation of a state of turbulence and instability. Since environmental states relate to the perceptions of the actors involved and their interactions over time, the connection between the two main environmental levels, namely, the system's internal micro-environmental factors - including inherent socio-political contradictions - and its external uncontrollable macro-environmental influences - incorporating regional and international forces - are evaluated. This study primarily deals with contingency planning for system's evolution after crisis. It is essentially a case study of turbulence at the national level of analysis, mainly dealing with the development of normative and predictive transferable policy implications geared towards a system's embarkation on a recovery and reconstruction mode. With this purpose in mind, this research study aims at developing a Reconstruction - Governance Contingency Path Analysis (RGPA) in terms of identifying and evaluating contingent stages of evolution based on an analysis of developmental leadership pathways. This is accomplished through an in-depth analysis of the components and conditions for a system's evolution as well as evaluating the inter-relationship between the system itself and its environment, both at the micro- and macro-levels. To illustrate its application to a specific country, the RGPA is applied to the case study of Lebanon</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reconstructive logic</field><field name="subject">Lebanon</field><field name="subject">reconstrution</field><field name="subject">environmental forces</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">behavioural styles</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the development of the sense of taste in humans</field><field name="creator">Temple, Elizabeth C.</field><field name="description">Very little research has been conducted on the development of taste perception in humans.

The aims of this thesis were (i) to investigate the growth pattern of the tongue throughout childhood / adolescence, and (ii) to determine the state of maturity of some of the aspects of the sense of taste in mid-childhood. Overall, the data in this thesis indicate that children respond similarly to adults with regard to single-point measures of sensitivity and perceived intensity, but there are some differences in the overall temporal experience of taste, from onset of perception through to extinction, and the way in which it is perceived by adults and 8-9 year old children.

The role of the host family is central to the exchange event, but hosting is often a problematic experience during which the host family faces may dilemmas. The research substantiates the relevance of family systems theory in relation to the host family and positions the host family in an intercultural context. Phenomenographic techniques are used to describe the different ways of experiencing a hosting event and to account for how these ways occur. The phenomenon of Hosting is described by the conception of Synergy. A Spectrum of Experience, rather than a hierarchy, is defined by the four components of :fit, responsibility, investment and learning. Host family dilemmas and discernment are related to prior experience of hosting and the Synergy between expectations and learning outcomes. Intercultural learning in a hosting event is identified as participants' understanding of themselves, the process of hosting, communication skills and an appreciation of cultural heritage. Host family expectations have an impact before, during and after the hosting event while realistic expectations recognise the potential for learning moments as well as the contribution that conflicts, confrontations and challenges make to learning and growth in an intercultural context. Best preparation and best practice for host family participation involves an understanding of experiential learning, training program design and strategies for ongoing support systems</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">host families</field><field name="subject">student exchange programs</field><field name="subject">host expectations</field><field name="subject">synergy</field><field name="subject">experiential learning</field><field name="subject">intercultural learning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching biotechnology in NSW schools</field><field name="creator">Steele, Frances A.</field><field name="description">Agriculture, industry and medicine are being altered by new biological technologies.

Hence biotechnology has an important place in science education. The aims of the research were to: 1/describe the state of biotechnology teaching in NSW; 2/determine whether teachers in NSW do not teach biotechnology because they do not have the necessary knowledge and experience; 3/identify other reasons why NSW teachers choose not to teach biotechnology; 4/describe problems encountered in teaching biotechnology in NSW; 5/suggest ways in which the problems encountered in the teaching of biotechnology can be overcome. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used in a complementary way to investigate these aims. In a sample of teachers surveyed, many reported that they chose not to teach biotechnology because they did not have adequate knowledge and experience. Other obstacles were identified. These were: 1/ the difficulty of the subject matter; 2/ the lack of practical work; 3/ lack of a program for biotechnology in junior science. The results of this trial suggested that a biotechnology unit should be developed in collaboration with the teacher and that time needs to be made available for school based program development.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biotechnology teaching</field><field name="subject">biotechnology study and teaching (NSW, Australia)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/671</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transition of engineers into management roles : an exploratory study in Australia</field><field name="creator">Seethamraju, Ravi C. M.</field><field name="description">A significant number of engineers move into management positions, their numbers increasing with their length of service. However, engineers are not considered to be effective managers and are generally considered inadequate in soft skills. Given the centrality of engineers and management, understanding this transition is essential in order to develop strategies for managing. This research is an exploratory field-based study of the transition of professional engineers into management roles (engineer-managers) in Australia, from the perspective of the individual engineer. The study investigates the attitudes of engineers towards such areas as engineering education, towards managerial transition, status, organizational support systems, and strategies for managing transition, and examines their influence on the process of transition. Importantly, this research examines the influence of factors such as job nature, management qualifications, age, employing organizations, and other variables on their attitudes, and studies the differences between various subgroups of engineers. This research is based on the results of a case study and a questionnaire survey. An important outcome of this research is the focus on the process of engineering education. This research concludes that different emphases in the process of teaching and learning would contribute, in the long run, to engineers developing soft skills, and so make their transition into management easier. The study found that electrical engineers are more proactive than civil or mechanical engineers and that it is necessary to develop different strategies for different groups of engineers. The study observed that the higher the status of professional engineers within an organization, the greater was the likelihood of success. Supporting the anecdotal evidence from the case study, it is noted that the more engineers there are in management positions, the better the perception of senior management about their capabilities. This study found that management education for engineers has a strong influence, both in terms of their acquiring managerial skills as well as enhancing their status within their organization. Experiential learning, though, is the most common method by which engineers acquire managerial skills. The study also found that this is the least-managed strategy in Australian organizations; learning is left entirely to the individual.

This thesis investigates the establishment of a procedure for measuring conducted emission produced by motor drives, using a virtual instrument. This procedure is based on the traditional methodology of EMI measurement and the use of simulation techniques. A test bench is designed. The thesis covers the detailed design of a virtual instrument for measuring conducted current produced by motor drives. A line impedance stabilisation network LISN is designed and built. A series of measurements were carried out using the developed instrument. The results show very little difference between the conducted emission produced by induction, permanent magnet and reluctance motor drives. Comparing one of the experimental results with published results from a major test laboratory assesses the validity of the designed instrument. The experimental results refer to drive systems under no load conditions.

To understand these issues, it is necessary to understand prevailing economic development theories which have been traditionally considered in a nation&#8217;s policymaking. A review of a wide range of theories revealed that no single theory or set of theories provides desired outcomes from the perspective of long-term economic development of a nation given its existing structure. Researchers and policymakers throughout the world are engaged in searching for suitable options, and the &#8216;regional economic development with local planning&#8217; approach for regional policymaking has been identified as a suitable option for a developed nation. The tested hypothesis of this thesis indicates that to help accelerate a smooth long-term development process of regional Australia, a suitably designed local planning approach is necessary.

While most of the papers are written from within the context of the state school system in NSW, their messages apply equally well to school systems elsewhere. The papers reflect an eclectic mix of research perspectives and methodological paradigms. It is suggested that student learning outcomes may be improved if schools specify goals and objectives, make the necessary resources available and establish accountability mechanisms for monitoring and measuring performance. The analysis and synthesis generates critical knowledge, that is, knowledge which is explanatory and interpretive. The desire to assist schools to achieve a position where they are able to (firstly) assemble their own data systems, and secondly to conduct their own analysis of this data and report this to the school community has been the common theme underpinning all the professional work of the author. The works evolved in this portfolio document an evolving process, and one which is far from concluded. There is much further work that could be done. An analysis of the macro and micro-politics of school improvement processes, for example, would be a useful contribution to the literature. For the present purposes, there is a practical need to limit the scope and number of the works presented. The works included all address, in some way, the common theme of improving school and systemic effectiveness through better information management.

Such residuals and estimation have been used to test the constancy of regression models over time and their usage has been suggested for almost all areas of regression model validation. These recursive techniques have not been developed for some of the more recent generalisations of Linear Models such as Linear Mixed Models (LMM) and their important extension to Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) which provide a suitable framework to analyse a variety of special problems in an unified way.

UV is the main irradiation source used. The grafting yields have been found to vary with parameters such as the subtrate types and thickness, MMA concentration, solvents used, Irgacure 819 concentration and UV doses. For the cellulose subtrate, good grafting yields were obtained only when solvents such as methanol and DMF were used. On the contrary, MMA could graft to PPE with or without solvents, although high grafting yields were achieved in the presence of methanol, DMF and other chlorinated solvents. The solvent effects on the grafting process of MMA to PPE and cellulose subtrates were attributed to the wetting and swelling effects by the solvents as well as the Trommsdorff effect. During the course of this study, a comparison in the performance between Irgacure 819 and other photoinitiators (PIs) was also carried out. A study was made of the UV radiation induced grafting of styrene to PPE subtrate with EP vinyl monomers and vinyl ethers as comonomers. The possibility of spontaneous polymerization of styrene/EP vinyl monomer mixtures under the influence of UV radiation was also investigated. Grafting yields were found to vary with the comonomer types and their concentrations, the presence or absence of solvents and additives such as Irgacure 819 photoinitiator, K185 cationic photoinitiator, mineral acids and CT complexes.

It is the way people communicate with one another to express thoughts, ideas, decisions, desires and essentially to relay information successfully. There are numerous types of language, perhaps the most common of which are the written and spoken languages. Other forms include sign language, Braille and even primitive smoke signals. The term language comes via French, from the Latin word lingua meaning tongue. Even today, the spoken language is often referred to as tongue. It is not known exactly when language began or even how it began, although a common theory is that it began as an imitation of natural sounds of animals such as grunts, groans, whistles and barks. What is known, however, is that language changes everyday as it is influenced by human and historical changes. Words that exist in our vocabulary today did not exist for example a hundred years ago. Nor, perhaps, will they exist a hundred years from now. This is the same for all languages around the world, including the Italian language. Since the beginning of Italian history, Italians have spoken innumerable varieties of language. Discussions concerning these countless varieties could continue incessantly; and for this reason it is important to outline immediately the aim of this discussion. Throughout the ensuing chapters, all information gathered and analysed, has been done in order to achieve one aim: to discuss the existence of a standard Italian language in Australia as well as various dialects and regional varieties, and to analyse its promotion since Italian immigration to Australia.

In the thesis I also distinguish three groups of paintings in essays and describe my work and the way in which theory and practice have recommended one another. 'Salience and Surrealism' discusses how the features of collaboration, play and partnership involve women artists within the surrealist movement, and how their ideas of the feminine principle evolve and change. I also discuss the changing attitudes to imagination, creative inspiration and activity, and the understanding brought about by the meeting between surrealism and psychology. The salience of surrealism as an introverted urge and instinct toward individuation, is suggested by Kenneth Wack 'as the source of surrealism's most abiding success.' The contemporary use of salience applies to features, characteristics, and from architecture as protrusions or fortifications. The dictionary definition begins with extroverted examples like dancig, leaping about and jetting forth. The archaic meaning is origin or first beginning, hence in old medicine salience applies to the heart when it first shows in the embryo. In salience the anagram of, a silence, gave heed to the atmosphere of silence from creativity and in paintings. A silence, also corresponds with the middle part of Meret Oppenheim's life when she experienced an artisitc crisis and depression. This essay looks back fifty years of self-expression from this artist and finds prominent features to suggest the essential dichotomies which mark the artwork. Meret Oppenheim's ouevre includes painting, sculpture, poetry, books, and theatre costume and apparal. Her multiple talents in the arts and literature are like those of Leonora Carrington who has published several books and plays, in the visual arts she sculpted and painted. The salience of their creative and intellectual endeavours found realisation in the wisdom of the feminine, of animal spirits and of natural worlds. The principles of alchemy also inspired and informed their attitudes to creativity which emerges from the unification of opposites. Both artists called for a new alliance between male and female principles, and evolve concepts of androgyny, which for them lift creation to higher levels.

A significant element within these changes is Walter Benjamin's concept of the 'aura'. This research paper examines the social aura contained in the space of a nineteenth century European city, the aural perception of an individual mobile gaze, and the decay of the aura that results from the decline of experience in the contemporary metropolis. I have linked the decline of experience and loss of aura to the arrival of photography in the 1840's. This new technology had the ability to fix a visual image into a permanent record and as recorder of reality, had a large impact on perception. For example, it had the ability to bring the exotic near, and provide close-ups of natural objects not possible with the naked eye. The camera 'sees' in a different way to how the eye 'sees'', yet photographic seeing is accepted as being the normal mode of perception. It is a way to capture an experience, and to relive this at a later date by providing a reference point for memory; the modern gaze looks back, it lacks a lived experience in the now</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aura</field><field name="subject">photography</field><field name="subject">visual image</field><field name="subject">Walter Benjamin</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/772</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model for registering teachers, accrediting teacher education and awarding advanced certification in Australia : a means for advancing the status of teaching as an autonomous profession</field><field name="creator">O'Donnell, Brian Charles</field><field name="description">Teaching in Australia is acknowledged as a profession. The public, however, generally perceives teaching as a poorly paid occupation whose practitioners exert little control over their own standards of practice. Consequently, the professional status of teachers is low, and very few of the most capable school leavers and high ability university graduates are attracted to teaching as a career. Furthermore, teachers' perceptions that the public does not appreciate their work have led to low morale, high rates of resignations, and early retirements among experienced practitioners. These factors will contribute to serious shortages of teachers in the new millennium. In the past Australian employers in both government and non-government school sectors have attempted to circumvent teacher shortages by reducing qualifications required for teaching. This anti-professional practice has contributed to the belief that teaching is something that anyone can do. It is argued in this thesis that the status of the teaching profession in Australia must be enhanced if teaching is to attract capable new recruits and retain knowledgeable, experienced practitioners. This could be achieved by giving teachers greater responsibility for their profession's standards through a system of statutory regulatory boards, comprised largely of practising teachers. The boards would be responsible for establishing and enforcing standards for registration of teachers, accreditation of teacher education, and provision of advanced certification. Furthermore, such regulation of the profession should be on a national basis to ensure that all children in all schools in Australia have access to competent, professionally qualified teachers, and to overcome the problems of interstate mobility of teachers. The thesis concludes by calling on all stakeholders to acknowledge teaching as a full profession. This could be achieved by accepting that teachers should regulate their professional standards in the same way that other professions do. A model to achieve that end is presented.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">regulation</field><field name="subject">accreditation</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">standards</field><field name="subject">skill</field><field name="subject">certification</field><field name="subject">professional</field><field name="subject">qualifications</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/78</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modes of representation of ideas, computers and learning styles in K-6 mathematics</field><field name="creator">Lewis, Edward John</field><field name="description">Constructivist theories of mathematics learning suggest that learners personally negotiate meaning by creating different mental representations of mathematical knowledge. They may then progress towards relational understandings of mathematical ideas by making connections between the different modes of representation.

This thesis investigates the use of the computer as a transition device in linking different modes of representation of mathematical knowledge. A particular software package was chosen and three teaching treatments were devised, corresponding to three different modes of representation of knowledge. Computers were used to provide a pictorial treatment, Dienes' Base 10 Arithmetic Blocks were used to provide a treatment which was predominantly concrete, and teacher exposition provided a treatment which conformed to symbolic instruction. Quantitative analysis of the data collected found no significant statistical differences in achievement outcomes of any treatment groups. The findings of this investigation do not support the contentions that the computer is a necessary link between concrete and symbolic modes of representation of knowledge, or that programs in which teaching style is matched to the preferred learning style of students lead to increased attainment by students</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="subject">data</field><field name="subject">computer</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">learning style</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/81</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Concepts of viewpoint and erasure: Botany Bay</field><field name="creator">Provest, Ian S</field><field name="description">When Captain James Cook sailed into Botany Bay in Australia for the first time in 1770, his botanist Joseph Banks described the behaviour of the Aboriginals to be 'totally unmovd' and 'totally engagd'.During this same few days Cook named the place Stingray Bay.

The name 'Stingray' and its change to 'Botany' raises political questions about the necessity for the change. The change also sheds light on a viewpoint at odds with its subject. The events that occurred during the eight days Cook was anchored in Botany Bay will be discussed firstly in the framework of an analysis of the implications of the terms 'totally unmovd' and 'totally engagd' in Banks' journal, and secondly in a discussion about the various historical notions concerning the name change. Did these curly histories and viewpoints render the indigenous culture invisible? Can these inscriptions made by Cook and Banks and the subsequent mythologies surrounding them, including those about the actual place, be a metaphor for 'further understanding'?</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian discovery and exploration</field><field name="subject">Australian aborigines</field><field name="subject">Australian history to 1788</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment and undergraduate learning</field><field name="creator">Koop, Gabrielle A.</field><field name="description">This study is an investigation of the relationship between assessment, teaching and learning from the perspective of undergraduate students.

This study probes not only the construction of aboriginal childhood in children's fiction, but explores the slippage between the lived and imagined experiences which inform the textual and illustrative images of non-Aboriginal writers. This study further contends that neo-colonial variations on the themes informing these images remain part of Australian children's fiction. Aboriginal childhood has played a limited but telling role in Australian children's literature. The very lack of attention to Aboriginal children in Australian children's fiction - white silence - is resonant with denial and self-justification. Although it concentrates on constructions of aboriginal childhood in white Australian children's fiction, this study highlights the role that racial imagery can play in any society, past or present by securing the unwitting allegiance of the young to values and institutions threatened by the forces of change. By examining the image of the Other through four broad thematic bands or myths - the Aboriginal child as the primitive; the identification of the marginalised and as the assimilated and noting the essential similarities that circulate among the chosen texts, this study attempts to reveal how pervasive and controlling the logic of racial and national superiority continues to be. By exploring the dissemination of images of Aboriginal childhood in this way, this study argues that long-lived distortions and misconceptions will become clearer</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aborigines</field><field name="subject">non-Aboriginal writers</field><field name="subject">assimilated</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">M&#257;ori organisation and contemporary M&#257;ori development : strengthening the conceptual plait : a thesis presented for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in M&#257;ori Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Puketapu, Brendon Te Tiwha</field><field name="description">This thesis is primarily a study of organisational approaches used by Maori to achieve their development goals and aspirations. One focus is the impact of development ideas and practice, largely driven by international and national influence, upon Maori. Another focus is the role of the state in the direction and implementation of Maori development with particular emphasis on the impact of the structural adjustment programme. As a consequence, the relationships between Maori and the state, Maori and Maori, and Maori with others are critically examined. The thesis canvasses a number of disciplines including Maori history, ecology, sociology, anthropology, environmental studies, management, and development studies. Engaging with this broad spectrum of ideas and actions and using literature based, empirical and participatory research tools, three themes are explored. They are: (i) The theme of 'development' which examines international and national perspectives of development in order to identify the merits of Shifting the praxis of Maori development; (ii) The theme of 'organisation' which explores local and wider perspectives of organisational theory and practice in order to identify the implications for Maori organisations; (iii) The theme of 'relationship' which investigates a wide range of perspectives about the dynamic relationships between Maori themselves and with others, and the opportunities to reaffinn and build new relationships. The thesis concludes with an analysis of current thought and action before presenting five major conclusions. In essence and simply stated, if Maori self-determination is the destination then the journey is best guided by a Maori centred approach to development and organisational arrangements that are cognisant of the contemporary circumstances, in particular the relationship dynamics, that challenge Maori and the life choices they make.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori development</field><field name="subject">politics and government</field><field name="subject">organisation</field><field name="subject">government relations</field><field name="subject">economic conditions</field><field name="subject">social conditions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360101 New Zealand government and politics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whakapumau te mauri : values-based Maori organisations : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Maori Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Knox, Colin</field><field name="description">The political and economic history of New Zealand since the turn of the nineteenth century has been characterised by the colonisation of the indigenous Maori people by settlers mainly from Britain. In 1840 the British Crown and representative Maori Rangatira signed the Maori language version of the Treaty of Waitangi, which guaranteed to Maori continuing ownership of their land and natural resources, and self determination under the protection of the Crown, What Maori did not know in signing the Treaty was that already thousands of new settlers were being recruited in Britain on the promise of a paradise, where vacant land could be purchased cheaply and every man was the equal of his master. While the Maori population was in decline following the introduction of disease and the musket, the immigrant European population exploded. It established a Westminster styled Government which in its early years included no Maori, and passed laws which over the next 50 years alienated Maori from 95% of their land, prevented Maori from accumulating capital and participating in the most rewarding industries, and imposed alien social institutions on a previously well organised and successful people. For many Maori in the twenty-first century, the legacy of colonisation has been either marginalisation in rural communities on land frozen by legal structures which run counter to traditional values and procedures, or migration to towns and cities where employment opportunities are mainly in less skilled work and subject to variation in the economy. This thesis examines the extent of the displacement of the institutions of Maori society and its impact on the development of Maori land and other assets. It proposes an approach which could assist shareholders in Maori land to reassert traditional values and tikanga and promote collective decision making, while gaining understanding of the concepts and language of business and organisations and a skill base for greater participation in the organisations which own and manage their assets. The research results are promising, with participants in a research project accepting an approach to governance and organisation which bridges tikanga and modem business structures. There is evidence from an extended case study that the approach engenders a confidence which has positive social and cultural outcomes while encouraging the development of Maori land</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">politics and government</field><field name="subject">community organisation</field><field name="subject">Maori land</field><field name="subject">Maori development</field><field name="subject">Maori organisations</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360101 New Zealand government and politics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temporal landscapes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jacobson, Shelley</field><field name="description">Temporal Landscapes is a research project concerned with culture-nature relations in the context of contemporary industrial land use in New Zealand; explored visually through the photographic representation and presentation of gold mining sites &#8211; former, current and prospective &#8211; in the Hauraki region. In the current period of industrial capitalism, featuring the mass exploitation of natural resources, nature is commonly thought of as subservient to humankind. This stance, with its origin in scientific ideology of the 17th Century, is interesting to consider in relation to contemporary notions of landscape, and the &#8216;ideal&#8217; in nature. In New Zealand, a balance is being sought between interests of sustainability and conservation, and of industry and economy. This is not to say that industry opposes environmental safeguards; in contrast, sustainable management including the rehabilitation of land post-industrialisation is integral to modern mining practice in New Zealand. With this emphasis on controlled industrial progress, two key factors emerge. Firstly, this level of control implicates itself as a utopian vision, and secondly, industrialisation is advocated as a temporary situation, with industrial land as transitory, on the path to rehabilitation. The research question of Temporal Landscapes asks; in considering contemporary industrial land use in New Zealand within a utopian framework &#8211; focussing specifically on gold mining in the Hauraki Region &#8211; has our ideal in nature become that of a controlled, even post-industrial, landscape? The photographic representation of these sites offers a means to explore and express their visual temporality. With the expectation of industrial sites as fleeting and rehabilitated sites as static utopias, it would seem that this industrial process is a kind of contemporary ideal.

Methods from solid state physics and quantum chemistry are combined to shed light on some of the unusual properties of water and ice. For the ground state of crystalline ice, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are compared to an ab initio incremental ansatz that utilizes periodic Hartree-Fock together with localized electron correlation calculations. It is shown that the many-body decomposition of the electron correlation converges very fast, allowing the achievement of excellent agreement with experimental data even when limiting correlation energy contributions to two-body terms only. The incremental method is utilized by a computer program that combines the periodic and localized calculations, and allows for structural optimization of the system of interest. The adsorption of water molecules on the surface of ice is studied using DFT. Adsorption is found to be favoured on non-crystallographic adsorption sites, and a slight tendency towards the formation of rough surfaces is reported. The localization of excess electrons at the surface of ice is facilitated by coadsorbed water molecules. For a correct theoretical description of the latter, a self-interaction correction scheme for the excess electron has to be used. However, it is sufficient to limit the self-interaction correction to the excess electron only, since the neutral ice surface itself is well described within conventional DFT. The self-interaction correction scheme is incorporated into a commonly used DFT program package. Optical excitations of crystalline ice are calculated using many-body perturbation theory. Solving the two-particle Bethe-Salpeter equation yields optical spectra in excellent agreement with experimental data. Based on this agreement, an embedding model is developed that reduces the hydrogen bond network to its most important contribution. The model is applied to crystalline ice, where it reproduces the experimental spectral features, and to microscopic liquid water structures obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, where it reproduces the energy shift of the first absorption peak and gives overall good agreement with experiment. The driving force of water&#8217;s anomalous optical behaviour is identified.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">properties of ice</field><field name="subject">properties of water</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">optical properties</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250100 Physical Chemistry (Incl.

This research introduces a health promotion programme to employees at a call centre.

A questionnaire was used to collect data retrospectively. The health promotion group (HPG) made positive changes in all behaviours unlike the nutritional group (NG) and the control group (CG).

The responses of the local iwi/Maori community, the Crown, and others to the re-emergence of the new iwi entity are critically examined. The thesis demonstrates how a small iwi group resists attempts to assimilate into a broader coalition of iwi, hapu, whanau and marae interests, preferring instead to maintain and develop its own distinctive identity. It uses the iwi Ngati Tama to exemplify the diaspora of an iwi, and shows how iwi identity and fortunes are buffeted by both iwi and urban contestations as well as changing political directions. The study suggests that a Ngati Tama future away from its homeland will depend primarily on the development of pragmatic adaptive and innovative strategies, and a fervent resolve to retain a distinctive identity, while participating in a dynamic and often oppressive environment. This thesis concludes that to maintain a distinctive iwi presence its members should have the right to decide who best represents them. An iwi is considered an appropriate vehicle to represent its members and manage its interests. In order to survive in a constantly changing environment, an iwi must be dynamic, flexible, relevant, and meet the needs of its membership. Further, its leadership should be focused on negotiating relationships in good faith - including third party interventions - and seeking pathways that will advance its interests into the future.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">politics and government</field><field name="subject">tribal government</field><field name="subject">iwi</field><field name="subject">Ngati Tama ki Poneke</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360101 New Zealand government and politics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/911</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formal symbolic verification using heuristic search and abstraction techniques</field><field name="creator">Qian, Kairong, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Computing devices are pervading our everyday life and imposing challenges for designers that have the responsibility of producing reliable hardware and software systems. As systems grow in size and complexity, it becomes increasingly difficult to verify whether a design works as intended. Conventional verification methods, such as simulation and testing, exercise only parts of the system and from these parts, draw conclusions about the correctness of the total design. For complex designs, the parts of the system that can be verified are relatively small. Formal verification aims to overcome this problem. Instead of exercising the system, formal verification builds mathematical models of designs and proves whether properties hold in these models. In doing so, it at least aims to cover the complete design. Model checking is a formal verification method that automatically verifies a model of a design, or generates diagnostic information if the model cannot be verified. It is because of this usability and level of automation that model checking has gained a high degree of success in verifying circuit designs. The major disadvantage of model checking is its poor scalability. This is due to its algorithmic nature: namely, every state of the model needs to be enumerated. In practice, properties of interest may not need the exhaustive enumeration of the model state space. Many properties can be verified (or falsified) by examining a small number of states. In such cases, exhaustive algorithms can be replaced with search algorithms that are directed by heuristics. Methods based on heuristics generally scale well. This thesis investigates non-exhaustive model checking algorithms and focuses on error detection in system verification. The approach is based on a novel integration of symbolic model checking, heuristic search and abstraction techniques to produce a framework that we call abstractiondirected model checking. There are 3 main components in this framework. First, binary decision diagrams (BDDs) and heuristic search are combined to develop a symbolic heuristic search algorithm. This algorithm is used to detect errors. Second, abstraction techniques are applied in an iterative way. In the initial phase, the model is abstracted, and this model is verified using exhaustive algorithms. If a definitive verification result cannot be obtained, the same abstraction is re-used to generate a search heuristic. The heuristic in turn is used to direct a search algorithm that searches for error states in the concrete model. Third, a model transformation mechanism converts an arbitrary branching-time property to a reachability property. Essentially, this component allows this framework to be applied to a more general class of temporal property. By amalgamating these three components, the framework offers a new verification methodology that speeds up error detection in formal verification. The current implementation of this framework indicates that it can outperform existing standard techniques both in run-time and memory consumption, and scales much better than conventional model checking.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heuristic programming</field><field name="subject">Computer algorithms</field><field name="subject">Computer software - Verification</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of new factors involved in cholesterol homeostasis</field><field name="creator">Du, Ximing Robin, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The regulatory pool of cholesterol is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is key to how mammalian cells sense and respond to changes in cellular cholesterol levels. The extent of cholesterol esterification by the ER-resident protein, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyl-transferase (ACAT), has become the standard method for monitoring cholesterol transport to the ER and is assumed to reflect the regulatory pool of ER cholesterol. The oxysterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), is thought to trigger intracellular cholesterol transport to the ER. Chapter 3 of this thesis addressed whether or not cholesterol esterification necessarily reflects cholesterol movement to the cholesterol homeostatic machinery in the ER as determined by SREBP processing. Three agents that inhibited the ability of 25HC to induce cholesterol esterification (progesterone, nigericin, and monensin) did not have a corresponding effect on 25HC suppression of SREBP processing. Moreover, ACAT inhibition did not alter the sensitivity of SREBP processing to 25HC. These findings indicate that cholesterol esterification by the ER-resident protein ACAT is dissociable from cholesterol transport to the cholesterol homeostatic machinery in the ER.  In order to readily analyse and quantify the processing of SREBP-2, the master regulator of cholesterol homeostasis, the second part of this study (Chapter 4) established a stable cell-line (13A/PS) that expresses the fusion protein PLAP-BP2 (secreted form of placental alkaline phosphatase joined to the luminal loop of SREBP-2 on the NH2- terminal side of Site-1). Processing of PLAP-BP2 mimics the cleavage of SREBP. The PLAP-BP2 cleavage assay was shown to be a valuable method for analysing and quantifying SREBP-2 processing. Compared to transiently transfected cells, the stable 13A/PS cells were more responsive to changes of sterol status in regards to PLAP secretion. Considering the reliability and consistency of the experiments, the 13A/PS cell-line is therefore a useful tool for the study of SREBP-2 processing.  Akt is a critical regulator of cell growth, proliferation and survival that is activated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 investigated the role of PI3K/Akt in activation of SREBP-2 increased in response to statin treatment and various cholesterol depletion approaches. The increase of SREBP-2 processing by statins or insulin-like growth factor-1 was blunted by treatment with a potent and specific inhibitor of PI3K, LY294002, or when a plasmid encoding a dominant-negative form of Akt (DNAkt) was expressed. Furthermore, LY294002 treatment down-regulated SREBP-2 or -1c gene targets, and decreased cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. Fluorescence microscopy studies indicated that LY294002 disrupts transport of the SREBP escort protein, SCAP, from the ER to the Golgi. This disruption was also shown by immunofluorescence staining when DN-Akt was expressed. These data indicate that the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in SREBP-2 transport to the Golgi, contributing to the control of SREBP-2 activation. The results provide a crucial mechanistic link between the SREBP and PI3K/Akt pathways which may be reconciled teleologically since synthesis of new membrane is an absolute requirement for cell growth and proliferation.  This thesis has provided the first evidence that there is an Akt dependent step in SREBP/SCAP transport to the Golgi, adding another input into SREBP activation beside the familiar lipid end products. However, since the Akt protein target involved in the ER-to-Golgi transport of SREBP/SCAP is still elusive, further studies are required to elucidate how Akt exerts its effects, which will potentially reveal new component(s) or pathway(s) involved in cellular cholesterol homeostasis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cholesterol.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39827</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The writing on the wall: language, colonialism and the war on terror</field><field name="creator">Chambers, Barnaby, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">??The real Great Wall of China is Chinese characters.?? My Chinese teacher said this in an off-hand way during my first Chinese lesson. Learning to read and write in Chinese is an extremely daunting task for a westerner, but the effort can open the door to an understanding of the culture like no other. My work is concerned with the notions of cultural barriers, misunderstandings and misinterpretations. I enjoy the difficulties in communication that happen as a regular part of life and I hope to reflect this in my work. Language is a large part of identity. In Australia, for example, mateship, as a linguistic expression of a cultural concept, carries a huge weight of authority. As a concept mateship developed amid racial tension on the gold fields of the mid 1800s, evolved among the diggers in the trenches of Gallipoli and the Western front, and it flourishes today as part of modern Australia. As Australians, our war-time history and the language and ideology of that history form a big part of our identity and so influence the cultural assumptions we make. Through my art I try to be a voice pointing out the unquestioning acceptance of cultural assumptions. I rely heavily on elements reflecting childhood, toys and games. Like many people I became interested in art through toys and childhood play. Constructing model war planes was how I learned to create. The irony of learning to create through violent and destructive images and the sense of fun inherent in the toys that I use are very important in my art. Not only do the toys contribute playfulness and accessibility, but it contrasts disturbingly with the darker side of globalisation and colonialism, be it the old style colonialism of the world of Tintin or the neo-colonialism depicted in the War on Terror.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42060</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical modelling of time-dependent cracking and deformation of reinforced concrete structures</field><field name="creator">Chong, Kak Tien, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">For a structure to remain serviceable, crack widths must be small enough to be acceptable from an aesthetic point of view, small enough to avoid waterproofing problems and small enough to prevent the ingress of water that may lead to corrosion of the reinforcement. Crack control is therefore an important aspect of the design of reinforced concrete structures at the serviceability limit state. Despite its importance, code methods for crack control have been developed, in the main, from laboratory observations of the instantaneous behaviour of reinforced concrete members under load and fail to account adequately for the time-dependent development of cracking. In this study numerical models have been developed to investigate timedependent cracking of reinforced concrete structures. Two approaches were adopted to simulate cracking in reinforced concrete members. The first approach is the distributed cracking approach. In this approach, steel reinforcement is smeared through the concrete elements and bond-slip between steel and concrete is accounted for indirectly by including the tension stiffening effect. The second approach is the localized cracking approach, in which concrete fracture models are used in conjunction with bond-slip interface elements to model stress transfer between concrete and steel. Creep of concrete has been incorporated into the models by adopting the principle of superposition and the time-dependent development of shrinkage strain of concrete is modelled using an approximating function. Both creep and shrinkage were treated as inelastic pre-strains and applied to the discretized structure as equivalent nodal forces. Apart from material non-linearity, non-linearity arising from large deformation was also accounted for using the updated Lagrangian formulation. The numerical models were used to simulate a series of laboratory tests for verification purposes. The models were assessed critically by comparing the numerical results with the test data and the numerical results are shown to have good correlations with the test results. In addition, a comparison was undertaken among the numerical models and the pros and cons of each model were evaluated. A series of controlled parametric numerical experiments was devised and carried out using one of the numerical models. Various parameters were identified and investigated in the parametric study. The effects of the parameters were thoroughly examined and the interactions between the parameters were discussed in detail.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ConcreteCracking</field><field name="subject">Reinforced concrete.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20634</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of microsatellites as a surrogate for quantitative trait variation in conservation</field><field name="creator">Gunn, Melissa Rose, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Conservation biologists are interested in maintaining genetic variation in small populations, with a view to maintaining fitness and the ability of the species to adapt to changing environmental conditions. The most important type of genetic variation is therefore that which affects fitness and reproduction, and is therefore subject to natural selection. Such fitness traits are often quantitative, i.e. are the result of a suite of loci, and are continuously variable. Microsatellite markers are a popular method of determining the level of variation present in a species??? genome. The assumption is made that microsatellites, which are neutral markers, behave in the same manner as quantitative traits. If this assumption were proved incorrect, then the use of neutral markers in conservation monitoring would have to be re-evaluated. In this study, experiments have been conducted using Drosophila melanogaster to test the assumption that variation in quantitative traits under stabilising selection declines at the same rate as heterozygosity in microsatellite markers, during a population bottleneck. Experimental population bottlenecks were of two effective population sizes (Ne), Ne=2 for one generation and Ne=60 for 35 generations. Based on the effective population size, we expected both types of bottlenecks to lose 25% of neutral genetic variation. Ten replicates of each bottleneck were maintained, along with four large control populations with Ne=320. In each population, heterozygosity (He) for eight microsatellite loci was compared with the heritability and additive genetic variance of two quantitative traits subject to balancing selection: fecundity and sternopleural bristle number. Microsatellite heterozygosity decreased in accordance with neutral predictions, whereas additive genetic variation in quantitative traits altered more than expected in both large and in bottlenecked populations relative to the initial sampling values, indicating that variation in quantitative traits was not being lost at the same rate as predicted by neutral theory. For most traits, the changes in additive genetic variance were congruent in all populations, large or bottlenecked. This congruence suggests that a common process was affecting all populations, such as adaptation. A mite infestation in early generations is a possible source of selective pressure. When bottlenecked populations were compared to the contemporaneous large populations (Ne = 320), the additive genetic variance of most traits was seen to have been lost in accordance with predictions from the loss of microsatellite heterozygosity. Loss of variation in microsatellites can thus be used to predict the loss of variation in quantitative traits due to bottlenecks, but not to predict the potentially much larger changes due to other processes such as adaptation. The effects of concurrent environmental stress and reduced population size were also evaluated. Endangered populations are often subject to environmental stress in addition to reduced population size, but the effect of stress on the additive genetic variance of fitness traits in organisms undergoing population bottlenecks is unknown. If the presence of stress alters the level of additive genetic variance in fitness traits, the viability of such populations could be substantially affected. The loss of microsatellite heterozygosity was not affected by the presence of a stress agent during a bottleneck. I found some significant effects of stress on the additive genetic variance of sternopleural bristles and fecundity; there was also a significant interaction between stress and the response to directional selection in sternopleural bristles. There was also an increase in the coefficient of variation of VA for sternopleural bristles. Stress may therefore affect the manner in which populations respond to selective pressures.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetic markers; microsatellites (genetics)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22457</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional regulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-?? in vascular smooth muscle cells</field><field name="creator">Bonello, Michelle Rita, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular occlusive disorders such as atherosclerosis and restenosis, in part due to its regulation of smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype. The molecular mechanisms regulating the expression of PDGF-receptor-?? (PDGF-R-??), which binds all known dimeric forms of PDGF except PDGF-DD, are poorly understood. Here it is demonstrated that PDGF-R-?? protein and transcriptional regulation in SMCs is under the positive regulatory influence of the zinc finger nuclear protein, Sp1. An atypical G-rich Sp1-binding element from -61 to -52 bp (-61G10 - 52) upstream of the transcriptional start site, was identified in the PDGF-R-?? promoter via electrophoretic mobility shift, competition and supershift analysis. Mutation of this sequence ablated endogenous Sp1 binding and activation of the PDGF-R-?? promoter. In addition to Sp1 regulation of PDGF-R-??, it was shown that fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) represses PDGF-R-?? transcription, mRNA and protein expression in SMCs. The FGF-2-induced inhibition of PDGF-R-?? was rescued by block of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling. Interestingly, mutation of the aforementioned novel Sp1-response-element blocked FGF-2-induced repression of PDGF-R-?? transcription. FGF-2 was also shown to stimulate Sp1 phosphorylation in an ERK1/2-dependent manner, enhancing its interaction with the PDGF-R-?? promoter. Further analysis revealed that mutations of residues Thr453 and Thr739 in Sp1 resulted in loss of FGF-2-mediated repression of PDGF-R-?? transcription. These findings demonstrate that FGF-2 stimulates ERK1/2- dependent Sp1 phosphorylation, thereby repressing PDGF-R-?? transcription via Sp1 binding the -61/-52 element in the PDGF-R-?? promoter. Thus, phosphorylation triggered by FGF-2, switches Sp1 from an activator to a repressor of PDGF-R-?? transcription, a finding previously unreported in any Sp1-dependent gene. It is also shown in this thesis that the proto-oncogene Ets-1 controls PDGF-R-?? transcription and mRNA expression in SMCs. Mutational, electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed the existence of a reverse Ets binding motif (-45TTCC-42) in the proximal region of the PDGFR- ?? promoter which bound both recombinant and endogenous Ets-1. Ets-1- inducible PDGF-R-?? expression was dependent upon the integrity of both the - 45TTCC-42 motif and the previously identified -61G10 -52 element, which resides upstream of -45TTCC-42 and mediates Sp1 induction. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at nanomolar concentrations, stimulated levels of Ets-1 and increased PDGF-R- ?? transcription and mRNA expression without affecting Sp1 expression. Disruption of the -45TTCC-42 motif or -61G10 -52 element blocked H2O2 activation of the PDGF-R-?? promoter. These studies identify a functional Ets motif in the PDGF-R-?? promoter which plays a pivotal role in agonist-inducible PDGF-R-?? transcription. The interplay between transcription factors such as Sp1 and Ets- 1 in the promoter of genes can exert profound influences on gene regulation. Modulating gene expression affects biological processes such as SMC proliferation and phenotype changes, which contributes to changes in vessel integrity, a hallmark of atherosclerosis. This study provides a greater insight in the functional consequences of Sp1 and Ets-1 interplay in PDGF-R-?? gene regulation and in general, provides a greater understanding of the functional regulation of cooperating transcription factors.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of cadmium on food allergy</field><field name="creator">Boupha, Prasongsidh C.</field><field name="description">Assessement of effects of cadium chloride exposure on the anaphylaxis reaction to food was done on six week old Swiss and BALB/c female mice.

Major algorithms are presented in detail, and how answer sets can be derived from the algorithm demonstrated. Under this implementation, a PLP is computed efficiently based on previous Niemela and Simons' method of computing stable models of logic programs.

Also, organic and inorganic interferences, linear concentration range, and detection limits were carefully considered. Furthermore, the analytical application of the method was demonstrated for each metal in biological and/or environmental materials, after optimization of the sample decomposition procedure. Some conclusions : the results obtained by the AdCSV method for the determination of tin in juices agreed reasonably with those obtained by atomic absorption method; the use of the adsorptive voltammetric technique after dry-ashing and UV treatment of the samples was successfully demonstrated for the determination of vanadium in standard reference materials such as urban particulate matter, peach leaves, apple leaves and bovine liver; and, the use of the adsorptive stripping voltammetric technique, after decomposition of samples by dry-ashing and UV treatment, was successfully demonstrated for the determination of molybdenum in peach leaves, apple leaves and bovine liver samples.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adsorptive</field><field name="subject">stripping</field><field name="subject">voltammetry</field><field name="subject">trace elements</field><field name="subject">film</field><field name="subject">metals</field><field name="subject">electrolyte</field><field name="subject">electrode</field><field name="subject">leaves</field><field name="subject">juices</field><field name="subject">lead</field><field name="subject">tin</field><field name="subject">surface</field><field name="subject">molybdenum</field><field name="subject">vanadium</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ambivalent skin of language</field><field name="creator">O'Loughlin, Antoinette</field><field name="description">The position of the maternal body within patriarchy is the topic of this discussion where, rather than looking at a linear sequence of events, various aspects of this position are explored. On an individual level, the intrusion of the father into the dyadic, and potentially incestuous mother-child relationship, marks the entry of the child into the Symbolic Order, and this reflects the mythical account of creation in the Old Testament, where actual maternity is repressed in favour of a paternal monopoly in creation. Just as monotheism both represses and appropriates many aspects of the goddess cult which preceded it and which it replaces, the maternal body is repressed and appropriated within patriarchy. The acquisition of language and awareness of sexual difference marking entry into the 'Law of the Father,' are constructed on a duality of self and other, a dichotomy of inside and outside with a border, represented by the skin, separating the two. This border, separating the symbolic from its other is tenuous and ambiguous, for it is not entirely impermeable barrier. What seeps across this border, what transgresses the barrier between inside and outside, is considered by Kristeva to be abject. Positioned at the threshold separating inside and outside, abjection is the threat of the ever present, but submerged mother crossing the threshold and disrupting social order.

Several studies have demonstrated that copper oxide films, which are normal corrosion products, protect copper substrate from further corrosion. However, little work has been carried out on the chemical formation of copper oxide films. On the other hand, the development of new polymer coatings is needed for corrosion prevention in aggressive environment. Although interest in the use of polypyrrole films for corrosion prevention has arisen recently, no successful utilisation of the polymer for control of copper corrosion has been reported, due to the difficulty in the deposition of the polymer. In this study, two new surface modification techniques, namely chemical formation of copper oxide films and the electrodeposition of polypyrrole on copper, have been developed to address the above issues. The influence of bicarbonate ions on the stability of copper oxide films and pitting corrosion were studied. Various approaches for the electrodeposition of polypyrrole (PPy) film onto copper substrate were investigated. The characteristics and properties of PPy films, particularly for the film formed in sodium tetraborate solution, were investigated. The redox reactions of copper substrate were inhibited completely by the presence of the polypyrrole film, formed in sodium tetraborate solution, in several weak alkaline solutions. The electrochemical behaviour of the Cu-PPy electrode is quite similar to Cu electrode in the presence of an effective corrosion inhibitor, such as benzotriazole, in several solutions. These properties of the PPy film clearly indicate that there is potential for the application of the polymer in the control of copper corrosion.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">copper</field><field name="subject">corrosion</field><field name="subject">film</field><field name="subject">electrodeposition</field><field name="subject">inhibit</field><field name="subject">polypyrrole</field><field name="subject">solution</field><field name="subject">oxide</field><field name="subject">polymer</field><field name="subject">surface</field><field name="subject">carbon</field><field name="subject">sodium</field><field name="subject">electrochemical</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inter- and intraspecific variation in Pisolithus from central and eastern mainland Australia</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Ian C.</field><field name="description">Pisolithus is an important ectomycorrhizal genus world-wide, however to date we remain largely ignorant of the genetic and functional variation that exists within isolates of this genus. Fifty-three isolates of Pisolithus were obtained from various locations in central and eastern Australia and genetic variation within the isolates was assessed using ITS-RFLP and ITS sequencing analyses. RFLP analysis initially grouped the isolates into eight RFLP types. Neighbour-joining analysis of ITS sequences with Pisolithus ITS sequences available in databases clustered the majority of isolates into four groups within two major clades, each comprising isolates of similar basidiospre characteristics. Most Australian isolates correspond with recent provisional descriptions of P. albus or P. marmoratus. One isolate (LJ30) had low sequence identity (61.6-78.0%) to the other isolates and probably represents a separate undescribed Australian species. Significant intraspecific variation was observed in ITS-RFLP profiles for the putative P. albus isolates, suggesting that the sole use of RFLP analysis in diversity assessment may over-estimate Pisolithus species richness. Investigations were also initiated to identify if a relationship exists between genetic and physiological diversity in Australian Pisolithus. It is, however, clear that extensive physiological variation exists in Australian Pisolithus isolates. The size and distribution of genets of Australian Pisolithus species I and II ( putative P. albus and P. marmoratus) was also assessed using microsatellite-primed PCR to gain a better understanding of the likely distribution of underground mycelial networks and possible reproduction strategies in native soils. The data demonstrate that both species have the ability to be long-lived and extend for significant distances in native soils in undisturbed conditions.

In combination with the changes in family structure mothers are increasingly seeking professional support and assistance in the care of their infants and children. Child and family health services in NSW offer varying levels of professional support and education, including 24-hour residential care. The purpose of this study is to explore and describe the mothers' perceptions and experiences of residential admission to a Child and Family Health Unit - Karitane. This study is descriptive in nature. Sixteen English speaking mothers admitted to Karitane in 1998 took part in the study. Focus groups were the main source of data for the study. The focus groups were undirected, conversations recorded and written notes taken. Additional data were collected by a questionnaire to determine the demographic characteristics of the mothers. The mothers' indicators of depression were scored using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Each mother completed the EPDS during the admission period and at the time of the focus and respective comparison was made. Data analysis revealed that the mothers' EDPS scores had decreased significantly at the time of the focus group meeting. The key concepts that emerged in the mothers' descriptions of their experiences were the importance of the development of the professional relationship, equity and access to parenting services, particularly for the partner, and the need for services to promote and provide realistic parenting education with an early intervention focus. The implications of the findings lend support to health care professionals in lobbying government for the necessary funds, in providing increased access to quality parenting services.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mothers</field><field name="subject">baby</field><field name="subject">babies</field><field name="subject">residential</field><field name="subject">postnatal depression</field><field name="subject">Karitane</field><field name="subject">focus group</field><field name="subject">parenting</field><field name="subject">demographic</field><field name="subject">professional support</field><field name="subject">infant</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A multimedia system to instruct novice users of online library catalogues</field><field name="creator">Evans, Paul</field><field name="description">The research reported here focuses on the application of multimedia to the teaching of information skills in academic libraries.

The ways in which novices approach using library-based information technologies which may be applied to any instructional programme for teaching novices how to use library-based information technologies. The research project has involved the development of a comprehensive multimedia system based on the theoretical model. The multimedia system was designed using Macromedia Director v.4.04. The production techniques and operation of the multimedia system are described in some detail. The multimedia system was evaluated and tested using formative evaluation strategies. The evaluation involved the prototype system being reviewed by expert librarians, and multimedia producers, as well as novice users of online library catalogues. The information gathered during the evaluation was used to make suggestions about improvements to the design of the prototype. The results of the evaluation are reported and analysed.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multimedia</field><field name="subject">macromedia</field><field name="subject">librarians</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">information skills</field><field name="subject">academic libraries</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A question of equality : women and women's art under patriarchal society</field><field name="creator">Kim, Gumsun</field><field name="description">In the past and present the inter-gender relationship has been based on male domination resulting in the overlooking of the female role and value. Many male-inspired theories helped to establish this hierarchical relationship and to perpetuate the belief that men and women have been created differently and not equally privileged. My research on the status of Korean women verifies these theories by examining how much social and cultural conditions have contributed to the difference between the genders to the disadvantage of women. It also reveals the distortion of patriarchal theories by investigating the principle of Confucianism which led to the depravation of Korean women's opportunities to develop themselves. The present level of achievement for women's equality is the result of these women's struggles. I as a women artist, present my work so that it will help both men and women to raise their awareness and to eliminate the prejudice towards females in society. The early principle of the Yin and Yang, distorted later for political benefits, implied a cooperative relationship of two forces for creation and development. Although these force are different and independent, when used cooperatively, they make a complete picture of stability and harmony. If they remain separate forces there is no resulting completion of creation, but instability and misfortunes. By disclosing this principle of harmony in Shamanism and early Confucianism, I also present the notion that all kinds of misfortunes come out of a broken harmony between creatures, peoples, and genders.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">equality</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">role</field><field name="subject">value</field><field name="subject">male domination</field><field name="subject">Korean</field><field name="subject">status</field><field name="subject">artist</field><field name="subject">yin</field><field name="subject">yang</field><field name="subject">prejudice</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radiotherapy x-ray dosage distribution in lung and air cavities</field><field name="creator">Wong, Tony Po Yin</field><field name="description">The effect of lateral electron disequilibrium on patient dose has been investigated.

Using a thimble ionization chamber, a Markus ionization chamber and TLDs the problems of central axis dose reduction and penumbral flaring in lung for x-rays have been investigated. It is found that the ETAR correction predicts the dose at mid lung with varying degrees of accuracy depending on the field size.

This project investigates the functional and developmental aspects of T-cell responses in the marsupial, Macropus eugenii (Tammar wallaby) in both adults and pouch young at various stages of development. Determination of the age at which the Tammar wallaby immune system becomes competent has been examined through the use of cellular and molecular studies carried out on developing pouch young tissue. The capacity for generating an immunological response in adult and pouch young marsupials has been studied by following cellular proliferation in response to mitogens or mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC). After examining adult responses to mitogens and allogenic lymphocytes, optimised conditions were then used to examine the development of responsiveness in pouch young. Several further tests were conducted and findings shown. The study has shown that the earliest age at which Macropus eugenii is capable of mounting a T-cell mediated immune response is between 5 to 13 days post-partum</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">Macropus eugenii</field><field name="subject">wallaby</field><field name="subject">immune response</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sound art and the annihilation of sound</field><field name="creator">Davies, Shaun</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the way in which sound is taken up and subsequently suppressed within the visual arts. The idealisation and development of sound as a plastic material is able to be traced within the modernist trajectory, which, reflecting a set of cultural practices and having developed its own specific terminologies, comes to regard any material, or anything conceived of as material, as appropriate and adequate to the expression of its distinctive and guiding concepts and metaphors. These concepts and metaphors are discussed as already having at their bases strongly visualist biases, the genealogies of which are traced within traditional or formal philosophies. Here, the marginalising tendency of ocularcentrism is exposed, but the very nature and contingency of marginalisation is found to work for the sound artist (where the perpetuation of the mythologised 'outsider' figure is desired) but against sound which is positioned in a purely differential and negative relation. In this epistemological and ontological reduction, sound becomes simply a visual metaphor or metonymic contraction which forecloses the possibility of producing other ways of articulating its experience or of producing any markedly alternative 'readings'. Rather than simply attempting to reverse the hierarchisation of the visual over the aural, or of prefacing sound within a range of artistic practices (each which would keep the negative tradition going) sound's ambiguous relation to the binarism of presence/absence, system and margin, is, however oddly, elaborated. The strategy which attempts to suspend sound primarily within and under the mark of the concept is interrogated and its limits exposed. The sound artist, the 'margin surfer' is revealed as a perhaps deeply conservative figure who may in the end desire the suppression of sound, and who, actually rejecting any destabilising and threatening notion of 'radical alterity' anxiously clings to the 'marginalised' modernist pretence. It is the main contention of this thesis that the marginalisation of sound obscures the more pressing question of its ambiguous relation to notions of sameness and difference, and that its conceptualisation suppresses the question of the ethical. That the ethical question should (and always does) take 'precedence' over purely epistemological and ontological considerations, and that more genuinely open attitudes should be assumed with respect to sound studies are forwarded in this thesis</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ocularcentrism</field><field name="subject">Heidegger</field><field name="subject">metaphysics</field><field name="subject">sound art</field><field name="subject">epistemology</field><field name="subject">ontology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuous degradation of phenol at low levels using Pseudomonas putida immobilised in calcium alginate</field><field name="creator">Mordocco, Angela Maria</field><field name="description">Biodegradation is the breakdown of a compound by a biological organism. Over the past few decades, the biodegradation of compounds such as phenol has been researched extensively. Phenol research has shown that certain organisms are capable of utilising it as an energy source, and a variety of methods are available for its removal. Unfortunately, there is lack of research on phenol degradation at low concentrations. The majority of research performed on phenol degradation has used concentrations above 500 mg, while phenol is highly toxic at levels below 25 mg. The aim of this research was to pursue the problem of phenol degradation at below 100 mg and develop a system able to degrade phenol at such levels. The system consisted of a bioreactor developed to run in continuous mode, using Ps. putida immobilised in calcium alginate. A standard method was modified to quantitatively analyze effluent phenol levels, and a medium designed to increase the longevity of calcium alginate beads in continuous culture. A continuous flow bioreactor was also designed using an overflow weir for use with immobilised cells. Based on the results obtained, immobilisation offers increased stability and increased protection for cells under extreme conditions and is able to use higher dilution rates than cells under continuous culture</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biodegradation</field><field name="subject">phenol</field><field name="subject">low concentrations</field><field name="subject">bioreactor</field><field name="subject">calcium alginate</field><field name="subject">dilution</field><field name="subject">stability</field><field name="subject">cells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/42</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Youth generated cultures in Western Sydney</field><field name="creator">Forrester, Linda</field><field name="description">The study focuses on the types of cultural practice that are, in the main, generated by the young people themselves (hereafter referred to as youth generated cultures) who fall within the age group of 14-20 yrs of age. The research was undertaken in the Western Sydney region, which is the largest expanding population in Australia, and is regularly defined as a socio-economically disadvantaged region, therefore, an important factor within this study is the issue of class determinants. The paper explores the youth generated cultural practice of graffiti, skateboarding, street machining, and street dancing. These creative practices challenge traditional notions of culture and the arts, however the young people also employ strategies of an aesthetic nature in their creative process. Youth generated cultures are actively engaged in criticism through the use of instrumentalist aesthetics such as Monroe Beardsley describes. The thesis proposes that youth generated cultures have, in a united and structured manner, provided for themselves a framework of economic and pedagogical support that has afforded them a place within the cultural mainstream without the recognition or approval of mainstream cultural establishments. It is argued that these particular youth generated cultures are not rebellious or destructive subcultures, that they are creative in nature and have been established primarily to produce and display their creative cultures. Youth agency is essential to the character of these youth generated cultures and it is this agency that is under challenge from the cultural hegemony. The young people involved in youth generated cultures demand that any account of their cultural practice must also accept the agency of youth as fundamental to their cultural status.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">youth</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">economic</field><field name="subject">pedagogical</field><field name="subject">graffiti</field><field name="subject">skateboarding</field><field name="subject">street dancing</field><field name="subject">creative process</field><field name="subject">Western Sydney</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Apollonian to Dionysiac : a paper on Nietzsche's division of culture into two principal strains.

When Nietzsche wrote the 'Birth of Tragedy' in 1872, from which his division of culture emerged, it was entitled 'The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music'. Young (1992), also describes music as 'The Dionysian art' in his book 'Nietzsche's Philosophy of Art'. With consideration to changes in art and perception between the latter nineteenth and the twentieth century, a stronger argument for the inclusion of painting as 'a Dionysian art', can be formed. The author also analyses the metaphysical in art and through an examination of the nature of the Dionysiac as described in religious rites as opposed to varying analysis from Nitzsche and his critics</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">metaphysics in art</field><field name="subject">painting</field><field name="subject">modern (20 th Century)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/464</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The changing role of Home Economics education in primary schools in contemporary Thai society</field><field name="creator">Jaroenkornburi, Sumonchat</field><field name="description">This study investigated the changing role of home economics education in primary schools in contemporary Thai society. Two main questions were set to guide the study : What home economics subject matter should be taught in primary schools in contemporary Thai society? How should it be taught? Both qualitative and quantitative methodologies were employed. A qualitative research approach was used in collecting data from several sources, including published documents relevant to home economics education in Thai primary schools and those relevant to Thai society during the period 1960-2000; observations of Thai primary school Housework classrooms during the 1997-1998 academic year; and interviews with prominent Thai home economists, primary school principals and Housework teachers, and involved parents of primary school children. A quantitative research approach was used to examine the perceptions of home economics education in Thai primary schools of the Housework teachers, and to examine the lifestyles of Thai primary school children. Expectations about the changing role of home economics education in Thai primary schools were investigated. It was concluded that the role of home economics needs to shift from a technical skills orientation to a practical problem solving emphasis. According to this new role, home economics education in Thai primary schools will not only provide for the children's technical skills but also provide an opportunity to develop a group of life skills, namely- critical thinking, decision making, individual/family resource management, and problem solving. Through the acquisition of these life skills children will be better equipped to manage their everyday life in a rapidly changing Thai society. Finally, based on its major conclusions, the study draws implications for future action by several groups of stakeholders (policy makers, curriculum developers, teacher educators, personnel in schools, and professional associations) required to bring about important changes in home economics education in Thai primary schools</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thai society</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">perceptions</field><field name="subject">home economics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cosmic shopping</field><field name="creator">Flanagan, Josephine M.</field><field name="description">This novel is about Jess, a left wing trade unionist and student lawyer who, caught up in a fast-paced Sydney inner city life, goes to a hypnotist in an effort to drink less and instead has an experience of God.

The data includes surveys of child-care staff and students enrolled in child-care courses, interviews with child-care staff, union officials and employer representatives, and official documentation. While child-care workers report high levels of job satisfaction, it is argued that the considerable &#8216;exit voice&#8217; of the survey respondents is a demonstration of job dissatisfaction. The reported levels of satisfaction are a manifestation of satisfaction with the intrinsic features of the work (child development outcomes) and the limited employment opportunities of females generally. The exit voice is a manifestation of dissatisfaction with the extrinsic features of the job (pay and career advancement). The thesis failed to detect evidence of a strong relationship between job (dis)satisfaction and union membership, due to the &#8216;caring profession syndrome&#8217;, a perceived lack of union instrumentality, and problems associated with the ability of unions to recruit and organise an industry consisting of over 4,000 small workplaces. The findings show that both staff and students are highly sympathetic towards unions, that working in child-care changes attitudes about work but not unions, and that there exists a strong union voice among child-care workers despite the relative low levels of union membership. The thesis discusses the implications for union organisation so that the supply of union membership might correspond with the demands for this membership, particularly in regard to employee motivations and commitments.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child care workers</field><field name="subject">trade union membership</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On formal specification of authorization policies and their transformations : thesis</field><field name="creator">Bai, Yun</field><field name="description">Most of today's information systems are quite complex and often involve multi-user resource-sharing. In such a system, authorization policies are needed to ensure that the information flows in the desired way and to prevent illegal access to the system resource. Overall, authorization policies provide the ability to limit and control accesses to systems, applications and information. These policies need to be updated to capture the changing requirements of applications, systems and users. These updatings are implemented through the transformation of authorization policies. In this thesis, the author proposes a logic based formal approach to specifying authorization policies and to reason about the transformation and sequence of transformations of authorization policies and its application in object oriented databases. The author defines the structure of the policy transformation and employs model-based semantics to perform the transformation under the principle of minimum change. The language is modified to consider a sequence of authorization policy transformations. It handles more complex transformations and solves certain problems. The language is able to represent incomplete information, default authorizations and allows denials to be expressed explicitly. The proposed language is used to specify a variety of well known access control policies such as static separation of duty, dynamic separation of duty and Chinese wall security policy. The authorization formalization is also applied to object oriented databases.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">systems</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">access</field><field name="subject">object oriented</field><field name="subject">database</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">semantics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/564</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of abstract and figurative images to evoke emotive qualities characteristic of women's sexuality</field><field name="creator">Murray, Kendal, 1958-</field><field name="description">This research paper examines the implications of a feminist appropriation of the fetish and the use of the theory of abjection, as a disruption of phallocentric binary labelling and its notion of idealised femininity.

These issues revolve around the creation of multiple subject positions for women as both artist and spectator, the recuperation of the seductive image without creating the same power relations apparent in the male gaze and the deployment of an abstract visual femininity to scopically seduce the viewer.

It discusses the dilemmas facing DNR patients and their nurses and explores the solutions to these dilemmas offered by Watson's theory. Traditional nursing practice places the nurse in a difficult situation by focusing on physical health. The report discusses the philosophical assumptions underlying Watson's theory. These assumptions led Watson to focus on nursing holistically, and to emphasise an integrated approach to nursing, which promotes the comfort of the patient physically, spiritually and emotionally. Her focus is on the broader aspects of caring such as involving the care domain of nursing, instead of the narrower view of nursing which focuses on care for the 'cure' only. This appproach is particularly relevant to DNR situations because these situations involve patients for whom there is no physical cure. Watson's holistic approach to caring offers the nurses of DNR patients guidelines for their practice and meaning for their nursing actions. Because current DNR decisions are often made by medical officers but implemented by nurses, it is the nurse who may be legally liable for the patient's death. This can cause anxiety for the nurses involved. Another cause of anxiety can be the traditional focus in nursing on physical cure. In the care of DNR patients, no such cure is possible. This can leave the nurse feeling distressed and incompetent. DNR the patients, may lack of autonomy and suffer feelings of insecurity. It is in these areas that Watson's ten carative factors can offer support, for both patients and nurses.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nurse</field><field name="subject">patients</field><field name="subject">DNR</field><field name="subject">resuscitate</field><field name="subject">guidelines</field><field name="subject">Watson</field><field name="subject">surgical</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/672</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Twenty-four miles around Nelungaloo : the history and importance of cinema exhibition in pre-television times to a country area of central-western New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Cork, Kevin James</field><field name="description">Little research into historical, architectural and social significance of the picture theatre in pre-television rural Australian society has been undertaken.

The main emphasis is on finding the reasons for the process of ethnic business creation over time, focusing on the ethnic resources that the intending ethnic business operators bring to such activities through links to their country of origin. This is a resource-based study, which looks at ethnic resources as a means of sustained competitive advantage and as strategy for success in ethnic business operations in Australia. It attempts to gauge the extent of interactive processes between business operations and the relevant ethnic resources, some of which have a great influence in determining ethnic business people&#8217;s success. Policies aimed directly at facilitating, encouraging and strengthening these processes would be a valuable development. This research also examines the theories of small business development and identifies their applicability and relevance to the development of ethnic small business in Australia. The findings of this study enabled the development of a new theory and model for ethnic business creation that links the creation and success of ethnic small businesses to the use of productive diversity principles.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">productive diversity model</field><field name="subject">new business enterprises</field><field name="subject">minority business enterprises</field><field name="subject">business success</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dreaming tracks : history of the Aboriginal Islander Skills Development Scheme, 1972-1979 : its place in the continuum</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Raymond Stanley</field><field name="description">Dreaming Tracks was chosen for the title of this history because of its reference to the journeys and routes taken by the ancestral founders of each of the extended family clans. As they travelled they recorded the events and situations they encountered along the way , which they left in story, painting, song lines and dances for the future survival of their people. The history of the Aboriginal/Islander Skills Development Scheme also pertains to a journey. This journey records the events that brought about the establishment of the longest surviving, urban Indigenous dance organization. It's a voyage that identifies the obstacles and accomplishments of its founding members, who dedicated themselves to the hard work to ensure the continuum of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander dance. It was their dream, to have an Australian Black Dance Company that would create a link between past and present, traditional and urban. The pathways they created equipped urban Indigenous Australians with a unique dance identity of their own, and established the path to continued contact with the traditional owners. Dreaming Tracks is contemporary Dreaming lore that begins with the contention for land rights in the early 1970's and follows the progress of the Aboriginal/Islander Skills Development Scheme to the end of the decade. It records the desires, dreams and conflicts that brought this organization into being. In parallel, the concerns of the founder, Carole Y. Johnson, sets the path for the journey, which by the end of the twentieth-century witnessed the establishment of an accredited dance course, two dance companies (The Aboriginal/Islander Dance Theatre and Bangarra Dance Theatre, Australia) and students who are key participants in the artistic design of the 2000 Olympics in Sydney Australia</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dreaming</field><field name="subject">dance</field><field name="subject">indigenous</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">course</field><field name="subject">traditional dance</field><field name="subject">contemporary dance</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal</field><field name="subject">Torres Strait Islander</field><field name="subject">Carole Y.

A dissatisfaction with the interpretive power of dominant paradigms regarding parents' responses to their children with disabilities resulted in a study in which an interpretive methodology, informed by phenomenology, was used. The voices of six parents paint a picture which is at odds with prevalent assumptions of parental crisis and maladjustment. Whilst being conscious of their anguish and sorrow, these parents speak of hope, love, strength and joy. An interpretation of the parents' experience is presented in light of the themes of 'between joy and sorrow', 'hope and no hope' and 'defiance and despair'.

Longum plants, but the timing of flower production was less affected. The use of different plant establishment techniques modified flower production. Bare rooted transplants slowed the rate of flower production in comparison with direct seeded plants or those established from cell tray transplants. Bare rooted transplants delayed the onset of water stress. The capabilities of male and female gametophytes were reduced by water stress, with the female more affected, and the interaction of male and female gametophytes was affected by moderate water stress. Moderate water stress increased the time to fruit set, but affected neither the number nor percentage of fruit set, whereas severe water stress increased the time and reduced the number and percentage. Severe water stress reduced the number and percentage of mature fruit, fruit quality indices and total fruit yield. Moderate water stress reduced the number of seeds per fruit and fruit dry weight, but total fresh weight yield was not significantly affected. The time to fruit set was negatively correlated with the quality indices of mature fruit, whereas the number of seeds was positively correlated with the same. Fertilisation determined the success of seed set, and the rapidity of fruit set. Successful fertilisation can only occur when the pollen tube arrives at a viable ovule. The processes of pollen tube growth and longevity of the ovule are the factors most critically affected by water stress in determining the yield of C. annuum Longum.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chilli peppers</field><field name="subject">Capsicum annuum Longum</field><field name="subject">water requirements of plants</field><field name="subject">effect of soil moisture on plants</field><field name="subject">plant-water relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/82</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The chemistry and biochemistry of melon fruit development and quality</field><field name="creator">Wang, You Ming</field><field name="description">A number of methods for the analysis of free amino acids in melon fruit have been evaluated experimentally. Analysis of their tBDMS derivatives by GC (gas chromatography) was found to be the most suitable for the mix of free amino acid found in the melon matrix. It affords good yields of amino acid derivatives with excellent gas chromatographic properties and characteristic mass spectra. The single-step derivatization procedure is highly reproducible and allows simultaneous analysis of asparagine and glutamine together with their corresponding acids. Changes in amino acids, sugars, the principal acids, volatiles and minerals in the free form were studied in the fruit mesocarp during development, ripening and storage of the fruits. Sucrose was the principal sugar, absent in young fruit but showing a dramatic increase during ripening while the levels of fructose and glucose remained constant during the whole course of fruit growth or slightly decreased during ripening and storage. The quantitative determination of 22 free amino acids was achieved by GC analysis using the method developed. Total aroma volatiles were determined using a headspace-gas chromatographic technique. They increased and reached a maximum value just before fruit full slip. Most of the esters characteristic of melon aroma were absent in young fruit but developed at the ripening stage. Changes in the quantities of mineral nutrients present in the fruits were determined by ICP-AES analysis. The concentrations of most elements increased thoughout the fruit development except for Ca which decreased markedly and Cu which decreased during early growth then fluctuated around lower values later in the development stage. All of the above changes can be related to the metabolic activity during fruit growth and maturation. Statistical analysis showed changes in TV, TSS, TS, pH, some free amino acids and some minerals were strongly correlated.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">melon</field><field name="subject">fruit</field><field name="subject">aroma</field><field name="subject">volatiles</field><field name="subject">alcohol</field><field name="subject">gas</field><field name="subject">chromatography</field><field name="subject">esters</field><field name="subject">derivatives</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="subject">mass</field><field name="subject">ripening</field><field name="subject">amino acids</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">minerals</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/86</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diet and self-care in Pakistani diabetic patients</field><field name="creator">Sheikh, Mona Hanif</field><field name="description">Two hundred non-insulin dependent diabetic patients, predominantly from three health facilities in Lahore, Pakistan were assessed for metabolic control, weight status, diabetes knowledge, and six areas of diabetes self-care activities as well as dietary intake.

A number of electrochemical, chemical, metallographic and physical techniques were employed in this study. The choice of stainless steels, test solutions and methods of investigations was based on scientific expediency and practical availability. For the first time in electrochemical and corrosion characteristics of passivation, local anodic depassivation and pitting corrosion of stainless steels were obtained in thin layers and compared with those in bulk electrolytes. It was demonstrated that the thickness of the electrolyte layer can influence the passivation process and, under certain conditions, the kinetics of pitting erosion. Several tests were conducted and results given. It was shown that the prognosis of corrosion behaviour of some stainless steels in sulphur dioxide contaminated atmosphere based on electrochemical measurements in bulk electrolytes can be erroneous. The same measurements carried out in thin phase layers enable more accurate prediction. However, the prognosis of the relative resistance of the stainless steels to pitting corrosion in the clean chloride-containing atmosphere may be based on conventional electrochemical measurements in the bulk of corresponding electrolytes</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stainless steel corrosion</field><field name="subject">electrolytes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/798</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Promoting the 'good' relationship : recognising moral dimensions in violence prevention education</field><field name="creator">Evans, Susan P.</field><field name="description">This thesis reports a phenomenological hermeneutical critical realist inquiry into violence prevention educators promoting desirable and &#8216;good&#8217; relationships in practice. This inquiry is based on the premise that promoting desirable alternatives to violence in violence prevention education is a moral activity; in so far as the question of what is desirable in relationships is a moral question. Based on in-depth phenomenological interviews with twelve Australian human service professionals working in the field of primary relationship violence prevention, the thesis provides descriptions of how and why certain versions of desirable relationships are promoted in this field. It will be demonstrated that individual workers&#8217; personal moral commitments are influential in making certain versions of the &#8216;good&#8217; relationship possible in violence prevention education. The field of primary violence prevention has a dual function; the first is to ameliorate risks associated with using violence, and the second is to promote desirable alternatives to using violence in relationships. This thesis argues that when workers in violence prevention education promote desirable ways of being in relationships they are promoting moral goods. Few fields in human service work offer an inquirer direct access to the issue of promoting moral goods in practice. The focus of most human services practice is less about the question of the good or flourishing life, and more about assisting people to cope with or change existing social and personal problems. In contrast, violence prevention education is bound up with constructing and promoting desirable human living. In this inquiry the conceptual task was to understand and describe the interplay between individual workers beliefs and practice style when doing violence prevention education. The thesis identifies four different conventions of this interplay. In two conventions, there was a tendency for workers not to recognise or avoid recognising the moral complexities involved when promoting good alternatives to using violence in relationships. These workers use an &#8216;expert&#8217; or prescriptive practice approach. In the third convention workers recognised there is moral and ethical complexity in the practice of promoting desirable relationships. These workers conceive that practicing well in the field of violence prevention education is less about promoting certainty and prescription, and more with posing ethical questions. In the fourth convention was observed inconsistencies between workers&#8217; personal beliefs and how they construct desirable relationships in the public realm of practice. These workers conceal aspects of their personal beliefs because these beliefs sit uncomfortably with secular values, or otherwise dominant cultural norms in the field. Hermeneutical engagement with the field findings accommodated the literary tradition of human service work ethics, the moral philosophy tradition in so far as it has addressed the question of what makes a human practice &#8216;good&#8217;, and interpersonal violence prevention literature. Interpretation of these literary traditions was underscored by a &#8216;strong&#8217; hermeneutical framework (Taylor 1989; Gadamer 1976; Heidegger 1962), combined with elements from transcendental critical realism (Archer 2004; 2003; 2000). The interpretations given in the thesis are evaluative. I argue that that promoting desirable relationships in violence prevention education should be recognised as a practice with implicit ethical and moral dimensions. Based on this recognition, I argue that workers in this field must demonstrate a broader range of ethical skills. Workers should be able to recognise and engage purposefully with a variety of moral traditions that people in the community draw upon to evaluate what is &#8216;good&#8217; in human living. I argue that it is important for violence prevention educators to develop moral understanding, a personal moral commitment, and a capacity for skilful engagement with groups concerning ethical dilemmas in human living.  This thesis can make a contribution to that tradition in human services literature where scholars and practitioners have engaged the problem of how to conceive &#8216;ethical&#8217; practice. However, the final contribution of this thesis will be perhaps less with the findings discussed and more with observing that moral dimensions in the field of violence prevention education have not been adequately recognised.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">violence</field><field name="subject">family violence</field><field name="subject">interpersonal conflict</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">social service</field><field name="subject">moral and ethical aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/39296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The psychodynamic body : a mythos of psychotherapy</field><field name="creator">Hueneke, Anna</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploration of the psychodynamic body and its mythos. I take a phenomenological approach to research that remains connected to lived experience. I begin with image making, painting from the subjective body in response to the ancient Mesopotamian myth of the flood and archaic cultural material on the flood theme. I discover a relationship between this imagery, this mythos, and earlier work on the Dionysian mythology and mysteries. I gather these images together and with work on my own family history I create a painting performance titled Wings from the Deep. The mythos, the poetic structure, of this performance and this thesis, is an exploration of how a people, a person, a body, can journey through traumatic states. The core phenomenon of this thesis is the psychodynamic movement from deadness to aliveness, a movement at the heart of the psychotherapeutic process. I apply knowledge of the psychotherapeutic conversation to the research process by writing to an important other, Etty Hillesum, a young Dutch Jewish woman who wrote a series of diaries during the Holocaust. I then link this conversation with my earlier imagery and the images of the Holocaust to the biblical myth of the flood. This linking of somatic states to mythic material through imagery and text is how I develop the poetic language integral to this thesis. I create a constant dialogue from body to image to word, a process, a language, that mirrors psychotherapy. The psychodynamic body structures the mythos of this thesis. The psychodynamic body structures a mythos of psychotherapy.

The results indicate that there was no significant difference in the variance and in the change of variance over time of the amplitude between the two groups when the participants were walking. However when the participants were running, there was a significant difference in the two cohorts. While there was an increase in the total variance over the duration of the exercise for both the groups, the increase in variance of the LBP group was much greater (order of ten times) compared with the participants with healthy backs. The difference between the two groups was also very significant when observing the change of variance over the duration of the exercise. From these results, it is suggested that variance of sEMG of the muscles of the lower back, recorded when the participants are running, can be used to identify LBP patients.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">surface electromyogram</field><field name="subject">gait analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090713.115553</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A terroir of terroir (or, a brief history of design-places).</field><field name="creator">Blythe, Richard John</field><field name="description">This PhD provides insight into designing.

There can be little doubt that this has brought significant change to the nature of what is expected of people occupying positions of leadership in schools and educational institutions (Ball, 2007; Bottery, 2004; Codd, 2005). Against this contextual backdrop, and in the researcher&#8217;s experience as a teacher and former holder of a position of leadership, there is an observable phenomenon of educational leaders stepping aside from position and yet continuing to work as teachers within the same workplace. Despite claims of a leadership &#8216;crisis&#8217;, and international acknowledgement of concern over the retention of educational leaders (Brooking, 2007; Brundrett &amp; Rhodes, 2006; Fullan, 2005), the human experience of this phenomenon appears unrepresented in current research literature. The present study has sought to capture this experience through addressing the central research question &#8220;What is the lived experience of the voluntary relinquishing of the position of leader, yet choosing to remain within the same educational workplace?&#8221; In order to gather rich qualitative data, a descriptive multiple case study design was employed. In-depth unstructured interviews were carried out with eight educational leaders who had relinquished position within the contexts of New Zealand State Secondary Schools and Private Training Establishments, and chosen to continue working in these same contexts. The subsequent analysis drew on the tradition of hermeneutic interpretation (van Manen, 1990) to arrive at interpretations of the uniqueness of individual experiences, and offer understandings of the shared meanings of the experience in the form of essential themes. The key findings which emerged in this study were those of a sense of the &#8216;a-lone-ness&#8217; of leadership, the &#8216;ready-suddenness&#8217; of the decision to step aside, a seeking of &#8216;balance&#8217; in the relinquishing of position, a powerful sense of &#8216;re-turning&#8217; to the call of teaching, and varying degrees of &#8216;ease&#8217; and &#8216;dis-ease&#8217; in the experience of &#8216;letting go and holding on&#8217; following positional relinquishment. These findings serve to extend aspects of those of earlier leadership and role exit studies, and offer previously undocumented understandings. Thus, a major contribution of this study is in the bringing-to-voice of the stories of those who step aside from leadership position yet remain in the workplace, and in the opening of avenues for further research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational leadership</field><field name="subject">Lived experience</field><field name="subject">Role exit</field><field name="subject">Succession</field><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="subject">Hermeneutic phenomenology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/676</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of irrigation on growth and nitrogen accumulation of Kabuli chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) and narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.)</field><field name="creator">Kang, Sideth</field><field name="description">A field experiment was conducted to examine the responses in growth, total dry matter (TDM), seed yield and nitrogen (N) accumulation of Kabuli chickpea cv. Principe and narrow-leafed lupin cv. Fest to different irrigation levels and N fertilizer on a Templeton silt loam soil at Lincoln University, Canterbury, New Zealand in 2007/08. The irrigation and fertilizer treatments were double full irrigation, full irrigation, half irrigation and nil irrigation and a control, full irrigation plus 150 kg N ha&#8315;&#185;. There was a 51 % increase in the weighed mean absolute growth rate (WMAGR) by full irrigation over no irrigation. The maximum growth rates (MGR) followed a similar response. The growth rates were not significantly decreased by double irrigation. Further, N fertilizer did not significantly improve crop growth rates. With full irrigation MGRs were 27.6 and 34.1 g m&#8315;&#178; day&#8315;&#185; for Kabuli chickpea and narrow-leafed lupin, respectively. Seed yields of fully-irrigated crops were trebled over the nil irrigation treatment. With full irrigation, seed yield of chickpea was 326 and that of lupin was 581 g m&#8315;&#178;. Seed yield of the two legumes was reduced by 45 % with double irrigation compared with full irrigation. Nitrogen fertilizer did not increase seed yields in either legume. Increased seed yield with full irrigation was related to increased DM, and crop growth rates, seeds pod&#8315;&#185; and seeds m&#8315;&#178;. Crop harvest index (CHI) was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased by irrigation and was related to seed yield only in narrow-leafed lupin. With full irrigation, the crops intercepted more than 95 % of incoming incident radiation at leaf area indices (LAIs), 2.9 and 3 or greater in Kabuli chickpea and narrow-leafed lupin, respectively. In contrast, without irrigation the two legumes achieved a maximum fraction of radiation intercepted of less than 90 %. With full irrigation, total intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was increased by 28 % and 33 % over no irrigation for Kabuli chickpea and narrow-leafed lupin, respectively. Fully-irrigated Kabuli chickpea intercepted a total amount of PAR of 807 MJ m&#8315;&#178; and fully-irrigated narrow-leafed lupin intercepted 1,042 MJ m&#8315;&#178;. Accumulated DM was strongly related to accumulated intercepted PAR (R&#178; &#8805; 0.96**). The final RUE was significantly (P &lt; 0.001) increased by irrigation. With full irrigation the final RUE of Kabuli chickpea was 1.49 g DM MJ&#8315;&#185; PAR and that of narrow-leafed lupin was 2.17 g DM MJ&#8315;&#185; PAR. Total N accumulation of Kabuli chickpea was not significantly affected by irrigation level. Kabuli chickpea total N was increased by 90 % by N fertilizer compared to fully-irrigated Kabuli chickpea which produced 17.7 g N m&#8315;&#178;. In contrast, total N accumulated in narrow-leafed lupin was not increased by N fertilizer but was decreased by 75 % with no irrigation and by 25 % with double irrigation (water logging) compared to full irrigation with a total N of 45.9 g m&#8315;&#178;. Total N was highly significantly related to TDM (R&#178; = 0.78** for Kabuli chickpea and R&#178; = 0.99** for narrow-leafed lupin). Nitrogen accumulation efficiency (NAE) of narrow-leafed lupin was not affected by irrigation or by N fertilizer.

The robotic mechanism is proposed and its kinematic parameters are defined according to the biomechanical findings and measurements of the human masticatory system. This thesis is concerned with the design and implementation of trajectory tracking control for robotic jaw actuators via Galil motion controller. The aim of this project is to simulate the dynamics behaviour and force-motion control of the robot, and to quantitatively assess food texture changes during chewing. A control system based Galil motion control card has been formed to achieve the motion of simulated human mastication. Some real human mastication motion have been tracked and used as targeted trajectories for the robot to reproduce. Several experiments have been executed to measure the jaw movements and chewing forces. To reduce the vibration of the actuators and protect sensitive linkage part of the robot, the traditional PID control and some advanced control theories were implemented to achieve most effective efforts. A mathematical model was also designed at the first stage when a test actuator powered by brushless motor was formed; however, it is finally proven not well controlled in either mechanical and control ways. Major features of the built robot including the motion control system are presented and tested. Experimental results including free chewing, soft-food and hard-food chewing are given where the foods are simulated by foam and hard objects. Also the joint actuations and driving torques required are compared for the chewing of different foods. In conclusion, tracking motion control has been attempted on the physical robot and a solution to the trajectory control has been developed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">robotics</field><field name="subject">mechatronic chewing robot</field><field name="subject">robotic jaw actuators</field><field name="subject">Galil motion control</field><field name="subject">engineering</field><field name="subject">mechatronics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering::290501 Mechanical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">This is a journey into sound/bring the noise : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Cairns, Gregory John</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to survey the discussions around the position of sound art within the broader arts, and to explore strategies and research areas within fine art and my own practice, so as to identify new areas of enquiry and develop my work within this field.

There is little information regarding Pinel&#8217;s life and work, however, the preface and privil&#232;ge included in her Nouveau recueil provide some clues as to Pinel&#8217;s biography. Her life and music are examined, with reference to the social, literary and musical environment she was working in. An added dimension is that Pinel was working as a professional musicienne at a time when women were beginning to find their voice and place in professional society. Pinel claims authorship of the majority of the poems in her collection, and the rest come from anonymous sources. Pinel&#8217;s literary and musical output illustrates her obvious knowledge of the current trends in eighteenth-century France, with most of her poetry written for a female poetic voice, displaying many of the fashionable themes of the day. Her music displays a variety of styles, ranging from simple airs in binary form, traditionally found in most French airs s&#233;rieux et &#224; boire, to the operatic, and the fashionable rococo styles.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Julie Pinel</field><field name="subject">musicology</field><field name="subject">18th century French poetry</field><field name="subject">18th century French music</field><field name="subject">women composers</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The spectroscopic analysis of di-copper helicates as receptors for encapsulating anions : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Chemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Knapp, Quintin Wayne</field><field name="description">The application of neutral dicopper helicates to the encapsulation of a number of anions was investigated.

In parallel there has emerged an appreciation of the non-economic impact of entrepreneurship on those who enact it. However, there still remains a limited understanding of the consequences of choosing to be an entrepreneur, and what that choice means in terms of that individual&#8217;s life and work. The potential for the young as a group to engage with entrepreneurship as a &#8216;career option&#8217; is high, therefore the central research objective of this study was to learn what meaning young New Zealand entrepreneurs attach to &#8216;being in business&#8217;. The study was grounded in an inductive, interpretive research design, underpinned by the tenets of constructivism. Phenomenologically focussed, in-depth interviews were used to gather data from ten young New Zealand entrepreneurs. These interviews were semi-structured and emphasised language, meaning, and narrative. The resulting data were analysed using elements of a constructivist grounded theory approach. A key finding was that the nature of the relationship between the entrepreneurs and their firms was a strong attachment grounded in emotion. The intertwining of the life of the business with the life of the young entrepreneur was viewed positively, and frequently involved personal transformation. Businesses were more than mechanisms for achieving monetary wealth. The relationship between the young entrepreneurs and their work was also intense. Balance of work and life was not an issue, nor did they seek to differentiate between the two spheres. They were content to have the two blended in a manner of their choosing. Consistent with this was their drive for personal authenticity and adherence to strong ethical imperatives. Being an entrepreneur was less about career (and even less about a job) and more about fulfilling needs of a higher order. Almost all the participants strongly identified as entrepreneurs. They felt it was the identity most consistent with their values, attitudes, and aspirations. They accepted that in some instances the label small-firm owner manager was accurate in terms of the scale of their operations, but rejected its appropriateness on any other grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">personal transformation</field><field name="subject">interviews</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Copigmentation reactions of boysenberry juice : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Food Technology at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jettanapornsumran, Monchanok</field><field name="description">Colour is one of the main sensory characteristics of berry juice and fruit products and this parameter also powerfully impacts on consumer behaviour. However, the colour of berry juices is unstable and degradation occurs during storage. The main objectives of the project were: to determine the mechanism by which boysenberry juice enhances the colour of other berry juices and to determine if its addition to berry juices will also stabilise the anthocyanin pigments and enhance copigmentation. In this study, total anthocyanin, total phenolic acids, hyperchromic and bathochromic shift and the rate of colour degradation was measured by spectrophotometric techniques. Individual anthocyanin and phenolic acid content were measured in each juice by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were evaluated during storage at 5, 20 and 35?C. Boysenberry juice improved the colour of blackcurrant, cranberry and pomegranate juices immediately after addition; however, only blackcurrant juice colour was stable during storage at 5?C. There was no influence on the stability of total anthocyanins in pomegranate or cranberry juices when boysenberry juice was added. Of the three juices, pomegranate had the highest rate of degradation. The total anthocyanin of blackcurrant enhanced with boysenberry juice was more stable than for cranberry and pomegranate juices. The impact of phenolic acids found in boysenberry juice (kaemferol, quercetin and ellagic acid) on blackcurrant juice colour stability was also investigated. The colour stability of blackcurrant juice was improved by the addition of ellagic acid at 5?C; however, the colour intensity of blackcurrant enhanced with kaemferol and quercetin decreased with storage. The copigmentations between anthocyanins themselves were not found to be a significant effect on colour stability of blackcurrant juice. Ellagic acid had the strongest colour improvement in blackcurrant juice compared to boysenberry juice. In conclusion, ellagic acid as found in boysenberry juice formed intermolecular copigmentation with blackcurrant juice anthocyanins, so this resulted in stabilised juice colour during storage; however, the effect was found when the juice was stored at 5?C only.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anthocyanin</field><field name="subject">ellagic acid</field><field name="subject">colour degradation</field><field name="subject">phenolic acid</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Smoking care provision in hospitals: a study of prevalence and initiatives to increase care delivery</field><field name="creator">Freund, Megan</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">smoking cessation</field><field name="subject">hospital</field><field name="subject">clinical practice</field><field name="subject">patient care management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/35736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical effects of consolidation on solute transport in soil barriers.</field><field name="creator">Lewis, Timothy</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil barriers</field><field name="subject">clayey contaminant barriers</field><field name="subject">landfill liners</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/35743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal integration of GPS with inertial sensors: Modelling and implementation</field><field name="creator">Ding, Weidong, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Integration of GPS with Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) can provide reliable and complete positioning and geo-referencing parameters including position, velocity and attitude for dynamic platforms for a variety of applications. This research has been focusing on four modelling and implementation issues for a GPS/INS integrated platform in order to improve the overall integration performance, in particular: a) Time synchronization Having recognised that having a precise time synchronisation of measurements is fundamental in constructing a multi-sensor integration platform and is critical for achieving high data fusion performance, various time synchronisation scenarios and solutions have been investigated. A criterion for evaluating synchronisation accuracy and error impacts has been derived; an innovative time synchronisation solution has been proposed; an applicable data logging system has been implemented with off-the-shelf components and tested. b) Noise suppression of INS raw measurements Low cost INS sensors, especially MEMS INS, would normally exhibit much larger measurement noise than conventional INS sensors. A novel method of using vehicle dynamic information for de-noising raw INS sensor measurements has been proposed in this research. Since the vehicle dynamic model has the characteristic of a low pass filter, passing the raw INS sensor measurements through it effectively reduces the high frequency noise component.   c) Adaptive Kalman filtering The present data fusion algorithms, which are mostly based on the Kalman filter, have the stringent requirement on precise a priori knowledge of the system model and noise properties. This research has investigated the utilization issues of online stochastic modelling algorithm, and then proposed a new adaptive process noise scaling algorithm which has shown remarkable capability in autonomously tuning the process noise covariance estimates to the optimal magnitude.  d) Integration of a low cost INS sensor with a standalone GPS receiver To improve the performance where a standalone GPS receiver integrated with a MEMS INS, additional velocity aiding and a new integration structure has been adopted in this research. Field test shows that velocity determination accuracy could reach the centimetre level, and the errors of MEMS INS have been limited to such a level that it can generate stable attitude and heading references under low dynamic conditions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Integration</field><field name="subject">GPS</field><field name="subject">INS</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cellular interaction in the cardiac pacemaker: a modelling study</field><field name="creator">Cloherty, Shaun Liam, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In mammalian hearts, initiation of the heartbeat occurs in a region of specialised pacemaker cells known as the sinoatrial node (SAN). The SAN is a highly complex spatially distributed structure which displays considerable cellular heterogeneity and is subject to complex electrotonic interactions with the surrounding atrial tissue.  In this study, biophysically detailed ionic models of central and peripheral SAN pacemaker cells are described. These models are able to accurately reproduce experimental recordings of the membrane potential from central and peripheral SAN tissue. These models are used to investigate frequency synchronisation of electrically coupled cardiac pacemaker cells. Based on simulation results presented, it is proposed that cellular heterogeneity in the SAN plays an important role in achieving rhythm coordination and possibly contributes to the efficient activation of the surrounding atrial myocardium. This represents an important, previously unexplored, mechanism underlying pacemaker synchronisation and cardiac activation in vivo.  A spatial-gradient model of action potential heterogeneity within the SAN is then formulated using a large-scale least squares optimisation technique. This model accurately reproduces the smooth spatial variation in action potential characteristics observed in the SAN.  One and two dimensional models of the intact SAN are then formulated and three proposed models of SAN heterogeneity are investigated: 1) the discrete-region model, in which the SAN consists of a compact central region surrounded by a region of transitional pacemaker cells, 2) the gradient model, in which cells of the SAN exhibit a smooth variation in properties from the centre to the periphery of the SAN, and 3) the mosaic model, in which SAN and atrial cells are scattered throughout the SAN region with the proportion of atrial cells increasing towards the periphery.  Simulation results suggest that the gradient model achieves frequency entrainment more easily than the other models of SAN heterogeneity. The gradient model also reproduces action potential waveshapes and a site of earliest activation consistent with experimental observations in the intact SAN. It is therefore proposed that the gradient model of SAN heterogeneity represents the most plausible model of SAN organisation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sinoatrial node</field><field name="subject">cardiac pacemaker</field><field name="subject">cellular heterogeneity</field><field name="subject">frequency entrainment</field><field name="subject">mathematical modelling</field><field name="subject">monodomain model</field><field name="subject">parameter optimisation</field><field name="subject">least-squares optimisation</field><field name="subject">data-clamp technique</field><field name="subject">finite-difference method</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Superficial scald in apples</field><field name="creator">Golding, John B.</field><field name="description">Comparative physiological and biochemical studies were conducted with apple varieties which were susceptible (Granny Smith and Lady Williams) and resistant (Crofton) to superficial scald, to understand the mechanisms of scald aetiology. This provided a basis for the development of alternatives to diphenylamine to control the disorder in cool stored apples. The research confirmed earlier research, which showed that the typical scald symptoms were the result of the deposition of brown pigments on the tonoplast in hypodermal and epidermal cells. It has been generally accepted that these pigments were formed by the action of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) following its release from chloroplasts, as a result of membrane damage caused by the oxidation products of alpha-farnesene. However, intact and functional chloroplasts were observed in severely scalded peel tissue. It was proposed that peroxidase (POD) might play a more important role in scald development. The concept that the concentration of alpha-farnesene or its products was related to the severity of scald was examined, and results indicated that differences in scald susceptability were related to the ability of apple tissue to cope with oxidative stress at low temperatures rather than the concentration of alpha-farnesene. If alpha-farnesene has a scald promoting role, it may be as a participant in a free radical chain reaction rather than an initiator. Studies were conducted on the phenolic compounds present in apple peel, which led to the proposal that phenolics might confer scald resistance by conserving other antioxidants and preventing peroxidation of membrane lipids. An holistic model of scald development was proposed, which indicated that scald results from a chilling stress since scald only occurs at temperatures below 4 degrees C and only in apples in which the capacity to protect membranes from oxidative stress is low. The model proposed that POD may have a more important role than PPO in scald development than previously thought.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">apple scald</field><field name="subject">apple storage</field><field name="subject">farnesene</field><field name="subject">peroxidase</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zinc requirements of rice at elevated CO2</field><field name="creator">Defiani, Made Ria</field><field name="description">The current atmospheric CO2 partial pressure of 36 Pa is expected to nearly double by the end of the 21st Century.Increases of this magnitude are likely to profoundly change the biochemistry, growth and morphology of plants, particularly C3 species.The research in this thesis focuses on the micronutrient Zinc (Zn), because this element is associated with a number of macromolecules which play key roles in plant growth and development, particularly on the shoot apex.The main objective of the work was to study the influence of elevated CO2 Zn nutrition of rice in the vegetative phase.A second objective was to investigate whether high CO2 reduced Zn concentrations in grain of cv.

The learning organisation was seen as the vision that would help organisations keep ahead of the ever-changing demands. The most influential model has been Senge&#8217;s (1990) five disciplines of the learning organisation encompassing personal mastery, mental models, shared vision, team learning and systems thinking, and most discussions of the learning organisation draw on his theorising to a greater or lesser extent. Central to the concept of the learning organisation is knowledge and the individual, in particular, how knowledge is stored and shared across the organisation. To make the distinction between the organisational level and the individual level more salient, I developed the Individual/Organisational Orthogonal Model (I/O Orthogonal Model), which separates individual learning from organisational learning. The model assumes a social constructivist perspective. The aim of the model was to explore a range of concepts examined by Senge and other theorists across different groups of stakeholders, while questioning the assumption of shared culture or shared vision. To develop a more sophisticated understanding of the individual learning dimension, the model identifies the need to draw on the literature from psychology and education on the nature of learning, especially those theories which take a social constructivist perspective. Theories about interest and motivation are also included because they attempt to explain why individuals vary in their engagement with learning. Phase one of the empirical research addressed the question from the perspective of staff and management within the organisation using the case-study approach. This thesis examined trust from the traditional types of trust (i.e. incremental, span of trust, low trust etc), then compared the new construct of a workable level of trust with other recent conceptualisations of trust that have been realised in situations where there is a need for individuals to build trust quickly. Most importantly, this research gives credence to the importance of the context of the industry in which it is being conducted. The findings illustrated that advancement through becoming a learning organisation and advancement through becoming leaner and meaner by way of downsizing appears to be incompatible. The I/O Orthogonal Model proved a valuable starting point in identifying key gaps in the literature reviewed and as it suggested, some of the personal and emotional aspects came out in the findings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">knowledge management</field><field name="subject">organizational learning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15298</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new development in domain decomposition techniques for analysis of plates with mixed edge supports</field><field name="creator">Su, G.

The domain decomposition method is one of the most effective of these techniques, providing accurate numerical solutions. This method is used to investigate the vibration and buckling of flat, isotropic, thin and elastic plates with mixed edge support conditions. Two practical approaches have been developed as an extension of the domain decomposition method, namely, the primary-secondary domain (PSD) approach and the line-domains (LD) approach. The PSD approach decomposes a plate into one primary domain and one/two secondary domain(s). The LD approach considers interconnecting boundaries as dominant domains whose basic functions take a higher edge restraint from the neighbouring edges. Convergence and comparison studies are carried out on a number of selected rectangular plate cases.

Studies of the changes of the physiochemical and physiological parameters associated with ripening confirmed that no single measurement is suitable for the assessment of harvest maturity in the Japanese type plum cultivars(Prunus salicina Lindl). Two distinct patterns of ripening behaviour were identified. The cool storage (0 degrees Centigrade) responses of fruit harvested at three stages of maturity were examined. Total soluble proteins were extracted and separated from fruit during maturation and ripening using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. At least three proteins were first detected in fruit at optimum commercial harvest maturity. Since Gulfruby, Beauty and Rubyred (Japanese type plum cultivars) accumulated similar concentrations of aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid(ACC), it was suggested that the suppressed-climacteric phenotype is the result of an impaired ability of the fruit to convert this compound to ethylene</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cold storage of fruit</field><field name="subject">fruit preservation</field><field name="subject">fruit quality</field><field name="subject">plum cultivars</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/32</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards an autopoietic perspective on knowledge and organisation</field><field name="creator">Kay, Robert</field><field name="description">In this thesis a number of disparate subjects and notions are drawn together in order to move toward a coherent perspective on the notion of an organisation and the way in which organisations may be seen to survive.

The assumptions are made that the notions of the learning organisation and knowledge management are subsets of organisational survival.

The overall aim of the thesis is to explore the question : How does intervention lead to certain types of effects through dynamics within the community? These processes have been something of a 'black box' so far. This research is based on fieldwork in adjoining forest user groups in the western hills of Nepal for nearly eight months starting from August 1994. The research examined the outcome of earlier interventions in these adjoining forest communities. An important finding of this study is that the nature of use rights is evolving and contestable rather than fixed. It is further argued that there may be inequitable outcomes in terms of cost and benefit sharing amongst households after forests are officially handed over. This is attributed to differing perceptions about the nature of equity. The poor do not necessarily get fair treatment despite provisions for equality of opportunity in Operational Plans. It is argued that inequitable outcomes do not, however, necessarily lead to non-compliance partly because the system, though inequitable, is based on at least a pseudo-democratic model rather than direct coercion. Intervention has a role. However, it is argued that effective intervention has to pay proper attention to attaining better use rights and better equity. The key to attaining better use rights is the need to appreciate the fact that use rights are contestable and dynamic by nature</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nepal forestry</field><field name="subject">government intervention</field><field name="subject">use rights</field><field name="subject">equality of opportunity</field><field name="subject">local groups</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular investigation of genetic diversity in ericoid mycorrhizal endophytes associated with Woollsia pungens (Cav.) F. Muell (Epacridaceae)</field><field name="creator">Liu, Guangwu</field><field name="description">Two hundred and forty three fungal isolates were obtained from roots of four Woollsia pungens (Cav.) F. Muell plants collected from a field site in New South Wales, Australia. 175 sterile isolates were slow growing and dark-coloured on 2 percentage malt agar and were selected for further analysis. Microsatellite-primed PCR using the primers (GACA)4 and (GTG)5 separated these isolates into 50 genets. Isolates representative of 43 genets (including 168 isolates in total) formed typical ericoid mycorrhizal structures when inoculated onto roots of Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait (Ericaceae), confirming their status as mycorrhizal endophytes. It was estimated that a minimum of 43 genetically-distinct mycorrhizal mycelial genets were present in the root systems of the sampled W. pungens population with 7 to 15 distinct endophytic genets identified in each host plant, indicating that considerable genetic diversity exists within the endophyte population. While most genets were represented by less than 8 isolates, 3 genets contained up to 41 isolates, suggesting that root system colonisation by some mycelia may be extensive. While most fungal genets were shown to be confined to individual plants, 2 genets (genets 32 and 33), however, were present within the root systems of 2 adjacent plants (plants C and D), suggesting that the two root systems were interconnected by the endophyte mycelia. The ITS region of 13 mycorrhizal endophytes and a non-mycorrhizal isolate selected from the endophyte population were sequenced and compared to the sequence of Hymenoscyphus ericae as well as sequences from the GenBank database. A phylogenetic tree was generated from the nucleotide sequence data. This analysis revealed that 6 putative taxa were present in the root systems of 4 host plants. No isolates were positively identified to genus or species level. Closest matches with fungal sequences in the database indicated that most isolates probably belonged to the order Leotiales. Cluster analysis on the basis of the ITS sequences indicated that H. ericae was not clustered together with any endophytes from W. pungens, suggesting that endophytes of W. pungens are not identical to the known ericoid mycorrhizal fungus H. ericae. H. ericae had a low degree of sequence similarity with isolates from W. pungens, with similarities ranging from 68.3-80.6%. Cluster analysis based on DNA sequences of the ITS region did not fully support the groupings inferred from microsatellite-based fingerprinting.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Woollsia pungens</field><field name="subject">endophytes</field><field name="subject">ericoid mycorrhizas</field><field name="subject">microsatellite primed PCR</field><field name="subject">DNA analysis</field><field name="subject">plant species</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritional requirements of pregnant and lactating pregnant and lactating fallow deer (Dama dama)</field><field name="creator">Flesch, Jason S.</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a number of experiments undertaken to assess the nutritional requirements of pregnant and lactating fallow does with the aim of enhancing production and Quality Assurance in the Australian Deer Industry.Areas of study include determination of metabolisable energy intake of farmed fallow deer does of two genotypes throughout pregnancy and lactation, metabolisable energy intake of fallow deer fawns from 12 to 20 weeks of age and the effects of restricted maternal nutrition on foetal and placental development at different stages of gestation.In conjunction with nutritional adequacy, a body condition scoring system based on ante-mortem and post-mortem descriptors was developed for fallow deer.

The response of C4 plants is particularly important for Australia because they dominate the tropical grasslands that occupy 75% of the continent and form the basis for the pasture industry.

Adult S. vagans was found to consume a range of alternative prey if the primary host was not available, but only one of the alternative hosts had the potential to support reproduction. Time partitioning behaviour and prey consumption rates were assessed, and how S. vagans located their prey was investigated. S. vagans exhibited many of the attributes of an effective biological control agent such as high reproductive level, location of prey at low levels, reproduction at low densities, and ability to feed on alternative hosts.

An Australian study of three disciplines</field><field name="creator">Kingsley, Danny Abigail</field><field name="description">This dissertation addresses a specific aspect of the broad area of communication systems used among researchers. This research has undertaken to establish a broader view of the communication practices of scholars to understand the motivations behind their publication choices. Open access offers a solution to issues with the scholarly publication system such as delays in publication and restricted visibility of research due to high subscription costs. The principle of open access is to enable maximum access to findings from publicly funded research to maximise social returns on public investments. Despite the apparent benefits of open access, the uptake has been limited. 
&#182;
This thesis research takes a holistic view of the researcher as a communicator to uncover the reasons why researchers are making the publishing decisions they are. In-depth interviews were conducted with 43 researchers in three disciplines at two institutions, the Australian National University and the University of New South Wales. The disciplines, Chemistry, Sociology and Computer Science, were known to have different publication practices, The questions asked about all aspects of researcher communication including researching, authoring, informal communication, article submission, refereeing, mentoring and data storage.
&#182;
The findings show that traditional arguments for open access are ineffective. The Reward function of scholarly publishing is central to managing academic careers and supports traditional publishing systems. While having work openly accessible increases an academic&#146;s exposure and possibly therefore their citation counts, unless alternative internet-based forms of metrics are adopted, the open access option will not directly appeal to researchers.
&#182;
Information-seeking behaviour demonstrates how disciplinary differences affect researcher&#146;s interaction with technology. The disciplines showed marked differences in almost all the areas explored, and the behavioural norms expressed in each discipline have direct bearing on the likelihood of members of that discipline embracing open access. The &#145;institutional/disciplinary divide&#146; means that researchers must publish in ways that run counter to their disciplinary norms in order to satisfy institutional and grant funding requirements. 
&#182;
Until governments, and particularly university administrations, recognise the need to consider the discipline and the need to consider the individual and respond to these needs, and until there is a realisation that different disciplines may require radically different approaches, there will not be a large-scale adoption by individual researchers of the current open access tools. Either institutional repositories need to adapt dramatically to offer work practice benefits or the broader academic population will only use institutional repositories under duress, which is not the situation envisaged by open access advocates. The alternative is for communities to develop their own subject-based repositories, a development that again is likely to be highly dependent on communication norms in different disciplines.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">open access</field><field name="subject">scholarly communication</field><field name="subject">institutional repositories</field><field name="subject">institutional repository</field><field name="subject">diffusion of innovations</field><field name="subject">disciplinary differences</field><field name="subject">information seeking</field><field name="subject">reward</field><field name="subject">scholarly publishing</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090713.173505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Online collaboration in the Victorian Regional Gallery Network</field><field name="creator">Harley, James John</field><field name="description">The research seeks to identify the opportunities online collaboration may deliver to the   Victorian Regional Gallery Network (VRGN). The research further seeks to identify the   Commonwealth and Victorian State Government policy context that contributes to realising   these opportunities and the type of eBusiness models that could be applied to the online   environment of the Victorian Regional Gallery Network.      The problem statement of the research argues that in order for the Victorian Regional Gallery   Network (VRGN) to remain sustainable in the long term, it must develop collaborations   within and external to the gallery sector to deliver value adding solutions for income   generation and to cultural product, while seeking new business opportunities offered by the   use of Information Technology and the Internet. The range of products offered by the   galleries and their geographical distribution encourages collaborations to be undertaken, and   in doing so, serves the customers of the VRGN who are increasingly becoming users of the   Internet and who are expecting content online. Failing to consider the changing factors that   online technologies present for conducting business and communicating common issues   across the sector as a whole, puts the VRGN at risk of becoming redundant to its consumers   (audience/customers), and a liability to its stakeholders.      The major research question is as follows:      How can the Victorian Regional Gallery Network (VRGN), as a provider in the   cultural and entertainment sector, deliver cultural product to its audiences   (customers) through the use and application of collaborative online networks and   their related e-business technologies?      The research seeks to address this question by investigating the 14 regional galleries that   comprise the Victorian Regional Gallery Network, by reviewing their operations and   relationships with their stakeholders, and by suggesting a variety of electronic business   models that may assist in engaging in collaborative online networks.      The scope of the research has three broad objectives:      1.	the analysis of the role, function and activity of the Victorian Government in supporting collaborative online networks   2.	the identification of an appropriate collaboration model that uses eBusiness and that can be applied to the VRGN   3.	the analysis of the typical operating environment of the VRGN and the minimum requirements that will enable the implementation of a collaborative online network      At the heart of the research therefore is an understanding of the factors that contribute to a   collaborative online network, so that the galleries and the VRGN can efficiently and   competitively conduct business and communicate common issues amongst its members.      The case study design was selected, as the researcher systematically gathered in-depth   information on a single entity, i.e., the VRGN. The methodology deployed in the research   needed to effectively gather and collect relevant information from a variety of sources within   the VRGN and hence two main approaches were utilised. The first was a questionnaire using   the Likert and Dichotomous scale to collect data regarding the operations of the gallery, and   the second included a series of interviews which were developed to address specific questions   to the key staff within the main target groups of the research.      The conclusions that can be drawn out of the combined research include:      i.	The use of internet technology by the VRGN does not appear to be limited by technical issues. This provides a technological foundation on which to develop possible I.T. and collaborative online solutions for the VRGN   ii.	The technology required to develop collaboration in the first instance is not a barrier to implementation as it is common technology   iii.	Knowledge of the characteristics of collaboration including understanding the dynamics of trust, communication, equality, strategic alliances, knowledge distribution, negotiations and incentives are essential if it is to effectively and productively occur in the gallery network. The findings of the research indicate that collaboration currently occurs in the galleries, but it is also hampered by a culture that can sometimes work against the sector as a whole. The creation of strategic alliances amongst the galleries has also been found to be successful, but the advantages of these alliances are yet to be realised or tested across the VRGN   iv.	A Collaborative Online Network model has been proposed which may enable the gallery sector to share information, encourage communication, coordinate training and professional development opportunities and develop sector-wide research and development projects. The development of the collaborative online network would also assist in addressing the core issue of the research question concerning the provision of cultural product to state audiences through an online environment, and providing incentives to reduce cost and share resources   v.	The eBusiness model that will assist the VRGN in remaining competitive and active could use the Online Sales model, and will have the opportunity to exploit vertical aggregation of the Victorian arts industry to develop a portal or 'vortal' where the VRGN and its products and services can be marketed on a singular basis to the internet audience. The Online Sales Model also assists in developing a revenue stream for the galleries which may assist in its long term sustainability</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Online</field><field name="subject">collaboration</field><field name="subject">Victorian regional gallery network</field><field name="subject">art</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090714.134529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">History and Collective Memory of the Italian Migrant Workers&#65533; Organisation FILEF in 1970s Melbourne</field><field name="creator">Battiston, Simone</field><field name="description">This doctoral dissertation seeks to investigate the reasons that lay behind the rise, success and
decline of the Italian-run migrant workers&#65533; organisation FILEF during the 1970s in
Melbourne by reviewing and discussing some significant historical events. It does so in light of the existing literature, archival data and a string of oral accounts gathered from former and current key FILEF members and collaborators. It is hereby offering a better understanding of an otherwise poorly researched area of the Italian-Australian left-wing grassroots organisations in post-war Australia. The thesis has been divided into two parts, including introduction and conclusion. Part One (Chapters 1-5) reviews the historical and political background (in both Italy and Australia) that favoured the establishment of FILEF in Australia, including Melbourne, in the early 1970s; Part Two (Chapters 6-9) presents an
analysis of the historical development and socio-political role of FILEF Melbourne between 1972 and 1980.
Chapter One reviews the theoretical context, the representation of the history of FILEF in
previous publications, primary and secondary sources, the research strategy and methodology. Chapters Two and Three anchor the history of FILEF Melbourne to their respective background in Italy and Australia. That is, Chapter Two examines the post-war Italian emigration and its politicising by the Italian Left; Chapter Three focuses on the postwar emigration of Italians to Australia and outlines a profile of the Italian-Australian community. Chapter Four maps the route of the Italian-Australian Left in the 1950s and 1960s, that is from Italia Libera to the Lega Italo-Australiana. Chapter Five reviews the circumstances that led the establishment of the PCI in Australia respectively.
Chapter Six examines the origins and grassroots activism of FILEF in Melbourne in the 1970s, especially by looking at three areas of activity: migrant press, migrant welfare and
migrant politics. Chapter Seven researches the vulnerability of FILEF to the pressures of
conservative quarters by recounting the &#65533;Italian communist move in&#65533; (1975) and the federal
funding cut (1976) episodes. Chapter Eight, thoroughly revisits the Salemi case (1977), while
Chapter Nine explores the effects of the case and Salemi&#65533;s deportation on FILEF towards the
end of the 1970s.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Italian Federation of Emigrant Workers and their Families (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Italians - Melbourne - Political activity</field><field name="subject">Immigrants - Melbourne - Political activity</field><field name="subject">Multiculturalism - Melbourne &#65533; History</field><field name="subject">Ethnic Community Organization - Melbourne &#65533; History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20070823.143852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PARENT PARTICIPATION IN CURRICULUM DECISION MAKING: A CASE STUDY</field><field name="creator">Beagley, David Edward</field><field name="description">This study is an historical study of parent participation in school level decision making, particularly in curriculum issues, in relation to the Victorian Government policies of Devolution through the 1980s.  It was conducted as a case study of one rural secondary school, examining how the role of parents in the school&#65533;s curriculum development and associated decision making structures may have changed during the decade from the early 1980s to the early 1990s.

Three conceptual models were established, which served as analytical frameworks for the field data: a Theory model of how school level participation could operate, a Policies model deriving from the expectations of the major Government policies of the time, and an Historical model based on research and analyses of practice in Australia and overseas.

The findings indicate that little effective parent participation developed or took place in the school over the period under study.  Major contributing factors identified are the lack of policy direction and official mechanisms, especially in implementation of change, the definition of appropriate participant roles, the culture of traditional authorities in education (teacher in the classroom, principal in school processes and bureaucracy in administration), and the local factors of community attitudes and demographic profile.

While the local factors are significant, it is concluded that the policies did not provide sufficient direction or mechanism to overcome the entrenched culture of traditional authorities in schooling.  Changes in practice were directed more by the influence of specific personalities in single situations than any development of general attitude or institutional structure.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Curriculum</field><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="subject">Parent participation</field><field name="subject">Parent school relationship</field><field name="subject">Policy implementation</field><field name="subject">Rural education</field><field name="subject">School administration</field><field name="subject">School councils</field><field name="subject">School community relationship</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20041216.160407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perfection, Progress and Evolution: A Study in the History of Ideas</field><field name="creator">Berclouw, Marja E.</field><field name="description">The study of perfection, progress and evolution is a central theme in the history of
ideas. This thesis explores this theme seen and understood as part of a discourse in
the new fields of anthropology, sociology and psychology in the nineteenth century.
A particular focus is on the stance taken by philosophers, scientists and writers in
the discussion of theories of human physical and mental evolution, as well as on
their views concerning the nature of social progress and historical change. The
wisdom and feasibility of improving the human species is discussed alongside an
analysis of new methods of investigating and measuring physical and mental
attributes of the human organism. The instruments used to assess the development
of mind, body and society are described, and are viewed as part of an increased
emphasis on the use of technology as an integral part of modern life, and as a means
toward the ordered gathering of information in social-scientific practice. An
international perspective is taken by observing the way in which ideas about the
physical and mental development of humankind was discussed in light and
consequence of English and European scientific exploration in the Southern
Hemisphere. Further, an evaluation is made of the manner of the spread of new
thought in the social sciences from the intellectual and cultural &#65533;centre&#65533; of England
and Europe to the Anglo-European community located at the &#65533;periphery&#65533; in
Australia in the late nineteenth century. In particular the educative role played by the
non-professional enthusiast as a pivotal conduit for the dissemination of these ideas
is highlighted and linked back to a significant tradition of amateur scholarship as a
central phenomenon in the study of the history of ideas.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Idea (Philosophy)</field><field name="subject">Progress</field><field name="subject">Modern Philosophy</field><field name="subject">history of psychology</field><field name="subject">art and literature</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20061113.110150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Men's involvement in childbirth: implications for paternal identity</field><field name="creator">Chandler, Neale Anthony</field><field name="description">This research analyses the first paternal experience of childbirth and its affects on how men experience themselves as fathers. The study adopts a moral and philosophical standpoint, to ensure that the experiences of other key stakeholders in the childbirth realm are considered. This recognises that childbirth is women&#65533;s business, and how, as a male researcher, I have the potential to impose my views from a position of social dominance. 

Qualitative data were collected from twenty four participants who described their experiences of childbirth, in five focus groups. Participants were men whose first experience of childbirth occurred from as recently as one month to five years ago. Twelve participants were then involved in individual interviews to discuss, in depth, their experiences of fathering. An interview was also conducted with a midwife to illuminate her experiences of men and childbirth. 

Using interpretive interactionism as the chosen method for data analysis, I have identified the first paternal experience of childbirth as an epiphany in its major form. Epiphanies of which there are four types; the major, the cumulative, the minor illuminative and the relived, are those experiences that have the potential to transform and even radically alter peoples lives, and how they define themselves and their relations with others (Denzin,1989b:15). Data were phenomenologically analysed and six primary childbirth and fathering themes have been identified. 

Men&#65533;s first experience of childbirth entails emotions that range from fear and anger to awe and amazement. The reason that this life experience constitutes an epiphany for men, is that it affects how they experience themselves as fathers. The memory of their partner&#65533;s labour and birth pain is significant in how men construct their paternal identity.  Important to men is the ability to biologically sire a child, and in particular a son, the need to create the child in men&#65533;s own likeness and responsibility for financial provision and discipline of the child.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">childbirth</field><field name="subject">male birth support</field><field name="subject">men</field><field name="subject">fatherhood</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">sociology</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20050527.145459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Narcissism and self-enhancement: Self-presentation, affect, and the moderating role of contingencies of self-worth.</field><field name="creator">Collins, David Russell</field><field name="description">Narcissists typically present themselves in self-enhancing ways to gain validation (through positive social appraisals) of grandiose, yet uncertain self-views. Using e-mail, Studies 1 and 2 investigated several intra- and interpersonal variables that may influence narcissists&#65533; self-presentational behaviour. University students rated themselves on self domains requiring either external validation (e.g., attractiveness) or internal validation (e.g., morality), after being randomly assigned to be either accountable or non-accountable to an evaluative audience for their self-ratings (Study 1), to present their self-ratings to either a single or multiple person evaluative audience (Study 2), and to expect to present their self-ratings to either a high or low status evaluative audience (Studies 1 and 2). Results suggested that when degree of external self-worth contingency (Crocker &amp; Wolfe, 2001) was high, narcissists were insensitive to strategic self-presentational requirements, presenting themselves in a typically self-enhancing manner on external domains when accountable and when presenting to a multiple person audience. Non-narcissists showed more contextual sensitivity when degree of external self-worth contingency was high, and were more modest when these social contextual variables were present. Participants in Study 3 were given bogus positive or negative personality feedback on either their moral virtue or competitive spirit. Narcissists reported greater anger after receiving negative feedback, while also responding to negative feedback with inflated self-presentations. A key finding was that the combination of a high degree of self-worth contingency and negative feedback resulted in increases in self-reported depression and drops in state self-esteem in narcissists. Results suggest that narcissists are chronically vigilant for self-enhancement opportunities, but may be insensitive to social constraints and norms in their efforts to construct their grandiose identities. Narcissists are especially vigilant for self-enhancement opportunities on contingent domains, yet when negative feedback is received in these domains where self-worth is staked, depression and lowered self-esteem may result.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narcissism</field><field name="subject">Personality</field><field name="subject">Emotion</field><field name="subject">Strategic Self-Presentation</field><field name="subject">Identity Formation</field><field name="subject">Identity Goals</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20070503.165614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MEASURING ACTIVITY LIMITATION IN LOW BACK PAIN: A COMPARISON OF FIVE QUESTIONNAIRES</field><field name="creator">Davidson, Megan</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to evaluate the methods currently available to measure the functional outcomes of physiotherapy treatment for low back problems. As a preliminary step, all extant questionnaires were located and evaluated against practical criteria to determine their likely utility in clinical practice. This process identified a large number of questionnaires, however, only six back-specific questionnaires fulfilled the practical criteria for clinical application. Four of these questionnaires were selected for further evaluation along with a generic health status assessment instrument, the SF-36 Health Survey. Current recommendations suggest that a low-back specific and a generic questionnaire are required for comprehensive assessment of the impact of low back problems. The four back-specific questionnaires selected were the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, the Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale, the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire and the Waddell Disability Index. An evaluation of the literature on the clinimetric properties of these questionnaires revealed that little information was available for the Quebec and Waddell questionnaires and no information was available for any of the questionnaires for a clinical population of people with low back pain seeking physiotherapy treatment in an Australian setting. The primary aim of the research was identify which, if any, of the questionnaires should be recommended for measuring outcomes of physiotherapy treatment for low back pain. Consecutive ambulatory (non-admitted) patients presenting for physiotherapy treatment at three public hospital physiotherapy outpatient departments, three community health services, and four private practices were invited to enter the study. Patients were included if they were seeking treatment for a low back problem, were aged 18 or over, and could read and write English. Subjects completed the questionnaires on two occasions six-weeks apart. One hundred and forty subjects returned the first set of questionnaires, and 106 the second set. The mean age of the sample at pre-test was 51 (SD 17) and ranged from 18 to 89 years. Sixty-six percent were female, 41% were employed and 12% were receiving compensation for their back problem. Duration of the back complaint was more than six weeks for 56% of subjects, and 60% reported five or more previous episodes or continuous pain. Referred pain in the buttock thigh or leg was reported by 70% of subjects. The first aim was to compare the questionnaires for acceptability and comprehensibility. Data quality was high for all the questionnaires (less than 5% missing data). As expected, subjects found the more complex SF-36 Health Survey more difficult to complete than three of the low-back questionnaires. However, less than 10% of subjects found any of the questionnaires more than a little difficult to complete. The next aim was to explore the internal structure and inter-relationships of the low-back questionnaires and the three physical scales of the SF-36 Health Survey (Physical Functioning, Role-Physical and Bodily Pain). Analysis of item-item correlation, item-total correlation and Cronbach&#65533;s alpha confirmed that all scales were internally consistent. Factor analysis confirmed item homogeneity (unidimensionality) of all questionnaires except the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. The questionnaires were significantly intercorrelated, but correlations exceeded .70 only for the Oswestry, Quebec and Waddell questionnaires. The next aim of the research was to compare test-retest reliability of the questionnaires. The Oswestry, Quebec and SF-36 Physical Functioning scale had sufficient reliability and scale width for clinical application. Despite previous reports of high reliability, the Roland-Morris scale was significantly less reliable than several of the other questionnaires. This indicates the importance of establishing the measurement properties of a test in the population or setting in which it will be used. The Waddell Disability Index, and the SF-36 Role-Physical and Bodily Pain scales had insufficient scale width to be useful in clinical practice. More than 15% of respondents had an initial score on these scales that would not allow change to be detected with 90% confidence. The next aim of the research was to compare the responsiveness of the questionnaires. None of the questionnaires was consistently identified as more or less responsive than the others although two methods (effect size and Liang&#65533;s standardized response mean) suggested the SF-36 Bodily Pain scale was more responsive than some other questionnaires. A secondary aim of this section was to evaluate the validity of the many available responsiveness indices and a novel &#65533;reliable change&#65533; method. A &#65533;known groups&#65533; strategy was used to determine whether the responsiveness index could discriminate between the low-back relevant questionnaires and the SF-36 General Health scale, the scores of which did not change across the retest period. With the exception of the novel &#65533;reliable change&#65533; method the responsiveness indices were all found to be valid indicators of responsiveness. Guyatt&#65533;s Responsiveness Index, effect size and Liang&#65533;s standardized response mean discriminated at 95% confidence between the reference scale and all the low-back questionnaires. The standardized response mean, t-test, correlation and ROC methods discriminated between the reference scale and five or six of the seven other questionnaires. Guyatt&#65533;s index was recommended as the best of the criterion-based methods, and the effect size the best of the distribution-based methods. The three questionnaires identified as having sufficient reliability and scale width, the Oswestry, Quebec and SF-36 Physical Functioning scale, were next analysed for data fit to a Rasch model. All three questionnaires had good data fit and item function was not affected by time, age, gender or whether or not subjects reported avoiding bending. The final aim of this research was to identify by Rasch analysis items to supplement the SF-36 Physical Functioning scale. The new scale, named the Low-Back SF-36 Physical Functioning18, showed comparable reliability and responsiveness to the SF-36 Physical Functioning scale. Further research is required to establish the measurement properties of the Low-Back SF-36 Physical Functioning18 scale in an independent sample. However, it has the potential to improve the clinical measurement of function by providing clinicians with a single measurement tool for comprehensive assessment of patients with low back pain.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">low back pain</field><field name="subject">questionnaires</field><field name="subject">health measurement</field><field name="subject">psychometric properties</field><field name="subject">Rasch analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20051220.175347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond Choice : Family and Kinship in the Australian lesbian and gay &#65533;baby boom&#65533;</field><field name="creator">Dempsey, Deborah</field><field name="description">Planned parenthood within the lesbian and gay communities attracts considerable attention internationally among researchers, the media, and law and policy-makers. This Australian study situates the phenomenon&#65533;also known as the &#65533;gayby boom&#65533;&#65533;within the contemporary Australian socio-legal setting and the more international historical and political contexts of Gay and Women&#65533;s Liberation. It investigates how beliefs about nature, kinship, the sexed and reproductive body and political ideologies of family intersect in lesbians and gay men&#65533;s decision-making and stories of living their lives as parents. Two fields of intellectual enquiry are generative: the interest in families of choice and family practices within sociology and the post-modern anthropological critique of Western kinship in the era of assisted reproduction.
This is a qualitative study informed by a critical humanist approach. It is based on in-depth and key informant interviews conducted with 20 lesbians and 15 gay men (parents, &#65533;donor/dads&#65533; and prospective parents) as well as 7 people engaged in legal, health or therapeutic support to prospective and current parents. Also incorporated into the analysis are a range of other primary sources, including a substantial media debate, submissions to an assisted reproduction law reform process and primary documents supplied by participants such as parenting agreements and letters.
The study argues for the need to look beyond unitary concepts such as families of choice when theorising lesbian and gay parenthood. It is important to consider the historical, political and biographical conditions that make some notions of relatedness and decisions about having children seem more feasible, and indeed, natural than others. It explores how various notions of biological relatedness remain important in the formation of parent/child relationships, and the extent to which lesbians and gay men rely on strategic appeals to choice and biology in enacting families. Continuing constraints on who is eligible for clinically assisted reproductive technology in Australia lead to imaginative and harmonious, yet also fraught reproductive relationships.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lesbian mothers</field><field name="subject">Lesbian couples</field><field name="subject">Family relationships</field><field name="subject">Children of gay parents</field><field name="subject">Gay parents</field><field name="subject">Gay fathers</field><field name="subject">kinship</field><field name="subject">donor insemination</field><field name="subject">surrogacy</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20080530.164203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practised Ways of Being: Theorising Lesbians, Agency and Health</field><field name="creator">Dyson, Sue</field><field name="description">The contemporary field &#65533;lesbian health&#65533; was shaped by a range of social and political changes in the last third of the twentieth century, as well as by discourses originating in the historical regulation of lesbianism. In discourse, lesbians have been produced as invisible, passive victims of heterosexist and potentially homophobic health-care providers. This project sought to understand how lesbians produce and manage their own health, and their interactions with doctors and other health-care providers. The research questions asked how discourses about lesbianism and the construction of the lesbian health field influence the ways in which lesbians construct and manage their own health, and how lesbians position themselves as they negotiate clinical spaces. Using semi-structured interviews, 19 women, aged between 22 and 64 years, who identified as lesbian, gay, same-sex-attracted and queer were interviewed. Interview data were analysed using discourse and content analysis.
When they engaged with the health-care system, some participants produced their lesbianism as a social matter of no relevance to health; while for others their lesbianism was central to their health. An analysis of power relations revealed the complexity of ways the participants used agency to speak or remain silent about their sexual orientation. This was motivated by complex embodied understandings about the potential for emotional, physical or ontological harm involved in coming out in clinical spaces. Some chose to remain silent all, or some of the time, others to assertively identify themselves as lesbian. This depended on a range of contemporaneous factors including safety concerns, past experience and personal judgement. Whether to come out or not in the medical encounter was not necessarily a conscious decision, but was shaped by the individual&#65533;s embodied &#65533;sense for the game&#65533;. While the health-care system had frequently provided less than optimum care, these women were not passive, but used agency to decide whether or not their sexual orientation was relevant to the medical encounter.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lesbian health</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">coming out</field><field name="subject">sexual orientation</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20080630.162510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Blueprint for the Evaluation of an Ombudsman&#65533;s Office: A Case Study of the ICANN Office of the Ombudsman</field><field name="creator">Fowlie, Frank</field><field name="description">The title of this dissertation incorporates two key terms that define the work. First, the reader should view the paper by as a blueprint for evaluation which, like all generic blueprints, can be amended to fit the terrain, augmented based on new information or technology, or reduced to fit a stricter budget. It is also very much a blueprint that is developed from an action-oriented case study of an ombudsman, and is, therefore, relevant and tested.
A long-standing question in the ombudsman community has been how to evaluate ombudsman operations without impugning the determining characteristics of an ombudsman: independence, impartiality, and confidentiality.
There has been a lack of information or guidance, especially at the practitioner level, on how ombudsmen can develop meaningful evaluations without violating confidences or independence. This dissertation provides practitioners with tools that will enable them to conduct evaluations to determine information about ombudsman operations, formulation, and improvements.
The dissertation also provides information on two areas of interest for ombudsmen. First, it focuses on the design, development, reporting on, and assessment of a multipronged evaluation approach for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) Office of the Ombudsman. This review also considers the somewhat scarce existing literature in the field.
Second, this dissertation fills the gap in the existing literature by developing a practitioner&#65533;s guide to evaluation techniques. The evaluation research is developed and conducted with the ICANN Ombudsman by designing, implementing, and assessing a number of evaluation techniques: selfevaluation, client surveys, benchmarking activities, and the like.
The ICANN Office of the Ombudsman is a unique entity. It conducts online dispute resolution as an ombudsman. It is likely the first, if not the only online ombudsman operation anywhere. The ICANN Ombudsman has jurisdiction over complaints concerning the actions, decisions, or inactions of the ICANN Board of Directors, staff, or supporting organizations. It conducts its work using a wide variety of alternative dispute resolution techniques: negotiation, mediation, shuttle diplomacy, good offices, fact finding, investigation, and reporting and recommendation.
All this research is important, not simply to fill gaps in the literature, but to provide the growing ombudsman community with cost-effective tools that enable them to determine any gaps in community service, jurisdiction, or activity; to determine whether there are adequate resources; and to justify retention of either the incumbent or the programme generally. This is a set of skills and action plans that are in high demand by the community, and this dissertation provides the first major steps to meet that demand.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ombudsman</field><field name="subject">Evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20090402.093151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Participation in Government Disability Advisory Bodies in Australia: An Intellectual Disability perspective.</field><field name="creator">Frawley, Patsie</field><field name="description">This qualitative study examined the participatory experiences of people with an intellectual disability as members of government disability advisory bodies in Australia. These forums are one of the strategies adopted by governments to enable people with an intellectual disability to participate in the formulation of social policy. Such opportunities have arisen from progressive policy that frames people with an intellectual disability as full citizens with equal rights to inclusion and participation in society. 
Little research has considered how people with an intellectual disability experience the participatory opportunities that have grown from this recognition of their rights. This reflects the more traditional focus on their status and participation as consumers and service users. The central question of this study is how people with an intellectual disability experience participation in government advisory bodies, and how such forums can be inclusive and meaningful. 
This study positions people with an intellectual disability as the experts about their own experiences by relying primarily on their first person accounts of their experiences. Ethnographic and case study methods were employed including in-depth interviews with the central participants, document analysis, observation of the work of the advisory bodies and interviews with others involved in advisory bodies. Analysis led to the development of a typology of participation that describes the political and personal orientations people have to participation. 
The study found that structures and the processes used by advisory bodies can mediate people&#65533;s experiences; however more significantly, the experiences of people with intellectual disability are shaped by their perception of how they are regarded by others. Central to this is the efficacy of support based on the development of collegiate relationships, similar to the notion of civic friendship described by Reinders (2002), rather than support that is solely focussed on tangible accommodations 
The study concludes that citizen participation bodies have not fully recognised the personal and political potential of members with an intellectual disability. It presents evidence that people with an intellectual disability are capable of this form of participation, can provide legitimate and informed perspectives on policy and can engage meaningfully, given full recognition of their capacity to participate as well as structures and processes that enable this.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Policy participation</field><field name="subject">Participation support</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20090122.114029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Conceptual and Empirical Utility of Social Capital for Public Health</field><field name="creator">Gleeson, Deborah Helen</field><field name="description">This thesis evaluates the utility of &#65533;social capital&#65533; for public health in four dimensions (communication, explanation, practice and measurement) and at two levels (macro and micro), using interviews with public health workers and a theoretical analysis of social capital. It concludes that the concept is potentially useful for public health but that there are limitations to its utility, arising from the presence of two competing discourses or world views identified in the social capital literature: the rational choice discourse and the political economy discourse.

This thesis argues that although social capital is widely perceived to have rhetorical leverage in macro-level policy debates, its contested meaning draws into question the value of any consensus built on the glossing over of different world views. The concept has no value for communication at the micro level.

The rational choice theory of social capital appears useful for explaining the social determinants of health although it does not adequately account for the power structures which shape and constrain access to social capital, and it undervalues many aspects of social relationships. The political economy approach is more useful in these respects but is far more complex and difficult to quantify. It is unclear whether either of these theories adds much value to the existing literature which social capital tends to eclipse.

The concept has limited value for public health practice, as the dual world views embedded in it can be used to support widely varying policy directions. It is also limited by its inability to describe the dynamics of change or to identify levers for initiating change.

The meaningfulness of social capital indicators is compromised by the reductionism of the rational choice paradigm. The political economy discourse renders the development of quantitative indicators far more problematic but may be useful for informing qualitative research.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social capital</field><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">social determinants of health</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20050509.131918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between children's reading comprehension, word reading, language skills and memory in a normal sample</field><field name="creator">Goff, Deborah</field><field name="description">The current study aimed to develop a model of reading comprehension for children in middle primary school. As part of this overall aim there was a particular focus on the contribution of different types of memory to reading comprehension. The variables selected for consideration were identified from the child and adult literature and were of three types: word reading, language, and memory. The sample comprised 180 primary school children in grades 3-5 recruited from two primary schools. Their ages ranged from 8 years 7 months to 11 years 11 months. The reading comprehension measure was in a multiple-choice format with the text available when answering the questions. The five word reading measures were phonological recoding, orthographic processing, text reading accuracy, text reading speed, and a measure of exposure to print and reading experience. It is recognised that, although exposure to print is closely associated with word reading skills, it is not a direct measure of word reading. The language measures were oral comprehension, receptive vocabulary and receptive grammatical skills. The memory measures included measures of verbal and visuospatial short-term memory, measures of verbal and visuospatial working memory, a measure of the ability to inhibit irrelevant information from working memory and a measure of longer term verbal learning and retrieval. Correlational and hierachical multiple regression analyses were used to extrapolate the relationships between and among these variables.

The results revealed that, after controlling for age and general intellectual ability, the word reading and the language variables had a much stronger relationship with reading comprehension than the memory variables. The strongest independent predictors of reading comprehension were orthographic processing and oral comprehension. An additive combination of these two variables provided a more parsimonious model of reading comprehension than other models under consideration. It was concluded that for the age range in this study, language and word reading skills are the main predictors of reading comprehension and that the different types of memory do not make major contributions to reading comprehension.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reading comprehension</field><field name="subject">Oral comprehension</field><field name="subject">Simple View</field><field name="subject">Models of Reading Comprehension</field><field name="subject">Working Memory</field><field name="subject">Memory</field><field name="subject">Vocabulary</field><field name="subject">Language acquisition</field><field name="subject">School children</field><field name="subject">Word recognition</field><field name="subject">Reading (Primary)</field><field name="subject">Orthographic processing</field><field name="subject">Phonological recoding</field><field name="subject">Exposure to Print</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20060626.103641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing Casemix classification for acute hospital inpatients in Chengdu, China</field><field name="creator">Gong, Zhiping</field><field name="description">Hospital information systems in China are improving and a casemix system for describing inpatient care is looking more feasible than previously.  Implementing a casemix classification system for acute inpatient care in China could help to improve regional planning and hospital quality and efficiency. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Australian DRG system as the basis for developing an acute inpatient casemix system appropriate for China.  The applicability of the Australian AR-DRG system has been evaluated (in terms of homogeneity achieved and comparability of rank order) using inpatient data from Chengdu in Sichuan. 
Homogeneity achieved was good.  The R2 value (the coefficient of multiple determination) was 0.12 for LOS and 0.17 for cost using untrimmed data and using (L3H3) trimmed data, R2 was 0.45 for LOS and 0.59 for cost.  This explanatory power is comparable to other DRG classification systems although there are a few MDCs in which AR-DRGs exhibit poorer explanatory power. 
Rank order of groups was generally comparable.  The AR-DRG system incorporates hierarchies of DRGs within groups of adjacent DRGs, within medical and surgical partitions and across all DRGs within each MDC. I have compared the ranking of DRGs based on average cost with the ranking assumed by the AR-DRG system, at the adjacent group level, within partitions and at the level of the MDC. I used the Spearman Rank Correlation coefficient to compare DRG order across partitions and whole MDCs. In general the cost relativities of the Chinese inpatient episodes grouped by the AR-DRG system correspond to the logical hierarchies assumed by the system. On this basis Chinese and Australian episodes of care within most of the MDCs appear to reflect the same broad pattern of resource consumption.  
Further research will be needed to determine where and how the grouping rules used in the AR-DRG system might need to be changed to more accurately reflect Chinese circumstances.  For example the cost structures of Chinese health services are different from those in Australia.  The Australian Refined DRGs (AR-DRGs) would provide a sound basis from which to develop a Chinese version of DRGs.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Patient classification</field><field name="subject">Casemix</field><field name="subject">DRGs</field><field name="subject">Trimming</field><field name="subject">Homogeneity</field><field name="subject">Hierarchy</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20050314.195349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community, Attachment, Structures And The Epidemic.

Social identity theory has been employed to investigate the social-psychological aspects of gay identity at personal, social and community levels. The study compares three generations of gay men in Melbourne; pre- peri- and post-AIDS. As a starting point, the study employed focus groups to explore basic conceptions of gay community. In the first of two major data collection phases, 32 gay men between the ages of 18 and 40 participated in semistructured interviews of between 45 minutes and one and a half hours. The interviews explored the men&#65533;s social networks, past and present relationship to the commercial gay scene, feelings about gay organisations businesses, neighbourhoods, entertainment, aesthetics, the way they see other gay people, their thoughts about the impact of AIDS on gay communities and their aspirations for gay communities. The second phase of data collection utilised a questionnaire developed from the analysis of the interviews. The 55 item questionnaire covered demographic information, coming out history, initial experiences of the gay world, friendship networks, feelings about the institutions, people and conceptual elements of gay community, items concerning practices of gay community, the community attachment subscale from the SAPA study and items on HIV/AIDS. The questionnaire was completed by 432 gay men, 207 recruited at the Midsumma carnival, an annual gay and lesbian event in Melbourne and 225 through the mailing list of the Victorian AIDS Council. Analysis of the questionnaire data uncovered a complex constellation of difference in the conceptualisation and experience of gay community between the groups, particularly with regard to the content and boundaries of the category &#65533;gay community&#65533;.

in the Australian Alps</field><field name="creator">Grover, Samantha Patricia Power</field><field name="description">This research investigated carbon dynamics, water dynamics and peat formation at
Wellington Plain peatland in the Victorian Alps. The properties of bog peat and dried
peat were measured, and the ensuing results are outlined below.
The carbon chemistries of both bog peat and dried peat displayed changes with
depth consistent with an increase in the extent of decomposition of the organic
material. Representative changes in the alkyl:O-alkyl ratio down the profile were
0.14 to 0.96 for bog peat and 0.28 to 1.07 for dried peat. Laboratory incubations on
the influence of chemistry, particle size, water content and sample preparation
indicated that, in the absence of confounding factors, peat chemistry was the most
important factor in determining the size of the mineralisable carbon pool. Water
content was the most important factor in determining the rate of carbon
mineralization. In the field, both bog peat and dried peat emitted an average of
2 g CO2/m2/d from the surface. Carbon mineralisation was related to both soil
temperature and soil water content, and this relationship was used to model peat
mineralisation under a range of possible future climate scenarios. Below the surface,
however, I measured lower rates of decomposition in the dried peat than in the bog
peat.
The water-holding capacity of peat was measured in the laboratory, as was the
rate of water movement through peat. Specific yield decreased down the profile in
both bog peat (0.88 to 0.45 cm3/cm3) and dried peat (0.36 to 0.11 cm3/cm3). Hydraulic
conductivity also decreased down the profile in both peats: 5.1x10-4 to 3.0x10-6 m/s in
bog peat, and 1.0x10-4 to 7.0x10-6 m/s in dried peat. Relationships between the
hydrologic properties of peat and its physical and chemical properties were identified.
In the field, fluctuations in the watertable were monitored in concert with rainfall.
These laboratory and field measurements enabled me to develop models of the
hydrology of bog peat and dried peat.
Radioisotope dating indicated that both bog peat and dried peat began forming
around 3300 years ago. The bog peat appeared to have drained to form dried peat
between 131 and 139 years ago. Since that time, erosion appeared to have contributed
more to the loss of organic material from dried peat than carbon mineralisation had.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Peat</field><field name="subject">Australian Alps</field><field name="subject">Soils</field><field name="subject">Carbon chemistry</field><field name="subject">carbon mineralisation</field><field name="subject">decomposition</field><field name="subject">Hydrology</field><field name="subject">Hydraulic conductivity</field><field name="subject">water retention</field><field name="subject">lead dating</field><field name="subject">carbon dating</field><field name="subject">Peatland ecology</field><field name="subject">environmental history</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20070627.172842</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental health and primary health care: towards a new workforce model</field><field name="creator">Hanna, Elizabeth Gayle (Liz)</field><field name="description">Public health was once synonymous with environmental health. However, as living conditions improved the two fields diverged. Environmental factors are again re-emerging as hazards human health. Increasing global reliance on agricultural and veterinary chemicals (AgVets) over recent decades has is now a serious public health concern.  Evidence of their toxicity has prompted international efforts to minimize, monitor and manage exposure risks. Direct involvement of the primary health care workforce is seen as critical to this process, yet little data exists on the health burden on Australian rural communities imposed by these chemicals. 

The study presented here attempts to explore the impact of these chemicals on two rural communities in Victoria, and ascertain the how the existing primary heath care system responds to AgVet exposure issues. Health determinants are complex, and inter-related, and the client &#65533;provider interface is not an entity acting in isolation from other frameworks. The provider-client service relationship has evolved against a background of legislation and provider training. Many external factors also impinge, such as the structure and focus of the health sector, and Australia&#65533;s systematic approach to environmental and chemical management. Examination of this underlying infrastructure in Australia provided the background against which the issue of exposure to agricultural and veterinary chemicals was explored. A brief summary of international developments in this area served to provide insight as to what interventions may be introduced to address the issue of chemical exposure.

A CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Interview) survey of 1050 households sought the perspectives from two Victorian agricultural communities to gather self-reported AgVet exposure patterns and health data, and whether respondents perceived their health problems were linked to exposure. Respondents were also asked to comment on the primary health care service experiences from local providers, and which services they preferred to seek for health advice. Perspectives were then sought from all primary health care providers servicing these communities.  Information was sought on their level of expertise in diagnosing, and managing exposure related illness, via face-to-face interviews, focus groups and paper surveys. 

The study revealed rural communities have a long history of hazardous exposure to toxic AgVets. Awareness of toxicity risks is growing, yet further scope exists to improve safe handling of chemicals. High levels of illnesses known be associated with AgVet exposure exist among rural populations. Many believe their own ill-health is linked to exposure, and express strong dissatisfaction with the apparent lack of environmental health expertise especially among their GPs. Health providers demonstrated limited understanding of the health impacts of AgVet exposure. 

The lack of environmental health expertise among the existing primary health care workforce means that health conditions associated with exposure to AgVets are not being identified, and the absence of health intelligence hampers health planning. In Australia, the health, environment and primary industries sectors function in effect, as distinct silos, with little cross-fertilisation. The United States has combined its agricultural chemical legislative authority to develop a focus on human health, establish direct links, and biomonitoring programs to protect human heath. The U.S. has also developed environmental health expertise at the primary health care level to address community needs as they arise. Strategies are required in Australia to connect the environment, chemical management and health portfolios, with respect to the emerging environmental issues of chemical exposure. There is a need also in Australia to inject environmental health capacity into the primary health care practice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">primary health care</field><field name="subject">rural health</field><field name="subject">farmwork</field><field name="subject">environmental health</field><field name="subject">agricultural chemicals</field><field name="subject">pesticides</field><field name="subject">toxicity</field><field name="subject">health service management</field><field name="subject">chemical regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20061110.152550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BREAKING THE MIND-FORG&#65533;D MANACLES :
a study of adolescent transformation</field><field name="creator">Heywood, Peta</field><field name="description">This study has adopted the metaphor of &#65533;mind-forged manacles&#65533; to explore adolescent
transformation within an educational context. It does this by examining the experiences of
two groups of people who participated in an intensive, one-off personal development
program for adolescents, known as Discovery. The first study involves secondary school
students for whom the program was part of the school curriculum. The second study
consists of an older group of people who did the program during their adolescence and
outside the formal education system. The third study is a contemplation of transformation
derived from my experience as researcher during the course of completing this thesis.
In an attempt to reflect the perspectival worldview from within which the study is created I have drawn on a range of theorists. To integrate their ideas I created three different &#65533;lenses&#65533;
or ways of viewing the data. The first lens is developed from consciousness theory, the
second from process philosophy and complex self-organising systems theory, and the third
from individual humanistic psychology. The educational pedagogy is holistic and embraces
developmental models of thinking and learning. The study uses participant reflection to
argue that a program of intentionally focussed challenges, combined with the support that
enables these challenges to be successfully met, can be transformational for many young
people. It suggests that the complex postmodern world requires teachers to be aware of
their own and their students&#65533; consciousness, and demands learning experiences that are
deliberately focussed on helping the process of consciousness transformation rather than
only on achieving predetermined outcomes. Transformation is understood as a shift to a
different order of consciousness in which it is how one sees rather than what one sees that
changes. With each shift towards a new order of consciousness the mind-forged manacles are
loosed and individuals accept increasing responsibility for their lives and how they live them.
Educational programs can be developed to assist this process.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Change Psychology</field><field name="subject">Attitude change</field><field name="subject">Adolescent psychology</field><field name="subject">Adolescence</field><field name="subject">Teenagers</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Participant observation</field><field name="subject">Consciousness</field><field name="subject">Youth development</field><field name="subject">Transformation</field><field name="subject">Transformative learning</field><field name="subject">Experiential learning</field><field name="subject">Ways of knowing</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20081210.150230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE AND UNDERSTAND MOMENTS OF EXPERIENTIAL MEANING WITHIN THE DANCE THERAPY PROCESS FOR A PATIENT WITH DEMENTIA</field><field name="creator">Hill, Heather</field><field name="description">This minor thesis reports an attempt to describe and understand moments of experiential meaning within the dance therapy process for a patient with dementia.  It also documents an attempt to develop a methodology which could adequately grasp the complexities of such an experience.

A phenomenological approach with its emphasis on allowing the phenomenon to reveal itself through multiple perspectives seemed the most appropriate for this study.  However, while phenomenology influenced the format of the dance therapy sessions as well as the constitution and analysis of the data, ultimately a hermeneutic analysis was employed for further explication of the material.

The study consisted of four individual dance therapy sessions with an 85 year old patient with moderate dementia.  The researcher/therapist worked improvisationally and a music therapist provided improvised music.  After the sessions, all of which were videotaped, the patient was videotaped viewing the dance session video, in order to obtain her verbal or non-verbal responses to the material.

It was decided to focus on the 'significant moments', selected intuitively as moments which seemed high points of the session.  A naive description was made, on which an adaptation of Giorgi's four-phase method of analysis was applied.  Certain foci, such as energy flow, were identified and individually described.  In time, it became clear that the written descriptions alone were insufficient and that reflection would need to cover all the material from multiple sources and perspectives.  This was done, and the data were later further explicated by reference to writings on dance therapy, dance aesthetics and the philosophical concept of the embodied self, and Sacks's neurological writings on the awakened self.

The conclusions of the research were that the patient was not only transformed within the dance session and able to re-create aspects of her old self, but also underwent, through the experience as a whole (the dance and the reflection upon it, facilitated by the video viewing), a change in awareness, through which she reintegrated the past with the present and, in her words, 'came out of the cupboard...into the brightness'.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dance therapy</field><field name="subject">Dementia</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's</field><field name="subject">Self</field><field name="subject">Person centered care</field><field name="subject">Patients</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Movement therapy</field><field name="subject">Non-verbal communication</field><field name="subject">Older people</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20041215.095518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TALKING THE TALK BUT NOT WALKING THE WALK: BARRIERS TO PERSON CENTRED CARE IN DEMENTIA</field><field name="creator">Hill, Heather</field><field name="description">While the concept of person-centred care in dementia has been around for 15 years or more and has attracted much interest and enthusiasm, aged care facilities continue to have difficulty in actually implementing and maintaining person-centred practices. In this study I explore the experience of one aged care facility in order to identify the barriers to changing care practice. The research took place in an ethno-specific (Jewish) aged care facility, Star of David, which was in the process of setting up a program for its residents with dementia based on person-centred principles. The methodology used in the research study was ethnographic, involving participant observation and interview, with a particular focus on a limited number of participants: four residents and their families, four senior staff, four personal care attendants and the executive director. Interviews were also conducted with staff members from three other aged care facilities. The findings showed that Star of David was unable to bring about substantial change in its care practices, while the external interviews and the literature suggest that other facilities have similar difficulties. I identify three major types of barrier: procedural barriers within the institution itself; (government) policy; and barriers relating to hegemonic values and beliefs which underpin established health care practice. These three types of barrier interact with and reinforce one another. I conclude that if we are to change care practice in institutions, we must address all of these barriers at the same time. Finally, I suggest that person-centred care itself, which continues to place emphasis on professional service provision, may only be the beginning of necessary change. In order to be truly person-centred, we need to move towards a more community based or public health approach which recognizes the need of all persons to be treated both as significant individuals and accepted as part of a community.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dementia</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's</field><field name="subject">Person centered care</field><field name="subject">Older people</field><field name="subject">Hegemony</field><field name="subject">Aged care facility</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="subject">Jewish community</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20041215.100826</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TIED TO THE COSMOS BY THE HEARTSTRINGS : AN EXPLORATORY CASE STUDY OF ART THERAPY WITH AN INDIVIDUAL DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA</field><field name="creator">Hirschhorn, Yael</field><field name="description">The focus of this thesis is to investigate the use of art therapy in the treatment of an individual diagnosed with schizophrenia.

Trinidad and Tobago became one of the world's largest oil refinery and transhipment centres. In 1969 the British oil companies began to withdraw their investments and requested the nationalisation of their assets. 
  In 1985 the US companies withdrew their investments in response to the US government's deregulation of the domestic oil industry and financial incentives to bring their investments back home. Requested nationalisation led to the state-ownership of the oil sector.
  The government of Trinidad set up state-owned petrochemical and iron and steel industries, with some of the world's most sophisticated technology, to utilise the country's large natural gas reserves. But by 1988 state capitalism had failed to provide the expected economic and social benefits, despite the drain on limited financial reserves and massive foreign loans. The government's reliance on the oil sector as the `prime mover' of the economy had caused sectoral and trade imbalance, high inflation, increased unemployment, currency instability, debt crisis and political instability which culminated in an attempted coup in July 1990.
  The root cause of the failure of state capitalism was the governments' rush to industrialise and the structure of the state petroleum enterprises. The lack of accountability and responsibility of top management and government interference led to poorly run, unprofitable industries in which government waste and corruption were common.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">petrochemical industry</field><field name="subject">natural gas</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20080304.171849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technological Change And Scarcity Of Soil
In The Tea Sector Of Sri Lanka</field><field name="creator">Jayasuriya, Rohan Terrence</field><field name="description">This study analyses the technological change in the aggregate tea sector of Sri Lanka, by contributing to an understanding of total factor productivity change with assessment of the extent and nature of such changes from  1960/61 to  1994/95.  The total factor productivity measures are then used to define a conceptually sound measure of the production cost of land degradation, providing insight into the scarcity of soil in the tea sector.

Total factor productivity in the tea sector, increased at an estimated annual rate of  1.82 percent during the study period. This resulted from an estimated annual rate of increase of 0.01 percent in total output and a considerably larger rate of  1.81 percent annual decrease in total input. Thus, the reason for total factor productivity growth was largely due to cost savings associated with decreased use of inputs rather than increased output. Land and capital inputs showed significant negative growth trends, confirming a lack of long-term investment in the tea sector. As expected, all the partial factor productivities showed increases over the study period due to lower use of those individual inputs; the most significant changes occurring in the partial productivities of land and capital inputs. The terms of trade and the returns to costs ratio, exhibited an annual rate of decrease of around 3.7 percent and  1.9 percent, respectively. The producer terms of trade growth rate of  -3.7 percent, has been brought about by an estimated annual rate of increase in prices received of  10.6 percent compared with an increase of  14.3 percent in prices paid. 

The Sri Lankan tea industry, once pre-eminent in the world, has been going through intermittent crises for a long time due to problems related to low productivity and the high cost of production. The management of the nationalised plantations proved inadequate to meet the task of adjusting to the new challenges of raising productivity and remaining competitive. The contribution of the tea industry to the economy declined. Among other causes, stagnating crop productivity was found to be an important factor. Land degradation in the  form of soil  erosion,  was  found  to be a serious  problem  for the  entire  tea sector. 


Careless and ecologically unbalanced agricultural practices, have over the years, led to varying degrees of degradation of the tea soils. However, these physical measures of land degradation do not necessarily reveal an economic or social problem. 

In the second part of the study, an attempt is made to quantify the impact that land degradation has on tea production. Based on the theoretical relationship of the impact of technological progress and land degradation on tea production, a regression model was fitted to deconstruct the total factor productivity variable. The objective of this approach is to find an economic value for land degradation by quantifying the extent of this impact on aggregate tea production in Sri Lanka. One of the key points to come out of this estimation exercise, is the difficulty of isolating the impact of individual factors on measured total factor productivity. On the basis of available data and the chosen model, it could be concluded that the impact of technological progress has outweighed the negative effect of land degradation in the tea sector, over the study period. Considering the fact that investment in tea research is mainly on developing varieties of vegetatively propagated clonal tea, and the associated very long gestation periods involved, a much larger lag length of the order of 25-35 years is recommended for the research investment variable, to enable calculation of the marginal internal rate of return to public investment in tea. Importantly, a larger set of data will become available over the next decade or so which will enable appropriate lags to be incorporated in future research on productivity in the tea industry.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rural land use - Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">Tea trade - Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">Land degradation</field><field name="subject">soil scarcity</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20070420.122921</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The anthropology of a workplace: the Victorian Land Titles Office</field><field name="creator">Katz, Evie</field><field name="description">This thesis uses a cultural perspective to explore the working life of employees in a government office during the 1980s.

At La Trobe University, Australia: Academic And Related Challenges</field><field name="creator">Kole, John Kirwa Tum</field><field name="description">This study involves an exploration of the perceptions of four overseas Kenyan students about their educational experiences at La Trobe University. A related aim of this research is to find out how these four students&#65533; previous learning in Kenya affects their learning and living experiences in Australia, for instance, in terms of demands associated with differences in learning and teaching styles, cultural expectations and proficiencies in English.

A non-positivist, qualitative methodology is adopted for this research which employs an interview-based case study approach. Qualitative research demands that the world be approached with the assumption that nothing is trivial and that everything has the potential of being a clue which might unlock more comprehensive understanding of what is being researched. 

While the findings of this study confirm current understandings of the issues that international students commonly face, they also provide a more complex and individualized picture of the needs and aspirations of overseas Kenyan students. As the case studies demonstrate, the academic and related challenges four Kenyan students have encountered at La Trobe University are best understood in relation to several contexts. The difficulties these international students have experienced in the context of transition or border crossing &#65533; between two countries, cultures and educational systems &#65533; were exacerbated by inadequate pre-departure preparation and orientation on arrival. Incongruities between two educational systems &#65533; in particular between their prior teacher-centred schooling in Kenya and the unfamiliar student-centred university education in Australia &#65533; colour the academic and related challenges such students struggle to address, at least in their initial year at University. The broader, global context of the commodification and marketization of higher education &#65533; along with increasing strains of an under-resourced university sector in Australia &#65533; also impinge upon the lives of these four La Trobe students, in a variety of ways.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Overseas students</field><field name="subject">academic and related challenges</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20090130.115451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEYS:
MOTIVATIONS BEHIND FRONTIER TRAVEL EXPERIENCES AND IMPLICATIONS FOR TOURISM MARKETING</field><field name="creator">Laing, Jennifer H.</field><field name="description">Tourists are now visiting some of the most remote and amazing places on Earth, travelling to &#65533;frontiers&#65533; on journeys that are psychological and emotional as well as geographical or physical. These extraordinary journeys to the Poles, the peaks of the highest mountains in the world, harsh deserts and even outer space test both physical and mental endurance and can be characterised as &#65533;unique&#65533; even in the current era. Travelling largely without the aid of a commercial tour operator or guide, the frontier traveller usually invests a great deal of time and resources in their travel experience, often with the assistance of sponsorship, and generally takes part in an extensive and arduous preparation period in their quest for the extraordinary. While the search for new and unique tourism destinations and experiences appears to be relentless in this post-modern era, the frontier traveller appears to be searching for the &#65533;authentic&#65533; beyond the &#65533;tourist bubble,&#65533; both in relation to self and setting. These frontier &#65533;trailblazers&#65533; are already being followed by guided adventure tourists and some of the former are supplementing their incomes and funding their own travel by leading tours or guiding others to the frontier. Studying the extraordinary experiences of the frontier traveller could therefore provide us with a glimpse of the future of travel, although likely to occur in a more structured and less risky guise. Uncovering the motivations for this form of travel will also assist with future marketing of these experiences, including elements of the marketing mix such as product development and promotion.

This thesis examines the motivations behind frontier travel and considers the implications of the findings for tourism marketing. Unstructured, long interviews with 37 individuals were used to uncover the motivations behind these experiences, supplemented by content analysis of narratives produced by frontier travellers, encompassing 50 autobiographies, two online diaries and online interviews with two individuals. The interview participants were largely selected through purposive sampling, in that they were screened as fitting the criteria of a past or potential frontier traveller before being interviewed. They were predominantly born and living in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, and 29 of the 37 individuals were male. Ages of participants ranged from 24 to 60 years of age. Interviews continued until saturation of categories of motivation had been reached. Texts were mainly located through searches of bookshops and libraries, including the author&#65533;s personal library. A qualitative methodological approach was chosen in order to provide rich data and allow the researcher to enter the world of the frontier traveller. An interpretive paradigm based on a constructivist paradigm underpinned this study, with an ontological stance based on multiple realities and an epistemological position where participants and myself as the researcher created understandings. The methodology outlined above was consistent with this position and was designed to identify different constructions of the data and seek consensus, where possible. The literature on motivations provides a complex plethora of theories and models, many of which contradict each other, so a principal objective of this study was to work from first principles, grounding a theory of motivations pertaining to frontier travel experiences in the data, rather than seeking to test out a pre-existing model or theory.

Overall, the research findings show that motivations for frontier travel can be analysed under the broad heading of &#65533;adventure,&#65533; which is composed of a variety of sub-motives such as achievement and competence, challenge, thrill-seeking and sensation, ego, dreams or fantasies, self-actualisation, cognizance (exploration/discovery), freedom/escape motives (autonomy), isolation and solitude, spirituality, camaraderie and communitas, authenticity, prestige (external rewards), pro-social motives and a love of nature and wilderness. Risk or danger is an element of these experiences and feeds into many of the motivations identified in this study. A theory of motivations behind frontier travel experiences has been developed, covering intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, as well as achievement-motivated behaviour. Pre-travel influences and inspirations such as literature, cinema, visual stimuli, childhood games, heroes and mentors, family influences and educative influences are also considered with respect to their effect on motivational behaviour. An exploratory typology was then developed for frontier travellers, based on common motivations, which might be used to segment the market. Four basic types have been identified and labelled or categorised as &#65533;Seekers of Truth,&#65533; &#65533;Enlightened Explorers,&#65533; &#65533;Concerned Elitists,&#65533; and &#65533;Freedom Seekers.&#65533; Key motivations behind specific frontier travel experiences have also been identified.

Each frontier traveller will exhibit some, but not all, of the motivations highlighted in this study. Segmenting the market on the basis of motivations may therefore be a difficult, if not impossible task. However, marketers could use the information unearthed during this study in the marketing mix to develop new products aimed at satisfying some of the key motivations and use the findings as themes to be highlighted in promotional literature such as brochures and websites. This thesis also argues that the study of travel motivations in the future would be better served by considering motivations behind market niches such as frontier travel, rather than attempting to develop a comprehensive theory of motivations covering the whole travel industry.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Extreme tourism</field><field name="subject">extreme tourists</field><field name="subject">frontier travel</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">travel</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">adventure</field><field name="subject">extreme travel</field><field name="subject">niche travel</field><field name="subject">destination</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20070516.142914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relating Women : Lesbian Experience of Friendship</field><field name="creator">Lienert, Tania Marie</field><field name="description">Friends are of crucial importance to lesbians&#65533; lives, their significance heightened due to lack of acceptance from blood family, work colleagues and society. Despite a proliferation of literature on lesbians&#65533; love relationships, lesbians&#65533; friendships remain understudied. In the light of theorising about widespread shifts in intimacy patterns in modern industrial societies, this thesis examines the role of friendship for contemporary lesbians. It takes an interdisciplinary approach, using lesbian feminist, feminist psychological and mainstream sociological theories to interpret lesbians&#65533; negotiations of their friendships and preoccupations with their own continually developing sense of self. The study finds that firstly, the most significant issue in negotiating friendships is deciding on a lesbian identity despite socialisation to &#65533;compulsory heterosexuality&#65533;. Friends are expected to be accepting and supportive or they are lost. Discrimination, the fact that the lover is the &#65533;best friend&#65533;, struggles with difference in lesbian communities, time constraints and a more general shift to individualism mean that community and family contacts are replaced by small, supportive and affirming friendship networks. These meet needs and within them lesbians negotiate a sense of self, but for the most part with no template of political consciousness. Secondly, while friendships are important, they are also difficult. The fluidity of the friendship relationship, blurred boundaries between friends and lovers, and women&#65533;s moral &#65533;imperative to care&#65533; all provide barriers to communication. Thirdly, while lesbians value &#65533;the relational self&#65533;, a confident sense of self is challenged when close-connected relationships sit at odds both with mainstream, heterocentric culture, and with traditional models of psychology which promote independence and separateness. Lesbians who are confident communicators, who have access to alternative feminist discourses which value relatedness, and who, together with their friends, are open to change, are able to negotiate satisfactory friendships and relationships. The study demonstrates lesbians&#65533; complex subjectivities as changing selves are negotiated through friendships, love relationships and communities, particularly through experiences of loss.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">female friendship</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">social networks</field><field name="subject">interpersonal relations</field><field name="subject">lesbians</field><field name="subject">intimacy</field><field name="subject">lesbianism</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20041006.114625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiology of Chilling-Related Postharvest Rind Breakdown of Navel Oranges (Citrus Sinensis (L.) Osbeck)</field><field name="creator">Lindhout, Katina</field><field name="description">Chilling-related postharvest rind breakdown of navel oranges is a significant economic problem worldwide.
Chilling injury (CI) symptoms on navel orange fruit vary, and descriptive classification is generally ad hoc, making inter-study comparisons difficult.  In this study, external symptoms of CI were related to patterns of cellular collapse in affected flavedo tissue, and a classification system developed to aid consistent symptom identification and improve communication within the supply chain. 
Potential markers of senescence were evaluated because older fruit were found to be more susceptible to CI.  Electrolyte leakage, moisture content and protein content of flavedo tissue were ineffective indicators of both senescence and chilling stress.  Rind colour and internal maturity were generally good indicators of fruit age, but lacked sensitivity over short time periods to be of use.
Although there was a strong seasonal effect on CI incidence, pre-storage treatments, including hot water and methyl jasmonate, generally reduced the incidence of CI.  Because these treatments elicit defence responses that protect tissue from chilling stress, the response and efficiency of plant defence systems is probably an important factor in chilling tolerance.
The concentration of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) in flavedo tissue was lower in fruit that were stored at a chilling temperature (1&#65533;C) compared to fruit that were stored at a non-chilling temperature (12&#65533;C) and lipid peroxidation did not increase during storage at 1&#65533;C.  There was also a lower concentration of LOOH in the chilling sensitive variety than in the chilling tolerant variety.  Therefore, increased lipid peroxidation is not related to chilling stress and subsequent injury but the results do suggest a role for LOOH in stress signalling.  Antioxidant activity in the lipophilic fraction of flavedo tissue extracts increased as fruit senesced and was strongly correlated with carotenoid content.  LOOH concentrations in flavedo tissue also increased as fruit senesced.  The antioxidant activity of both the lipophilic and hydrophilic fractions of flavedo tissue extracts was higher in fruit stored at 12&#65533;C than in fruit stored at 1&#65533;C.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Citrus</field><field name="subject">cold storage</field><field name="subject">temperature stress</field><field name="subject">cross-tolerance</field><field name="subject">oxidation</field><field name="subject">oxidative stress.</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20080526.093527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Closing the gap between policy and reality: a study of community health services in Chengdu and Panzhihua</field><field name="creator">Liu, Chaojie (George)</field><field name="description">The development of community health services (CHS), characterised in particular by the emergence of general practitioners and the establishment of community health centres, is one of the top priorities on the policy agenda for urban health reform in China. The primary and secondary levels of hospitals are being urged to change functions, shifting from traditional hospital services to CHS.
This study aimed to contribute to the development of training strategies for CHS through documenting the policy, administrative and institutional arrangements of the CHS programs, identifying performance problems, and analysing relevant determinants that underpin the practice and performance of CHS. Document analysis, indepth interview and questionnaire survey were adopted as main methodological approaches. The study was undertaken in Chengdu and Panzhihua, which included observation of 14 community health centres, interview with 23 general practitioners and managers, and a random sample survey among 1041 residents.
This study revealed that the top priority of the CHS programs was to try to stay alive through competing with other health institutions for consumers who could afford medical charges and to provide clinical services that would generate good revenues. The accessibility to medical care for the community residents had not been improved significantly. Poor response to local population health issues, inefficient use of resources and poor quality of services were amongst the key performance problems. There was little prospect of the CHS institutions achieving sustainable development.
There was a widespread agreement among the CHS managers and practitioners that training is an essential strategy in improving the CHS performance. However, when policy, system, and cultural barriers are not properly addressed, training means little. There were evident organisational failings and lack of inter-governmental collaborations and leaderships in developing CHS. The lack of policy coherence with respect to organisational incentives impeded the achievement of the goals of CHS. There was also a lack of consumer participation and support.
These findings have implications for both policy development and training arrangements. The development of CHS needs to be considered as a system change rather than in terms of isolated institutional developments. Training arrangements for CHS need to offer competencies for a wide range of organisations and professionals to enable them to improve their daily works and also to contribute to solving some of the system problems. The training programs developed for governmental officials, hospital and CHS managers, general practitioners, community nurses, public health workers, pharmacists and other CHS practitioners need to be aligned with a unified goal and facilitate the development of the supportive environments and inter-organisational collaborations (partnerships).</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community health services</field><field name="subject">primary health care</field><field name="subject">health care reform</field><field name="subject">health policy</field><field name="subject">physicians</field><field name="subject">general practice</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Chengdu</field><field name="subject">Panzhihua</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20050303.102952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE RHETORIC OF RECONCILIATION:
EVIDENCE AND JUDICIAL SUBJECTIVITY IN CUBILLO v COMMONWEALTH</field><field name="creator">Luker, Trish</field><field name="description">In August 2000, Justice O&#65533;Loughlin of the Federal Court of Australia handed down the decision in Cubillo v Commonwealth in which Lorna Cubillo and Peter Gunner took action against the Commonwealth Government, arguing that it was vicariously liable for their removal from their families and communities as children and subsequent detentions in the Northern Territory during the 1940s and 1950s. The case is the landmark decision in relation to legal action taken by members of the Stolen Generations.
Using the decision in Cubillo as a key site of contestation, my thesis provides a critique of legal positivism as the dominant jurisprudential discourse operating within the Anglo-Australian legal system. I argue that the function of legal positivism as the principal paradigm and source of authority for the decision serves to ensure that the debate concerning reconciliation in Australia operates rhetorically to maintain whiteness at the centre of political and discursive power. Specifically concerned with the performative function of legal discourse, the thesis is an interrogation of the interface of law and language, of rhetoric, and the semiotics of legal discourse.
The dominant theory of evidence law is a rationalist and empiricist epistemology in which oral testimony and documentary evidence are regarded as mediating the relationship between proof and truth. I argue that by attributing primacy to principles of rationality, objectivity and narrative coherence, and by privileging that which is visually represented, the decision serves an ideological purpose which diminishes the significance of race in the construction of knowledge.
Legal positivism identifies the knowing subject and the object of knowledge as discrete entities. However, I argue that in Cubillo, Justice O&#65533;Loughlin inscribes himself into the text of the judgment and in doing so, reveals the way in which textual and corporeal specificities undermine the pretence of objective judgment and therefore the source of judicial authority.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stolen generations Australia</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians Legal status laws</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australian Children Government policy</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians Removal</field><field name="subject">Legal Judgments Northern Territory</field><field name="subject">Cubillo</field><field name="subject">Lorna</field><field name="subject">Gunner</field><field name="subject">Peter</field><field name="subject">Australia Federal Court Gunner v Commonwealth of Australia</field><field name="subject">Australia Federal Court Cubillo v Commonwealth of Australia</field><field name="subject">Reconciliation Australia</field><field name="subject">Evidence legal</field><field name="subject">Testimony legal</field><field name="subject">Critical legal theory</field><field name="subject">Jurisprudence feminist</field><field name="subject">Whiteness</field><field name="subject">Textual analysis law</field><field name="subject">Subjectivity judicial</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20080305.105209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Victorian Volunteer Force
on the central Victorian Goldfields,
1858-1883</field><field name="creator">Marmion, Bob</field><field name="description">During the 19th century, defence was a major issue in Victoria as indeed it was in other
British colonies and the United Kingdom. To help defend themselves, self governing
colonies throughout the Empire enlisted local citizens to serve as part time soldiers on
a voluntary basis.
The Victorian government in 1859 - 60 took a calculated risk in adopting a Volunteer
Force to underpin the whole colonial defence scheme, particularly as the military
effectiveness of the citizen soldiers was questionable due to the lack of any real
discipline within the Force and the part time nature of the military service. Whilst the
savings which resulted (from using Volunteers rather than expensive Imperial troops)
were spent on building forts and purchasing ordnance to protect Port Phillip Bay, there
were other advantages to be gained from the government decision. It harnessed the
considerable groundswell of public patriotism and pride in the Empire to ensure the
development of a colonial society with strong links to Britain.
The Government also linked Volunteering, stability and patriotism together as part of
a less obvious agenda for the goldfields. In a period of lingering unrest only a few
short years after Eureka, the Volunteers provided a clear indication of government
power and yet another sign (along with the judicial system, education, language) of the
importance and expanse of British society. Should there be any civil unrest on the
goldfields, the local Corps were ideally suited to the role of civil control. On a number
of occasions, the Volunteer Corps were called out to maintain law and order.
The thesis studies a major group of over 5,100 men on the goldfields over two
decades, particularly with regard to their motives for joining the Volunteers and their
demographics such as ages, occupations, addresses, activities and the networks
between members. By addressing the Corps demographics it is possible to understand
the role played by the Volunteers in the development of goldfields society.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Defence</field><field name="subject">Colonial defences</field><field name="subject">Volunteer militia</field><field name="subject">Military service</field><field name="subject">Voluntary service</field><field name="subject">Victorian military</field><field name="subject">Victorian defences</field><field name="subject">goldfields society</field><field name="subject">Central Victoria</field><field name="subject">civil power</field><field name="subject">Victorian society and the military</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20050430.150445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population demographics of New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri)</field><field name="creator">McKenzie, Jane</field><field name="description">Assessment of trophic interactions between increasing populations of New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri) and fisheries in southern Australia is limited due to a lack of species specific demographic data and an understanding of the factors influencing population growth. To establish species specific demographic parameters a cross-sectional sample of New Zealand fur seal females (330) and males (100) were caught and individually-marked on Kangaroo Island, South Australia between 2000 and 2003. The seals were aged through examination of a postcanine tooth, which was removed from each animal to investigate age-specific life-history parameters. Annual formation of cementum layers was confirmed and accuracy in age estimation was determined by examination of teeth removed from individuals of known-age. Indirect methods of assessing reproductive maturity based on mammary teat characteristics indicated that females first gave birth between 4-8 years of age, with an average age at reproductive maturity of 5 years. Among reproductively mature females, age-specific reproductive rates increased rapidly between 4-7 years of age, reaching maximum rates of 70-81% between 8-13 years, and gradually decreased in older females. No females older than 22 years were recorded to pup. Age of first territory tenure in males ranged from 8-10 years. The oldest female and male were 25 and 19 years old, respectively. Post-weaning growth in females was monophasic, characterised by high growth rates in length and mass during the juvenile growth stage, followed by a gradual decline in growth rates after reproductive maturity. In contrast, growth in males was biphasic and displayed a secondary growth spurt in both length and mass, which coincided with sexual and social maturation, followed by a rapid decline in growth rates. Age-specific survival rates were high (0.823-0.953) among prime-age females (8-13 yrs of age) and declined in older females. Relative change in annual pup production was strongly correlated with reproductive rates of prime-age females and adult female survival between breeding seasons.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand fur seal</field><field name="subject">Kangaroo Island - South Australia</field><field name="subject">New Zealand fur seal - Population viability analysis</field><field name="subject">New Zealand fur seal - Breeding</field><field name="subject">Fisheries - South Australia - Environmental variability</field><field name="subject">Marine mammal populations</field><field name="subject">Pinniped</field><field name="subject">otarid</field><field name="subject">remote chemical immobilization</field><field name="subject">darting</field><field name="subject">anaesthesia</field><field name="subject">isoflurane</field><field name="subject">midazolam</field><field name="subject">zoletil</field><field name="subject">tiletamine-zolazepam</field><field name="subject">restraint</field><field name="subject">behavioral response</field><field name="subject">fecundity</field><field name="subject">pregnancy rates</field><field name="subject">progesterone</field><field name="subject">reproduction</field><field name="subject">reproductive failure</field><field name="subject">site fidelity</field><field name="subject">mortality</field><field name="subject">territorial</field><field name="subject">size dimorphism</field><field name="subject">life table</field><field name="subject">ageing</field><field name="subject">growth layer groups</field><field name="subject">re-colonization</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20080509.121141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A longer working life for Australian women of the baby boom generation? &#65533; Women&#65533;s voices and the social policy implications of an ageing female workforce</field><field name="creator">Merkes, Monika</field><field name="description">With an increasing proportion of older people in the Australian population and increasing health and longevity, paid work after the age of 65 years may become an option or a necessity in the future. The focus of this research is on Australian women of the baby boom generation, their working futures, and the work-retirement decision. This is explored both from the viewpoint of women and from a social policy perspective. The research draws on Considine&#65533;s model of public policy, futures studies, and Beck&#65533;s concept of risk society. The research comprises three studies. Using focus group research, Study 1 explored the views of Australian women of the baby boom generation on work after the age of 65 years. Study 2 aimed to explore current thinking on the research topic in Australia and overseas. Computer-mediated communication involving an Internet website and four scenarios for the year 2020 were used for this study. Study 3 consists of the analysis of quantitative data from the Healthy Retirement Project, focusing on attitudes towards retirement, retirement plans, and the preferred and expected age of retirement. The importance of choice and a work &#65533; life balance emerged throughout the research. Women in high-status occupations were found to be more likely to be open to the option of continuing paid work beyond age 65 than women in low-status jobs. However, the women were equally likely to embrace future volunteering. The research findings suggest that policies for an ageing female workforce should be based on the values of inclusiveness, fairness, self-determination, and social justice, and address issues of workplace flexibility, equality in the workplace, recognition for unpaid community and caring work, opportunities for life-long learning, complexity and inequities of the superannuation system, and planning for retirement. Further, providing a guaranteed minimum income for all Australians should be explored as a viable alternative to the current social security system.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">labor supply-Australia</field><field name="subject">life span-productive</field><field name="subject">age and employment-Australia</field><field name="subject">women employees</field><field name="subject">baby boom generation-Australia</field><field name="subject">women's rights</field><field name="subject">retired women-Australia</field><field name="subject">retirees</field><field name="subject">female workforce</field><field name="subject">retirement</field><field name="subject">futures studies</field><field name="subject">scenario planning</field><field name="subject">Internet research</field><field name="subject">qualitative research</field><field name="subject">online research</field><field name="subject">public health research</field><field name="subject">population</field><field name="subject">retirement planning</field><field name="subject">retirement income</field><field name="subject">retirement savings</field><field name="subject">seniors</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">older women</field><field name="subject">computer mediated communication</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20051103.104704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE HUMAN COSTS AND BENEFITS OF WORK: JOBLOAD, SELF-PERCEIVED PERFORMANCE, AND EMPLOYEE WELLBEING.</field><field name="creator">Miller, Peta</field><field name="description">The primary purpose of this project was to investigate some relationships between workload and employee wellbeing.  The necessary first stage was to formulate a theoretical framework &#65533; the JobLoad Model &#65533; to support a comprehensive and detailed investigation of the main factors that contribute to a job's workload.  Building on the ergonomics concept of &#65533;workload&#65533;, this Model incorporates task- and job-level factors that have been identified within the research literatures of physical and cognitive ergonomics as important; additional constructs were added to take account of additional factors shown to be relevant to employee wellbeing, drawing on evidence from occupational health and organizational psychology literatures. Using this framework, available questionnaire-based measurement instruments for assessing workload and employee wellbeing were reviewed, new items were developed as required, and the JobLoad Index (JLI) was developed.
The JLI was used to collect data from public servants in two different workplaces, with participation rates of 63% and 73% respectively.  Relationships were determined between major task, job and organisational environment factors, self-perceived performance adequacy, and various aspects of employee wellbeing including job satisfaction, physical discomfort and psychological fatigue, stress and arousal. For a sub-sample of participants in one of the two workplaces, levels of adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol were also measured from 24-hour urine collections.
The factors measured by the JLI accounted for a very substantial proportion of variance in these various dimensions of work-related wellbeing.  The results provide potentially very useful insights into the relative influences of a wide range of work- and job-related variables on people's perceived abilities to cope with their job demands, and on several aspects of their wellbeing.  Further, the importance of measuring multiple dimensions of wellbeing, and differentiating their separate sets of work-related determinants, was well demonstrated.  Finally, and perhaps most significantly, this study has identified the powerful role that self-perceived performance plays as an intervening variable between job demands and people's work-related wellbeing.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Workload</field><field name="subject">fatigue</field><field name="subject">body part discomfort</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">self rated performance capacity</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">cortisol</field><field name="subject">adrenaline</field><field name="subject">noradrenaline</field><field name="subject">job content</field><field name="subject">job control</field><field name="subject">support.</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20070319.145144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">JUDGEMENTS AS SOCIAL NARRATIVE:
AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION OF APPEAL JUDGEMENTS IN CLOSELY CONTESTED PARENTING DISPUTES 
IN THE FAMILY COURT OF AUSTRALIA 1988 &#65533; 1999</field><field name="creator">Moloney, Lawrence</field><field name="description">The thesis is divided into two sections. Section 1 explores the psycho-social and legal constructions of family, parenting and children that have influenced judicial decision-making in parenting disputes following separation and divorce. Particular attention is paid, first, to the circumstances surrounding the shift from paternal to maternally-based presumptions about the parenting of children; and second, to the more recent and somewhat puzzling shift to a presumption of gender neutrality. The extent to which fault has continued as a less overt decision-making criterion is also considered.
	In Section 2, judgements in recent closely contested parenting cases in the Family Court of Australia are analysed as contemporary socio-legal narratives. A systematic, in-depth examination of a heterogeneous sample of publicly accessible cases revealed that gender-based assumptions continue to dominate judicial thinking about parenting and family structure. In particular, it was found that outcomes that favoured mothers correlated with perceived evidence of conformity to a maternal stereotype of self-sacrifice on behalf of the child(ren). Outcomes favouring fathers usually resulted from situations in which mothers were judged to fall short of these stereotyped expectations. Fathers&#65533; roles, even in cases in which their applications were successful, generally continued to be equated with breadwinning and support. Their capacities as nurturers to their children were either not mentioned or treated with scepticism.
	In the light of the findings, tensions between continuing gender-based roles in families, public attitudes to parenting and preferred family structure, and recent changes in our scientific knowledge base regarding gender and parenting are reviewed. Implications of the persistence of the breadwinning/nurturing dichotomy both within the Australian culture and family court judgements are discussed. Particular attention is drawn to the impact of the confused circumstances in which gender-neutral parenting principles came about in the 1970s.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Divorce - Social aspects - Australia</field><field name="subject">Family law - Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Custody of children</field><field name="subject">Decision making</field><field name="subject">construction of parenting</field><field name="subject">construction of childhood</field><field name="subject">Family</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20070411.144416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of values on development practice: A study of Cambodian development practitioners in non-government organisations in Cambodia</field><field name="creator">O'Leary, Moira Patricia</field><field name="description">Evaluation reports, along with development studies literature suggest that development practice is often failing to enact espoused participatory, empowering and gender equitable approaches or to achieve these espoused goals. Mainstream development theories are underpinned by values and beliefs about what is good and what &#65533;ought to be&#65533;.
In this study I explore the influence of values on the development practice of Cambodian practitioners working in non-government organisations in rural Cambodia. Development practitioners are the major conduit of community based development assistance, but little is known about how their values impact their day-to-day practice, and influence their moral and political choices.
In the study I used ethnographic methodology, guided by feminist principles. The research was conducted with individuals and groups of experienced, mostly Cambodian development practitioners. Data were collected in four phases through in-depth and semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and observations of practice.
I examine the (in)congruity between practitioners&#65533; espoused theories and values and those demonstrated by their practice. The findings reveal that the values are not essentially different but are prioritized differently. The espoused values are consistent with those of the international development discourse, all of which are premised on a belief in human equality. Theories and values inferred from actual practice reflect hierarchical underpinnings. In the Cambodian context this is consistent with socio-cultural values and the hierarchical order of society. However, as expatriate research participants and the literature attest, this incongruence is not particular to Cambodian practitioners.
The study reveals practitioners give higher priority to fulfilling the tasks necessary for the achievement of their NGOs&#65533; planned outputs and organisational imperatives than to the facilitation of participatory and empowering processes. At the same time, the enactment of some development values is in tension with certain socio-cultural norms and practices. Practitioners are challenged to make desirable development values explicit and identify how to operationalise them in the lived social, cultural, political and economic context.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">values</field><field name="subject">development practice</field><field name="subject">NGOs</field><field name="subject">development practitioners</field><field name="subject">Cambodia</field><field name="subject">development values</field><field name="subject">community development</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20061025.123141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Looking for good practice and optimal services for youth facing homelessness with complex care needs and high risk or challenging behaviour.</field><field name="creator">Owen, Lloyd</field><field name="description">This study employed qualitative research methodology informed by the grounded theory tradition to explore good practice and optimal services for young people presenting with complex care needs associated with challenging or high risk behaviour.  In-depth interviews were conducted in three waves of data collection and analysis with fourteen experienced practitioners whose careers have included sustained periods of work with this group in a number of selected Victorian service systems.
The principal vantage point was the interface between the supported accommodation and assistance programs for homeless young people, statutory child protection and care, placement and support programs for young people at risk and juvenile justice programs for young offenders.  The nature of the problem necessarily included some consideration of mental health and services dealing with substance abuse.
The findings propose a view of good practice giving emphasis to the accessible and assertive presence of a responsible adult to &#65533;be there&#65533; fostering relationships and skilled purposive intervention. Intervention should be planned, holistic, sensitive and responsive to particular needs. It provides active unconditional care. It attends to attachment and trauma concerns and works with short run goals and a long term perspective. Intervention is sustained until constructive disengagement can occur. 
The complexity and challenge in the task of helping hurt youth warrants the support, strength and guidance of a multi-skilled team. Ideally the team will be described using normative terms. Optimal services are timely, congruent, seamless and robust in capacity to nurture, establish boundaries and meet developmental and therapeutic requirements. They should be connected to a community and there for as long as it takes, with ready access to suitable accommodation, purchasing power and flexibility of operation. To the greatest extent possible solutions are generated in the place where help is sought. Voluntary service commitment lasts till personal capacity and natural networks take over.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adolescence</field><field name="subject">social inclusion</field><field name="subject">social exclusion</field><field name="subject">parenting adolescents</field><field name="subject">crisis intervention</field><field name="subject">multiple and complex needs</field><field name="subject">social work</field><field name="subject">youth work</field><field name="subject">welfare work</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20090121.152022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Niche partitioning among fur seals</field><field name="creator">Page, Brad</field><field name="description">At Cape Gantheaume, Kangaroo Island (South Australia), adult male, lactating female
and juvenile New Zealand (NZ) and Australian fur seals regularly return to the same
colony, creating the potential for intra- and inter-specific foraging competition in nearby
waters. I hypothesised that these demographic groups would exhibit distinct foraging
strategies, which reduce competition and facilitate their coexistence. I analysed the diet
of adult male, adult female and juvenile NZ fur seals and adult male Australian fur seals
and studied the diving behaviour of adult male and lactating female NZ fur seals and the
at-sea movements of juvenile, adult male and lactating female NZ fur seals. Female diet
reflected that of a generalist predator, influenced by prey availability and their
dependant pups&#65533; fasting abilities. In contrast, adult male NZ and Australian fur seals
used larger and more energy-rich prey, most likely because they could more efficiently
access and handle such prey. Juvenile fur seals primarily utilised small lantern fish,
which occur south of the shelf break, in pelagic waters. Juveniles undertook the longest
foraging trips and adult males conducted more lengthy trips than lactating females,
which perform relatively brief trips in order to regularly nurse their pups. Unlike lactating
females, some adult males appeared to rest underwater by performing dives that were
characterised by a period of passive drifting through the water column. The large body
sizes of adult males and lactating females facilitated the use of both benthic and pelagic
habitats, but adult males dived deeper and for longer than lactating females, facilitating
vertical separation of their foraging habitats. Spatial overlap in foraging habitats among
the age/sex groups was minimal, because lactating females typically utilised continental
shelf waters and males used deeper water over the shelf break, beyond female foraging
grounds. Furthermore, juveniles used pelagic waters, up to 1000 km south of the
regions used by lactating females and adult males. The age and sex groups in this
study employed dramatically different strategies to maximise their survival and
reproductive success. Their prey and foraging habitats are likely to be shaped by body
size differences, which determine their different physiological constraints and metabolic
requirements. I suggest that these physiological constraints and the lactation
constraints on females are the primary factors that reduce competition, thereby
facilitating niche partitioning.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine mammals</field><field name="subject">Southern fur seals Heard Island</field><field name="subject">Arctocephalus forsteri</field><field name="subject">satellite telemetry</field><field name="subject">dive recorders</field><field name="subject">Niche (Ecology)</field><field name="subject">drift dive</field><field name="subject">Heard Island</field><field name="subject">entanglement</field><field name="subject">Neophoca Heard Island</field><field name="subject">Sea lions South Australia</field><field name="subject">Competition (Biology) Heard Island</field><field name="subject">Resource partitioning (Ecology) Heard Island</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20060622.153716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Landscape Painting: Connection, Perception and Attention.</field><field name="creator">Parker, Margaret Ina</field><field name="description">I investigate the lived experience, the actuality of responding to land as a painter. This thesis consists of intensive investigations in the field and further exploration in the studio, resulting in a body of paintings and drawings which form the exhibition. The exegesis explores theories and ideas surrounding the work. The psychological engagement between people, land and art is of major concern. The choice of place selected to paint and the subject matter of rocks is discussed. Painters who work outside or have painted at the same site are considered for comparison with my working methods or concerns. The selective view is intimate. The format of the image and the composition are discussed in terms of proximity and space. 
Consideration of the psychology of engagement with land and landscape painting, either as an observer or painter, is a major component of the research. This examination of human psychological development illuminates the origin of our sense of self and how we relate to the land on which we live. The premise of this enquiry is the idea that art and culture could reflect human psychological development. Do art objects contribute to cultural understanding of the relationship of person to environment? A phenomenological perspective is incorporated in this exploration of the interrelation of vision, perception and attention. Can the reality of experience be transferred into the art work? The deep attention to the landscape of Australian Aboriginal people serves as a cultural reference for these investigations. 
This study concludes that sentient consciousness involving responsibility for land is an open, effective way of perceiving and depicting landscape. Responsibility for land can be encouraged by the development of cultural ideas based around landscape and can be the result of feeling connected to land. Art can contribute to changes in attitudes to land.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lina Bryans</field><field name="subject">Philip Hunter</field><field name="subject">D.W.Winnicott</field><field name="subject">Australian landscape painting.</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20080225.113947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Caring for dying parents : an existential phenomenological approach</field><field name="creator">Paul, Lindsay</field><field name="description">The death of one&#65533;s parents, irrespective of the age at which it occurs, is generally regarded as a life experience of considerable significance. The last few years of an elderly person&#65533;s life are often characterized by increasing frailty, declining health and loss of independence. Responsibility for the spiritual and physical care of parents during that period is undertaken by many adult children. Current research in this area is generally informed by the requirements of social policy, which, by identifying and addressing the inherent difficulties in this so-called informal caring, is designed to support carers in the community. The research reported in this thesis represents a departure from this mode of inquiry and seeks, rather, to explore the existential aspects of caring in this particular situation, from the carer&#65533;s perspective. 

To achieve this objective, an existential phenomenological approach informed principally by the philosophies of Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, and the adaptation of these philosophies by Schutz, Giorgi and van Manen to social science research, was developed to suit the particular requirements of the topic. In addition to the author&#65533;s autobiographic material, primary sources include conversations with five people who had been principal carers for their parents during their final illnesses. In all cases caring had ended with the parent&#65533;s death at least one year before the conversations took place. The principal secondary sources are Simone de Beauvoir&#65533;s memoir, A Very Easy Death, and Philip Roth&#65533;s account of his father&#65533;s illness and death, Patrimony: A True Story. In addition, the argument is supported throughout by reference to other literary works. From these sources a number of major existential themes, including temporality, hope, suffering, and knowing the body, have been explored in depth, in conjunction with relevant existential theories. Synthesis of these topics suggests that in this particular circumstance, for the people involved in the study, the phenomenon of caring can be understood as an unconditional engagement with the life and concerns of their parent at the end of life, and can be interpreted within an existential framework as representing an authentic way of Being.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Existential phenomenology</field><field name="subject">nursing theory</field><field name="subject">hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">medical imaging technology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20080222.152124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Postcranial Skeleton of Temnospondyls (Tetrapoda: Temnospondyli)</field><field name="creator">Pawley, Kat</field><field name="description">Temnospondyls are large extinct fossil tetrapods; superficially resembling crocodiles in their general size, appearance and lifestyle.

The thesis consists of a series of published articles, three describing the postcranial skeletons of various temnospondyls, and three summary articles, all with extensive illustrations.

To provide data, the postcranial skeletons of three temnospondyl taxa were described. The articulated postcranial skeleton of a basal stereospondyl (rhinesuchid) is immature, and paedomorphism of the postcranial skeleton in stereospondyls is discussed. The robust appendicular skeleton of Eryops megacephalus is plesiomorphic, well-ossified, and terrestrially adapted. The paedomorphic postcranial skeleton of Trimerorhachis insignis is plesiomorphic, and secondarily aquatic, the description includes growth stages.

This study found that extensive morphogenetic variation is present in the postcranial skeleton of temnospondyls. Many phylogenetically significant characteristics develop with morphogenesis, they may be absent in early growth stages, and may never develop even in the largest growth stages of taxa with paedomorphic postcranial skeletons. Consequently, assessment of the presence or absence of a phylogenetically significant characteristic in any taxon may be dependant on the morphogenetic stage of the specimen examined. This finding has major implications for the phylogenetic analysis of temnospondyls and other early tetrapods. 

An overview of phylogenetic variation in the postcranial skeleton is presented, including a large phylogenetic analysis of the Temnospondyli. The most primitive temnospondyls possess fully ossified postcranial skeletons, well adapted for terrestrial locomotion, but some of the derived clades of temnospondyls have paedomorphic postcranial skeletons and are exclusively aquatic.

For the first time, the postcranial skeleton of temnospondyls is comprehensively compared with that of other early tetrapods in the largest phylogenetic analysis to date, resulting in the unexpected discovery that temnospondyls are most closely related to the ancestors of amniotes. The Temnospondyli plus Neospondyli (Seymouriamorpha plus Cotylosauria plus Lepospondyli) forms a large new clade, the Terrapoda, defined by the presence of many derived synapomorphies. Some of the cranial synapomorphies of the Terrapoda are most likely related to improvements in hearing. The postcranial synapomorphies indicate that the Terrapoda are the first vertebrates to have evolved limbs that are well adapted for terrestrial locomotion. The Terrapoda are the first truly terrestrial vertebrates, their postcranial adaptations facilitated their colonisation of the land and consequent phylogenetic radiation during the early Carboniferous.

Both analyses incorporate characters from previous analyses and many new postcranial characters. The results of the phylogenetic analyses are statistically more parsimonious than previous analyses and have much lower levels of homoplasy. Comparative analyses indicate that the distinctive results are most likely due to the increased use of characters pertaining to temnospondyls, increased use of postcranial characters, and differentiation between sources of morphological variation to minimise morphogenetic and phenotypic variation and elucidate true phylogenetic signal.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cladistics</field><field name="subject">early tetrapod</field><field name="subject">morphogenesis</field><field name="subject">morphology</field><field name="subject">phylogeny</field><field name="subject">postcranial temnospondyl</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20061124.124055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Counsellor's Self in Therapy</field><field name="creator">Reupert, Andrea E.</field><field name="description">The person of the counsellor, or what is sometimes referred to as the counsellor&#65533;s self, is the focus of this thesis.  How the counsellor&#65533;s self is described and manifested during therapy constitute the two main research questions.  Various perspectives are presented from psychoanalysis, behaviour therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy, person centered therapy and systems therapy.  While issues pertaining to the counsellor&#65533;s self have been explored predominately by systems therapists, this study extends previous research by involving interviews with counsellors from a range of orientations.

The study is conducted within an interpretative research paradigm, and data are collected and interpreted according to a qualitative approach.  Semi-structured interviews with 16 counsellors, from a range of theoretical orientations, constitute the primary method of data collection.  Other data sources include a short questionnaire sent to the same counsellors, the researcher&#65533;s reflective journal as well as recorded meetings between a peer debriefer and the researcher.  

Study participants describe the counsellor&#65533;s self as a multifaceted, positive and integrated entity.  The counsellor&#65533;s self includes participant&#65533;s professional knowledge and skills as well as their beliefs, values, thoughts, feelings, personal style and an unknown aspect of self that some participants referred to as their unconscious.  While somewhat influenced by past relationships and the client, the counsellor&#65533;s self is primarily autonomous and defined by the individual counsellor.  Although the counsellor&#65533;s self has the capacity to change over time, in different environments and with different clients, the self also includes notions of stability and consistency.  The counsellor&#65533;s self is involved in therapy as an inevitable presence, a deliberate tool and a stance.  Participants highlighted the importance of self-awareness and various professional and personal constraints on the involvement of self.  A central function of the self in therapy is in the therapeutic alliance.

The study has implications for the training and supervision of counsellors and future psychotherapeutic research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">counsellor&#65533;s self</field><field name="subject">person of the therapist</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20050404.161132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A STUDY OF THE PERCEPTIONS OF PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN THE SERVICE DELIVERY IMPLEMENTATION OF MULTICULTURAL POLICIES IN THE CONTRACTUAL ENVIRONMENT OF COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES IN THE NORTHERN METROPOLITAN REGION OF MELBOURNE</field><field name="creator">Ruzzene, Nora</field><field name="description">This study investigated the nexus between multicultural policies and contract management within the Community Health Services in the Northern Metropolitan Region of the Victorian Department of Human Services. Access and equity of services to linguistic minority migrant groups is a central component of this study.

The study drew on literature pertaining to social work theory and practice, with a particular focus on structural social work, the evolution of Australia's multicultural policy and the context of contract management.

The data collection consisted of two stages. The first stage comprised of twenty-two semi-structured interviews with Chief Executive Officers and managers from the Community Health Services, government personnel from the Department of Human Services and key informants. The second stage of the study, a self administered questionnaire survey for service providers, was developed and designed from the key themes identified from the interviewee data. A total of 119 service providers responded to the questionnaire. 

Key findings of this study were first, that the Community Health Services have broad policies of inclusion. Secondly, that the multicultural policy may be considered a broader policy then just a policy relating to people of non-English speaking backgrounds or culture relating to ethnicity. Thirdly, funding arrangements appeared limited in their expectations regarding linguistic accessibility. Fourthly, service providers had a different perception of the quality level of service their organisation provided to English speakers and non-English speakers.

Implications of this study included, first, having broad inclusive policies would require specific strategies of access. Secondly, multicultural policy as such may need to develop into a policy of 'structural cultural equity'. Thirdly, partnerships between government and Community Health Services can be further utilised to develop more innovative service delivery methods to respond to linguistic minority groups. Lastly, culturally sensitive practice modules may need to be considered as a central component in the health and welfare field of tertiary education.

The study concluded that Community Health Services are ideally located to implement services, which not only address the notion of multiculturalism, but also address the issues of equity in the context of a dominant paradigm.  In such an environment someone who speaks a language other than English is 'visible' and therefore, 'a woman without a word of English enters the Community Health Service' and receives the same service as an English speaker.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community health services</field><field name="subject">Multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">Minorities</field><field name="subject">Multiculturalism and organisations</field><field name="subject">Health service agreements</field><field name="subject">Corporate culture</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20050718.131455</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The employment relationship and integrated theory</field><field name="creator">Sansbury, George Ernest</field><field name="description">This research falls within the field of normative business ethics. 
Its aim is to examine the moral nature of the employment relationship in western democracies by examining the liberal, democratic justifications that are normally advanced for its probity. Its concern is to challenge the notion that the employment relationship is in conformity with these liberal democratic values. Thus, the research is an exercise in the examination of the application of the liberal, democratic tradition to the social institution of employment.
Thus research examines areas of dissonance between the political relationship of employee &#65533; employer and the dominant values of the liberal tradition found elsewhere in western democracies.
The research firstly identifies the key moral characteristics of the employment relationship in private, capitalist organisations. This is derived from a consideration of the development historically, of the employment relationship, with acknowledgement of the combined influences of statute, common law, contract law and custom in forming the current employee relationship. 
Secondly, the research identifies the justificatory arguments from the liberal tradition that are normally advanced in support of the employment relationship&#65533;s moral probity. These include notions of rights deriving from private property, the separation of social life into public and private spheres and the application of contract law to employment.
Thirdly, the research examines these arguments for their moral probity. Specifically, this involves an examination of the arguments regarding the private property status of employing organisations, the application of contract law to employment, the moral characteristics of the master and servant relationship as a basis for employment and the relevance of democratic values within employment.
As an additional perspective, the literature on human needs is reviewed as a source, outside of the liberal tradition, for a basis upon which to outline the moral requirements of human relationships to work.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Master and servant - Moral and ethical aspects</field><field name="subject">Business ethics</field><field name="subject">Industrial relations - Moral and ethical aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20060427.125729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preservice teachers&#65533; views of similarities and differences in teaching and learning literacy and numeracy.</field><field name="creator">Scott, Anne</field><field name="description">This is a report of an investigation of aspects of preservice teachers&#65533; perceptions of teaching and learning English and mathematics and factors influencing them. 
The participants of the investigation were primary preservice teachers from two tertiary institutions of Victoria, one located inner city, and the other in a regional centre. Of the 349 participants, 163 were commencing and 186 were graduating from their degrees. 
Preservice teachers completed questionnaires indicating their intentions to use particular practices in their literacy and numeracy lessons. Thirty-one of the 349 surveyed voluntarily discussed key issues arising from the survey during semi-structured audiotaped sessions. Five lecturers responsible for the planning of the compulsory English and mathematics education units at both institutions were interviewed about the survey data and provided written documentation for their units as evidence of their coursework.
Data analyses indicated that preservice teachers often considered practices equally appropriate for literacy and numeracy teaching and intended to use them in similar ways. It seemed that preservice teachers enter their degrees with strong opinions about teaching and learning based not only on their recollections of experiences as learners but also from more recent relevant experiences such as their dealings with children as babysitters, tutors, and classroom helpers. They also gained knowledge about teaching contexts from their informal but regular conversations with friends and family who teach. 
From the examination of the documentation for coursework and discussions with lecturers, it seemed that the content of the literacy and numeracy education units at the two institutions were similar. Overall, the data indicated that many of the preservice teachers&#65533; intentions were consistent with the intent of coursework especially when they described general teaching practices. However, in cases where practices were discipline-specific there were limited changes in preservice teachers&#65533; intentions even after completing their courses. The prospective teachers reported that they considered their recent salient experiences of teaching and their observations of teachers&#65533; practices in schools more influential than coursework.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Survey research</field><field name="subject">Beliefs</field><field name="subject">Teacher education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20070815.163201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clerical Workers, Enterprise Bargaining and Preference Theory: Choice &amp; Constraint</field><field name="creator">Thomson, Lisa</field><field name="description">This thesis is a case study about the choices and constraints faced by women clerical workers in a labour market where they have very little autonomy in negotiating their pay and conditions of employment.  On the one hand, clerical work has developed as a feminised occupation with a history of being low in status and low paid.  On the other hand, it is an ideal occupation for women wanting to combine work and family across their life cycle.  How these two phenomena impact upon women clerical workers ability to negotiate enterprise agreements is the subject of this thesis.  

From a theoretical perspective this thesis builds upon Catherine Hakim&#65533;s preference theory which explores the choices women clerical workers&#65533; make in relation to their work and family lives.  Where Hakim&#65533;s preference theory focuses on the way in which women use their agency to determine their work and life style choices, this thesis gives equal weighting to the impact of agency and the constraints imposed by external structures such as the availability of part-time work and childcare, as well as the impact of organisational culture.  

The research data presented was based on face-to-face interviews with forty female clerical workers.  The clerical workers ranged in age from 21 to 59 years of age.  The respondents were made up of single or partnered women without family responsibilities, women juggling work and family, and women who no longer had dependent children and were approaching retirement.  This thesis contends that these clerical workers are ill placed to optimise their conditions of employment under the new industrial regime of enterprise bargaining and individual contracts.  Very few of the women were union members and generally they were uninformed about their rights and entitlements.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clerical work</field><field name="subject">Women clerical workers</field><field name="subject">Labor market Australia</field><field name="subject">Industrial relations Australia</field><field name="subject">Wages clerical workers</field><field name="subject">Child care</field><field name="subject">Part-time employment Australia</field><field name="subject">Enterprise bargaining Australia</field><field name="subject">Workplace contracts</field><field name="subject">Work and family Australia</field><field name="subject">Famly relationships</field><field name="subject">Corporate culture Australia</field><field name="subject">Preference theory</field><field name="subject">Women clerical workers unions</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20050801.172053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biological and molecular analysis of important agricultural pest species in southern Australia: Penthaleus species and Halotydeus destructor</field><field name="creator">Umina, Paul A.</field><field name="description">Blue oat mite species, Penthaleus spp. (Acari: Penthaleidae), and the redlegged earth mite, Halotydeus destructor (Tucker) (Acari: Penthaleidae), are some of the most serious and widespread agricultural pests in southern Australia. Management of these mites has been complicated by the recent discovery of three cryptic species of Penthaleus, whereas prior research had assumed a single species. The species differ markedly in their distribution, plant preferences and response to pesticides. This thesis looks at various aspects of the biology, ecology and molecular analyses of earth mites with particular emphasis on agricultural control.  

I tested the initiation of diapause egg production in mites using field and shade-house experiments. Halotydeus destructor has a very different diapause response from Penthaleus species. Thus, carefully timed spring sprays are unlikely to be effective against Penthaleus spp., highlighting the importance of correctly distinguishing earth mite species before implementing control strategies. There is also variation in diapause induction among the three Penthaleus spp. that could contribute to their relative distributions and pest status. 

I examined the effects of different plant hosts on the persistence and reproduction of earth mites. The results are consistent with field observations that mite species differ in their host plants. For all species, pasture is a suitable host and lentils are generally a poor host plant. Canola, ox-tongue, and a mixture of wheat and oats differ in their suitability as long-term hosts for each mite species. This information is important for developing more sustainable management practices, such as weed management and crop rotations.  

Competitive interactions between earth mites were also investigated in the field and the laboratory over a number of seasons. In order to make valid conclusions with an applied implication, competition was examined on four different plant treatments: pasture, canola, wheat/oats and ox-tongue. I showed that close competition exists between mite species and that competitive interactions differ temporally and on different plant types. 

Finally, I undertook biochemical analysis of Penthaleus spp. for the development of a rapid and simple field test that could be used by agronomists and farmers to distinguish the different mite species on individual properties. This would allow appropriate control strategies to be devised, as well as reduce the ineffectual application of pesticides. Using mostly immunological techniques, I revealed important information about the complex nature of the Penthaleus group, the similarity between the three species, as well as develop methods for isolating and characterising species-specific proteins.

The objective of the study is to provide both syntactic and pragmatic factors which are determining for the word order of the language and to open new ways to recording mechanisms of word order change. 

Cypriot syntax deserves this attention, as it is a language highly interesting for the typologist as for the researcher of other linguistic areas; Modern Cypriot is VOS, and exhibits a series of exceptions to the general rules of V-initial languages. Medieval Cypriot conforms to most of Greenberg&#65533;s Universals (1963) which are pertinent to type VSO in that it has V in initial position in all unmarked clauses, in that it is prepositional, that adjectives mostly follow the noun they qualify, and so on. 
     However, the comparison of MC to Greenberg&#65533;s Universals is not the aim of this work. Apart form the order of the main constituents, this research mainly focuses on revealing mechanisms of syntactic change not generally known, and on unveiling particular traits of the Cypriot VSO order that are not common to other VSO languages.

The analysis can be defined as diachronic for it deals with the language written over a span of many years, as assumed from studying the texts. Some words and structures, used in the beginning of the narrative, seem to decrease in frequency in the end, or vice versa. It is diachronic considering it also allows for comparison with later (colloquial) and earlier (written) constructions of the language. However, it is mostly a synchronic analysis; the patterns observed are from within the same language spoken by the same people living in the same period, more importantly from within the same work. Makhairas is thus the only broad evidence of his period, offered both as a diachronic and a synchronic linguistic testimony of his time. 

As no language exists in vacuo, my description of MC starts with a historical approach to the language under study; it is almost impossible to realise the problems of colloquial, literary and foreign features without being aware of the earlier history of Greek in general and of Cypriot in particular, in some of its earlier documents. I refrained as far as possible from entering the field of comparative criticism with Medieval Greek. In this way I decided to focus on discussions based exclusively on the Cypriot forms and patterns, as presented and justified by the evidence in Makhairas, and as witnessed by history which, for many centuries, has singled out Cypriot from the rest of the dialects and the Greek language itself. So, alternative views, criticism and discussion of same mechanisms of change recorded within the broader Greek language have been more or less avoided. 

The exposition of the MC word order patterns is based on my hypotheses that word order, as I understand it, is founded on purposes of communication and that languages with extreme flexibility of order, such as Medieval Cypriot, may adopt patterns that display rigidity of order in a number of their elements. It is within these areas of rigidity that new mechanisms of change may be detected. I also hypothesised that the same syntactic changes within languages of the same branch may be merely coincidental, and that Greek or forms of Greek may well adopt foreign elements, only (but not exclusively) if these acquire the Greek endings, or if they appear as independent affixes, as is the case with the post-medieval referential Cypriot marker &#65533;mish&#65533; which is from Turkish. Acquiring particular elements from other languages does not mean acquiring their order. However, acquiring patterns that are similar to Greek from a borrowing language which has the same patterns does not exclude syntactic borrowing.  

Since Modern Cypriot is V-initial, I presumed that this might have also been its order in the Middle Ages. I judge that major mechanisms of syntactic change of the same period may have been triggered by factors internal to Cypriot rather than by the more general, universal mechanisms of change. Moreover, I speculated that MC was a far more marginalised language in the Middle Ages than what history and literature have taught us. Its creative dynamism and potentiality to &#65533;juggle&#65533; between words and patterns has been its greater forte. 

Cypriot has not been studied as a dialect, in this work. I avoided having only a partial or a shadowed understanding of its word order patterns. Exhaustive descriptions that show its particularities in the process of completion appear with both rigidity (in some elements) and flexibility of order, and most importantly, they exhibit a long-life endurance. 

I have also been concerned with forms and /or patterns of Greek such as the future and other periphrastic tenses, although they are already known and have been analysed at length in Greek linguistic studies. I concentrate here on some of these from a Cypriot perspective. 

Cypriot has never been classified as Balkan Greek or mainland Greek. Following this study, it will be clarified further that any attempt to fit MC into a framework defined along these categorisations will be successful only in some areas of the general Greek syntax. In fact, Cypriot opens the way for a further understanding of Greek syntax with its (almost) boundless flexibility; it is through MC and the unique data of Makhairas that the study of the Greek syntax is being enriched. Areas of fine-grained classificatory criteria result in connecting some MC syntactic traits to those of Greek and accrediting to the language its own word order singularities in what can be righteously called here the Cypriot syntax. 
Additionally, the study aims to open new areas of investigation on diachronic syntactic issues and to initiate new and revealing answers concerning configurational syntax.
  
To determine the syntactic traits of MC a meticulous work of counting was needed. The counting of the order of the main constituents from both the more general narrative patterns of the Chronicle as well as of those passages thought to be more immediate to the author&#65533;s living experience(s) was done manually. The primarily and more difficult task of considering, following and explaining pragmatic word order patterns in the Chronicle has been the stepping stone of this research. Earlier (and forgotten) stages of Greek, and patterns exclusive to Cypriot, assembled in a unique lexicon and with special Cypriot phrasal verbs, have provided answers to explaining the Cypriot structure. In addition to statistics, areas of language contact have also been explored, both in the morphology and in the syntax.
More importantly, the extreme word order freedom of MC that illustrates word order processes based entirely on internal structural changes, aims to contribute to discussions regarding morphology and syntax versus morphosyntax.

Chapter 1 provides all the background information of the history and language in Cyprus, prior to the Middle Ages. 
Chapter 2 deals with the description of the data and the methodology used to assess them. 
Chapter 3 exhibits the MC verbal forms, both finite and non-finite; it examines non-finites more closely, inasmuch as they play an important role in the change of the order of major constituents and uncover and explain the role of V-initial structures. 
Chapter 4 is the core chapter of this work. It displays Cypriot particularities of word order, reveals data concerned with the word order of the major constituents within the clause and unfolds explanatory accounts of them; lastly, it classifies MC as a V-initial language.
Chapter 5 summarises conclusions, adds a further note on the Cypriot morphosyntactic traits while placing the results into the contemporary scholarship on VSO languages, also suggesting additional research areas into the MC patterns. 

The examples from Makhairas have been written in the monotonic system, where only one accent has been used; other special symbols have been eliminated or modified in the interest of making the text readable in the absence of the right font. However, Ancient Greek words appear with their appropriate accents.  
Abbreviation C indicates structures or words that remained unchanged in Cypriot over a long period of time, and G means a form or word accepted in both their written and spoken forms over a long period of time in Greek. 

A morphemic analysis of each form of the glosses has not always been given.

The patterns in alpine vegetation across the study sites were described in relation to abiotic environmental factors. Temperatures were lower and precipitation was higher at the high altitude sites. The vegetation did not differ significantly between the sites, although sites at low altitudes were shrubbier than those at high altitudes. Analysis of the soil seed bank revealed high mean densities of germinable seed (80 to 1400 seeds m-2) across the gradient of sites. The similarity between the seed bank samples and the standing vegetation was low (qualitative similarity: 0.08 to 0.2; quantitative similarity: 0.03 to 0.19).
 In laboratory germination experiments, I found rapid and substantial germination. Final percent germination was above 90% for most species. One species, Aciphylla glacialis, showed evidence of dormancy mechanisms. In subsequent experiments, I found that innate primary seed dormancy in this species could be broken with cold-wet stratification.
There were no significant patterns in natural seedling recruitment across the altitudinal gradient. Similarities between the seedling flora and the standing vegetation
were low (qualitative similarity: 0.18 to 0.45: quantitative similarity 0.04 to 0.09). Mean seedling density was best predicted by a combination of soil wilting point, altitude and plant litter. In some cases, seedling density was greater than 80 seedlings m-2.
The relative importance of either negative (competitive) or positive (facilitative) interactions between seedlings with adjacent vegetation were investigated in relation to seed germination, seedling growth and seedling survival. Facilitative interactions were common at the higher altitude sites. At lower altitudes, facilitative and competitive interactions were common. Without close neighbours at high altitudes, seedlings were unlikely to survive into their second year.
An understanding of plant recruitment can provide a useful basis for predicting species responses to large-scale disturbance and climate change.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Seedling recruitment</field><field name="subject">Seed germination</field><field name="subject">Alpine</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Stress gradients</field><field name="subject">Competition</field><field name="subject">Facilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20080526.160815</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resolving the culture conundrum: 
A conceptual framework for the management 
of culture in TESOL</field><field name="creator">Williams, Alan Brunton</field><field name="description">The thesis explores the place of culture in the teaching of English to speakers of other languages (TESOL). The study originally set out to investigate the ways in which teachers understand culture and deal with it in their teaching of English. A survey of teachers found that while the teachers had sophisticated understandings about culture and its relationship with language at a general level, they did not have clear understandings about how cultural teaching can be enacted in the classroom. This conundrum was also evident in the literature on teaching culture in TESOL. An extensive survey of the literature found that while there are a number of different perspectives on how culture can be understood and dealt with in TESOL, none of these provide a comprehensive basis for the understandings teachers need for the practicalities of teaching. The focus of the study shifted from an investigation of professional development to the articulation of a conceptual framework to inform teachers in the way they can manage the teaching of culture. The framework draws on some significant insights of one of the perspectives in the literature, Intercultural Language Teaching, as well as some insights from other perspectives. The framework identifies dimensions in which teachers need to understand how culture can be manifest and managed in TESOL. For each dimension a number of factors on which decisions need to be made are identified. The framework also identifies a number of principles to guide teachers in their decision-making about the teaching culture. The potential of the framework to inform the teaching of English to adult immigrants in Australia, as well as students studying English in a university in Vietnam is explored. The capacity of the framework to inform TESOL teacher education, research and theory building is also evaluated.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Culture in language teaching</field><field name="subject">culture in language curriculum</field><field name="subject">intercultural education</field><field name="subject">English language teachers  Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Applied linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20060714.142623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">R. H. Bland and the Port Phillip and Colonial Gold Mining Company</field><field name="creator">Woodland, John George</field><field name="description">There are numerous histories of the Victorian goldfields, individual digger&#65533;s experiences, and the digging community as a whole. By contrast, very little has been written about the early gold mining companies. This thesis seeks to address this dearth in part, with a longitudinal study of one of the leading gold mining companies in nineteenth-century Victoria. The Port Phillip and Colonial Gold Mining Company (&#65533;Port Phillip Company&#65533;) was one of many &#65533;gold bubble&#65533; companies formed in England during 1851-3 to undertake gold mining in Australia. Within a few years it was the only survivor of this episode of British corporate gold-fever. The thesis argues that the influence of Rivett Henry Bland, the company&#65533;s managing director, was instrumental in its success, particularly in its early years when faced with anti-company sentiment and unfavourable mining legislation. The company established a large-scale operation at Clunes in 1857, rapidly assuming a pre-eminent position in colonial gold mining with its superior technology and mining practices. Historians generally portray Australian gold mining operations as small, locally funded and inefficient, prior to British capital investment in the late 1880s. While true of the larger picture, this simply emphasises the uniqueness of the British-owned and funded Port Phillip Company, the largest and most efficient gold mining operation in Australia from 1857 until the early 1880s. The company and its investment offshoot, the Victoria (London) Mining Company, invested in over thirty Victorian gold mining companies during the 1860s. Again, this runs counter to the general view that British investment in Australian gold mining began only in the late 1880s. Although the two companies&#65533; investments equalled only a fraction of the later wave of British capital in absolute monetary terms, their contribution to the growth of the Victorian gold mining industry at the time was significant.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Port Phillip and colonial Gold Mining Company</field><field name="subject">Gold mines</field><field name="subject">Mining</field><field name="subject">Victoria - 19th century</field><field name="subject">Gold miners</field><field name="subject">Port Phillip district</field><field name="subject">Clunes</field><field name="subject">Metallurgy</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20041222.162756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Priorities and Strategies for Health Information System Development in China - How Provincial Health Inforamtion Systems Support Regional Health Planning</field><field name="creator">Yang, Hui</field><field name="description">China is moving towards a market economy. The greater use of market forces has made China richer, accelerated modernisation and increased productive efficiency but has created new problems, including, in the health sector, problems of inequity and allocative inefficiency. From 1997, the Chinese government committed to a national policy of regional health planning (RHP), as part of a broader commitment to harmonising social and economic development. However, RHP has been slow to impact on the equity and efficiency problems in health care. 
Planning requires information; better health decision-making requires better health information. Information systems constitute a resource that is vital for the health planning and the management of the health system. Properly developed, managed and used, health information systems are a highly cost-effective resource for the nation and its regions. Bureaucratic resistance, one of critical reasons is that regional health planners gained insufficient support from information system. Health information needs to adopt into the new way of government health management. 
The objective of the study is to contribute to the development of China&#65533;s health information system (HIS) over the next 5-10 years, in particular to suggest how provincial health information systems could be made more useful as a basis for RHP. The existing HIS is examined in relation to its support for and relevance to RHP, including policy framework, institutional structures and resources, networks and relationships, data collection, analysis, quality and accessibility of information as well as the use of information in support of health planning. Data sources include key informant interviews, a questionnaire survey and various policy documents. Qualitative (questionnaire survey on provincial HIS) and quantitative (key informant interviews) approaches are used in this study. Document analysis is also conducted.
The research examines information for planning within the macro and historical context of health planning in China, in particular having regard to the impacts and implications of the transition to a market economy. It is evident that the implementation of RHP has been retarded by poor performance of information system, particularly at the provincial level. However, the implementation of RHP has also been complicated by fragmented administrative hierarchies, weak implementation mechanisms and contradictions between different policies, for example, between improved planning and the encouragement of market forces in health care. 
To support RHP which is needs based, has a focus on improving allocative efficiency and is adapted to the new market development will require new information products and supports including infrastructure reform and capacity development. Provincial HIS needs to move from being data generators and transmitters to becoming information producers and providers. Health planning has moved to greater use of population-based benchmark and demand-side control. Therefore, information products should be widened from supply side data collection (in particular assets and resources) to include demand-side collection and analysis (including utilisation patterns and community surveys of opinion and experience). The interaction between users (the planners) and producers (the HIS) should be strengthened and regional networks of information producers and planners should be established.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health information system</field><field name="subject">regional health planning</field><field name="subject">china</field><field name="subject">provincial</field><field name="subject">reform</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20050818.135812</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Governing the healthcare market: Regulatory challenges and options in the transitional China.</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Hongwen</field><field name="description">During the transition from a planned economy to a decentralized, market socialist economy, the Chinese healthcare system has evolved from a centralized, egalitarian public system (1949-1979) to one which is largely self-governed and can be characterized as &#65533;public identity, private behavior&#65533; healthcare system (1980-1999). With blurring of the distinction between public and private governing systems, and a shift in norms towards profit orientation, major concern has arisen about the extent of high cost, high volume services being offered through excessive entrepreneurial practices.
  This thesis is concerned with the regulatory strategies and options to reach 2010 health reform objectives of equity and efficiency under a mixed public/private market. While possible lessons can be drawn from established economies and transitional economies, China faces some unique challenges, given the diverse market structures and fragmented healthcare system across the country, and the underdeveloped framework for the rule of law.  The thesis reviews policy documents from 1949 to 2004 and draws from interviews with senior health policy-makers and hospital directors in three different locations, in order to explore the role of the state in market regulation, the effectiveness of technical and social regulations,   and how policy implementation and regulatory compliance occur.
The research has found that the dynamics of the healthcare system are shaped by the financing arrangements for healthcare and the absence of arms-length governance of hospitals by health departments. Without an effective state health financing tool, nor mature market institutions, China is not able to use neither performance-based regulation nor technology-based regulation. China has adopted a management-based regulatory strategy but the absence of effective governance structure hinders effective regulation.
If the reform objectives of improving healthcare quality while costs are to be attained, China will need to develop purchasing tools to alter the current perverse incentives for provider behavior. Government will also need to work with civil society organizations to develop tools for clinical governance, such as clinical audit for risk management and hospital accreditation programs. To do so requires establishing arms-length governance mechanisms between health departments and hospitals, and appropriate corporate governance structures within hospitals. Specifically, MOH needs to establish a technical policy think tank to investigate all the policy issues arising from the announcement of the 1997 health reform, including coordination with other line ministries and provincial authorities, and formulation and implementation of a policy research agenda, in order to attain a market-based governance system for health by 2010.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Governance</field><field name="subject">Market</field><field name="subject">Healthcare system</field><field name="subject">Hospital</field><field name="subject">Regulation</field><field name="subject">Reform</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20080131.100619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Student perspectives on school camps : a photo-elicitation interview study</field><field name="creator">Smith, Erin F.</field><field name="description">First-hand narrative accounts of participants&#8217; experiences during outdoor programmes are notably absent from the outdoor education literature. This thesis reports on an exploratory study which applied a creative qualitative approach called photo-elicitation interviews to gather student accounts about the ways in which they experienced an outdoor education programme known as &#8216;school camp&#8217;. A group of Year 10 (14-15 years old) students attending secondary school in Christchurch, New Zealand, participated in this study, and were provided with 27-exposure, disposable cameras on which they were asked to take a series of photographs to demonstrate what a residential school camp was like for them. Follow-up, individual photo-elicitation interviews with the 32 self-selected respondents (21 female, 11 male), revealed that school camp is primarily an enjoyable, social experience where students are able to spend time with their friends and develop their peer networks in a unique environment. From the perspective of these students, school camp primarily contributed to developing a greater understanding of others, while developing greater understandings of the self and the environment were less salient. A greater understanding of others was achieved primarily through the ways in which school camp created an enjoyable, novel, experience which allowed students to see their peers from a different, more &#8216;real&#8217; perspective. Aspects of this novel experience which contributed to students&#8217; social interactions included the residential nature of these camps and the absence of &#8216;urban&#8217; features associated with teenage culture such as mobile phones, clothing and make-up. Interestingly, students&#8217; camp experiences included little specific reference to the natural environment; a finding which challenges recent discourses advocating for a shift towards a more critical outdoor education aiming to promote human-nature relationships.  The use of photo-elicitation interviews in this context is critically examined. Providing students with cameras was an effective way to engage young people in academic research and to capture important aspects of the outdoor experience from their perspective. To better assess the utility of the technique, it warrants further application in other outdoor education contexts. The inclusion of participant-generated photographs, however, raises several research ethics issues. This study contributes to the growing body of qualitative literature seeking to provide a more in-depth understanding of outdoor education and complements the quantitative studies which predominate in the field.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">outdoor education</field><field name="subject">photo-elicitation interviews</field><field name="subject">school camps</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">student perspectives</field><field name="subject">student experience</field><field name="subject">residential outdoor programmes</field><field name="subject">social interaction</field><field name="subject">greater understanding of self</field><field name="subject">greater understanding of others</field><field name="subject">greater understanding of the environment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managerialism as a professionalising catalyst for the front-line practitioner community of New Zealand's Department of Conservation</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Euan S.</field><field name="description">Since 1984, public service occupations in New Zealand have been subordinated to the over-determined bureaucratic structures of contemporary managerialism. The reactions of front-line public servants to New Management&#8217;s unfamiliar &#8216;market-place&#8217; imperatives and the concomitant loss of occupational autonomy have received very little rigorous qualitative analysis. This study addresses that shortfall, taking as its cue a key question in the sociology of &#8216;profession&#8217;&#8212;what arouses or subdues the inclination of bureaucratised occupations to professionalise as a means of reclaiming autonomy? It explains the nature and meaning of strategies adopted by front-line practitioners in New Zealand&#8217;s Department of Conservation (DOC) to defend their marginalised work conventions and collegial culture. Symbolic interactionist analysis shows that profoundly personal values and beliefs connect vocationally motivated practitioners with their &#8216;mission&#8217; (to conserve natural and cultural heritage). These powerful intuitive connections play a crucial role in subduing interest in resistance and organised strategic action, principally by converting conservation labour into the pursuit of personal fulfilment. Practitioners respond to managerial intrusions on their core work (the source of their fulfilment) by defending these personal connections rather than group interests. As a result of this introversion, perceptions of &#8216;community&#8217; and occupational identity are disorganised and become a further reason for inaction. Practitioners resolve the conflict between self-interested pursuit of fulfilment and the altruistic goals of conservation by negotiating an unspoken bargain with DOC&#8217;s authority structures. The &#8216;pay-offs&#8217; for deferral to managerial authority win the space to pursue fulfilment through immersion and conspicuous achievement in work, obviating the need for more concerted defensive action. Accordingly, managerialism has not acted as a professionalising catalyst for this group.

H.</field><field name="description">Cities are not merely inanimate objects. They are complex living environments, built over time by cultures and civilisations. This thesis argues that cities have a central place in human history and civilisation because they are imbued with meaning and meaningful activity. Thus, cities are inherently political spaces, and it may be reasonably expected that they will be important sites of social transformation in the postmodern era. In order to understand the relationship between urban space and political consciousness, this thesis traces several different interpretive paths within the marxist tradition. First, we examine the work of Henri Lefebvre, who argues for an understanding of urban space as socially produced. Next, the thesis looks at the contributions of Guy Debord, particularly at his understanding of the relation between time and the city. Both writers struggle to understand the urban in the context of the shift to what we now call postmodernity. Despite their many strengths, Debord and Lefebvre ultimately fail to theorise a social subject capable of resisting capitalist domination of the city. As a result, the thesis turns to a consideration of the work of Antonio Negri. Negri&#8217;s analysis of the fate of contemporary subjectivity has reinvigorated marxist critique with a return to the question of political change. His figure of the multitude takes leave of traditional marxism in challenging and productive ways, and helps us better understand the nature of subjectivity and resistance in a world of immaterial labour and virtuality. Nevertheless, this thesis argues that there is still work to be done before Negri&#8217;s work can be mapped out onto the contemporary metropolis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urban space</field><field name="subject">political socialisation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building::310100 Architecture and Urban Environment::310199 Architecture and urban environment not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/923</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utilization of sweet potato starch, flour and fibre in bread and biscuits : physico-chemical and nutritional characteristics : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Food Technology, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Mais, Anton</field><field name="description">Sweet-potato contains a limited amount of protein, although rich in dietary fibre content and carbohydrate, so a successful combination with wheat flour for bread and biscuit production would be nutritionally advantageous. In particular, the role of these ingredients in relating to acceptability of breads and biscuit with higher percentage of sweet potato starch, flour in wheat flour. In this study, starch, flour and residue fibre of three sweet-potato varieties (red, orange and white -types) were studied. The 5 -10% combination levels for biscuit-making were found to be acceptable, without affecting the quality of the biscuit (combination of texture and biscuit size). In bread, bread containing 15% red and white replacement starches and orange replacement flour was found to be acceptable level, without affecting the quality of the bread, in an attempt to replace wheat at higher per cent level. The physicochemical study was complemented with a nutritional study to determine beneficial effects of food rich in dietary fibre and starches, in the context of improving diet related problems. RVA results showed sweet-potato ingredients affected differently the pasting temperature, peak viscosity and final viscosity of the normal wheat flour (p&lt;0.05). Fibre inclusion showed large reduction in viscosity and swelling of sweet potato starch. Biscuits and breads containing sweet-potato starch and flour are low in amylose, and digest slowly because of lowly oriented and &#8216;crystalline&#8217; areas within the granules enable to swell or to ungelatinised starch granules, whereas wheat control biscuit was able to gelatinised starch and exerted a greater effect upon digestibility. There are many other factors that need to be considered when analysing the in vitro starch digestibility such including amylose content, amylopectin structure and presence of fibre and gelatinising. Sweet-potato starch, flour and fibre addition show least effect on bread texture and size and starch, flour and fibre replacement. However, in in vitro starch digestibility test higher values RSS was recorded for starch addition followed by flour addition.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nutritional study</field><field name="subject">dietary fibre</field><field name="subject">digestibility</field><field name="subject">amylose</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290102 Food engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/921</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living free radical and photo initiation studies of acrylate, methacrylate and itaconate polymerization systems</field><field name="creator">Szablan, Zachary Peter, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis work has focused on the study of itaconate monomers and photo-initiation processes in acrylate, methacrylate and itaconate monomer systems. Novel information pertaining to photo-initiator derived radical species and their reactivity, as well as the behaviour of itaconate polymerization systems is presented in detail. The knowledge gained from the photo-initiation studies is utilized as a precursor to mark polymer chains using nitrones as radical spin traps and the applicability of this technique discussed. The sterically hindered monomers dimethyl itaconate (DMI), di-n-butyl itaconate (DBI) and dicyclohexyl itaconate (DCHI) were polymerized via reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) free radical polymerization. The RAFT mediated polymerization of these monomers displayed hybrid living behaviour (a mix of conventional and living free radical polymerization characteristics) of varying degrees depending on the molecular structure of the RAFT agent employed. DCHI was also polymerized using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The resulting molecular weight distributions are broad for the RAFT mediated systems (1.2 &#8804; PDI &#8804; 3.4). The molecular weight distributions generated via the ATRP of DCHI are narrower (1.2 &#8804; PDI &#8804; 1.5). Chain transfer to monomer constants for the itaconate monomers DMI, DBI and DCHI have been determined at 60 ??C (CDMI = 1.4&#8901;10-3, CDBI = 1.3&#8901;10-3 and CDCHI = 1.0&#8901;10-3) and are relatively large in comparison to similar 1,1-disubstituted systems, suggesting that the transfer to monomer reaction is significant. PREDICI?? simulations confirm that a significant chain transfer to monomer step results in broad molecular weight distributions. Viscosity of the polymerizing system has also been shown to be an important factor in the resulting width of the molecular weight distributions. Chain extension of RAFT capped pDCHI and pDBI yield molecular weight distributions that progressively shift to higher molecular weights. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of pDCHI-block-pStyrene copolymers indicates thermal degradation in two separate steps for the pDCHI and pStyrene blocks.     Conventional pulsed laser polymerization coupled with size exclusion chromatography (PLP-SEC) as well as multi-pulse pulsed laser polymerization (MP-PLP) has been employed to study the depropagation kinetics of DMI, DBI DCHI and di(4-tert butylcyclohexyl) itaconate (DBCHI). The effective rate coefficient of propagation, kp eff, was determined for DMI, DBI and DCHI in bulk and solution of cyclohexanone (DCHI), N-methylformamide (DMI and DBI) and anisole (DBCHI) for monomer concentrations between 0.7 &amp;lt cM 0 &amp;lt 7.1 mol L-1 in a wide temperature range (0 &amp;lt T &amp;lt 90 ??C). The resulting Arrhenius plots (i.e. ln kp eff vs. 1/RT) displayed a significant curvature in the higher temperature regimes and were analyzed in their respective linear and curved sections to yield the activation parameters of the forward and reverse reaction. Mark-Houwink-Kahn Sakurada parameters for pDBI and pDBCHI were determined in tetrahydrofuran at 40 ??C using triple detection gel permeatation chromatography. High resolution Electrospray Ionization - Quadrupole Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry (ESIMS) was applied to study the polymeric product spectrum generated by the pulsed laser polymerization (PLP) of methyl methacrylate (MMA), methyl acrylate (MA), butyl acrylate (BA) and DMI at temperatures &#8804; 0 ??C in the presence of various photo-initiators including 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (DMPA), benzoin, benzil, benzoin ethyl ether (BEE) 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) and bis(2,4,6-trimethyl-benzoyl)- phenylphosphinoxide (Irgacure 819) to study the reactivity of primary and potential secondary derived radical fragments from photolytically induced fragmentation. Termination products, both combination and disproportionation, were identified with high accuracy. Results have been compiled in a user friendly table presenting the reactivity of the various photolysis product fragments towards the different monomers. Energy deposition into the MA/photo-initiator systems is found to have no influence on the product distributions of the MA polymers produced via photo-initiation under the conditions examined. For various photo-initiators employed, products congruent to that of chain transfer to monomer species in the DMI photo-polymerizations are observed, conclusively illustrating that chain transfer to monomer is a significant reaction pathway in itaconate    free radical polymerizations. Both the benzoyl and acetal fragments generated as a result of DMPA photo cleavage were found to initiate and highly likely terminate polymerization. Under the conditions studied, the acetal radical produced upon DMPA photolysis fragment further to yield methyl radicals which seem to act predominantly as terminating moieties. Both the benzoyl and ether fragments produced as a result of benzoin photo cleavage were found to act as initiating and probable terminating species, indicating that the ether radical fragment does not act exclusively as a terminating species. Additionally, increasing laser intensity and/or irradiation repetition rate (i.e., energy deposition into the system) results in more complex product distributions of the MMA polymers produced via photo-initiation (with the exception of AIBN). Temperature was determined to have a minor influence on the resulting product distribution under the conditions examined. Polymerization systems utilizing Irgacure 819 give complex product spectra due to the formation of second generation radical species resulting in several initiator fragments incorporated into a single polymer chain. A novel method utilizing PLP in free radical polymerization has been developed for marking of polymer chains with radical spin traps. By introducing a so-called &#147;marker&#148; (nitroxide derived from a nitrone), which specifically terminates propagating radicals via combination, a polymer subdistribution is generated which can be measured by ESI-MS and may potentially be utilized to determine propagation rate coefficients of ultimate accuracy. The general methodology of the technique in which such marker radicals are generated via reaction of an initiating radical with a nitrone is demonstrated on the examples of butyl acrylate (BA) and vinyl acetate (VAc).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The magic of the city: representing places of the dead in the contemporary Western metropolis</field><field name="creator">Trigg, Rachel Helen, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis posits that throughout history, the Western city has been made and understood according to a shared image of the cosmos. It argues that though the contours of this cosmos have changed over time and place, collectively held understandings of the city endure to the present day. Drawing on literary and cultural theory, this way of understanding the city may be conceptualised as ??magical??, that is incorporating knowledge which is hermeneutic and mythical, as well as empirical.  The specific example of places of the dead, understood as cemeteries, memorials and other locations at which the dead are actually or symbolically interred, is used in this thesis to test the notion that that the city may continue to be understood as a reflection of world view. Places of the dead provide an appropriate test case for this task, as their forms and locations have clear associations with temporally and culturally specific understandings of the city. This thesis applies textual analysis and discourse analysis to seven case studies of contemporary places of the dead in order to examine the way in which the magic of the city may operate in one typology of place. It considers the representation of these case studies in a large array of texts, with particular emphasis on fictional, and thus potentially ??magical??, texts such as novels, television series and architectural drawings, as well as postcards, movies, cartoons, photographs, songs and paintings.  The results of the case studies are used to argue not only that the city continues to be understood using a wide variety of ways of knowing, but also that these alternative epistemologies offer insights into contemporary cities which are not gained through the use of conventional methodologies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Western city</field><field name="subject">Cemeteries</field><field name="subject">Memorials</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Binary skeletal copper-cobalt catalysts</field><field name="creator">Numprasanthai, Apisit, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Binary skeletal metal catalysts were made by starting with a ternary alloy. The percursor alloys and catalysts were characterised using Optical Microscopy, X-ray Diffractometer, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) and BET surface area in term of morphologies, phase identification, surface area and pore structure.  Skeletal copper catalyst presented high surface areas and consisted primarily of CuAl2 grains, with small well-dispersed areas of the Al-CuAl2 eutectic. The CuAl2 phase, which represented a tetragonal structure, showed large cell volumes resulted in a fine skeleton structure. Binary nickel-copper catalyst composed of three majority phases including Ni2Al3, Cu4NiAl7 and Al. The Cu4NiAl7 was found to be a caustic resistant phase which led to low surface area in the nickel-copper catalyst In terms of the selective removal of aluminium from the copper-cobalt-aluminium alloy to create the binary copper-cobalt catalyst, 11 alloy samples with various compositions were produced following the ternary phase diagram. The surface area and pore size of these catalysts was dependant on the crystal structure of the phases present and the amount of remaining Al. Electrochemical glucose oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction activity have been used for testing the catalyst performance.  The electrochemical oxidation of glucose experiment using 11 samples of skeletal Cu-Co catalyst as an electrode showed the results that the significant oxidation peaks were observed in sample 1, 4, 8, 9 and the small oxidation humps were observed in other sample except sample 2. These small peaks resulted from that the glucose molecule had difficulty to absorb on the surface area of the skeletal Cu-Co catalysts electrode. The difficulty may results from very fine pore volume and pore size of the catalysts. In term of assessing the skeletal Cu-Co catalyst with electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide experiment, the skeletal Cu-Co catalyst sample 7 which presented the highest surface area was selected as an electrode to compare with Cu foil electrode. The result of using skeletal Cu-Co as an electrode indicated significantly higher current. This results from that a skeletal Cu-Co catalyst electrode presented an actual high surface area which leads to more adsorbed regions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of trade liberalisation on growth, poverty and income distribution: a dynamic computable general equilibrium analysis with an application to Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Wong, Melissa Oi Ming, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In recent decades, there have been an increasingly large number of developing countries that have embraced external economic liberalisation policies. Following trade theory, trade liberalisation has the potential to increase employment elasticity of economic growth and hence, have a greater poverty reduction impact, compared to import-substitution or closed economies. However, critics of globalisation often emphasise that the benefits from growth may not be evenly spread; hence, the distributional impacts may have an adverse effect on the poor. Vietnam has undertaken major market-based reforms to transform itself into an outward-oriented economy. The resulting effects show that not only has Vietnam achieved significant growth, but it has also managed to satisfy all the Millennium Development Goals. However, a significant element of Vietnam&#146;s reforms involves integrating the Vietnamese economy with world markets through trade liberalisation policies, which may affect the welfare and distributional impacts on Vietnamese households. This dissertation examines the impact of trade liberalisation on growth, poverty and inequality for Vietnam. It develops a macro-micro analytical framework whereby a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is linked to a representative household model in order to capture these effects. The findings indicate that trade liberalisation will cause a significant increase in economic growth. The smallest gains occur under Vietnam&#146;s unilateral trade liberalisation against ASEAN while the largest gains take place when Vietnam extends its liberalisation with the rest of the world. There will be a shift away from primary sectors towards industry-based sectors such as low-tech, intermediate manufacturing and durables. There is also substantial up-skilling of unskilled labour. Combined with the large real returns to capital goods, this will result in significant increases in both capital investments as well as in the accumulation of human capital. In addition, economic growth will induce a fall in poverty rates in Vietnam. Nonetheless, there will also be large increases in the inequality of income, especially in the rural sector. Hence, although growth has lifted a large proportion of households out of poverty, the distributional impacts have been detrimental to the most vulnerable households.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Poverty</field><field name="subject">Trade liberalisation</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Income inequality</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation to improve the effectiveness of Vietnamese language learning in New South Wales primary schools</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Van Bon</field><field name="description">This study examines Vietnamese language learning in New South Wales primary schools.

Called hegemonic or patriachal masculinity, it is seen as a form of masculinity with personal and social dimensions. In similar fashion, popular writings identify the traditional male heroic image as the cultural model of masculinity. This study explores the impact of such a dominant model of masculinity as factors in how boys and young males learn to be a man. The research looks at the lives of 13 males aged in their early 20s and around 40 years of age, utilising life-course theory and a social-psychological perspective. It compares and contrasts the experiences and perceptions of these young and mid-life males, with regard to the dominant social model of masculinity. The study seeks to assess the significance of the dominant cultural model of masculinity, as a model for what it means to be a man, for males at different stages of their life course. The dominant model of masculinity appears as a rather one dimensional model, a mainly tough, brave and physical image. During adolescence popular culture was the major influence upon their ideas and perceptions of masculinity. This influence came via their interest and participation in sport, the masculine cultural ideal enforced by their peers, and popular media images. the traditional model of masculinity can be seen to be a heroic form of masculinity with emphasis upon power, competition, success and glory. Traditional or patriarchal masculinity, called more simply heroic masculinity, emerges as a potent influence for both the young and mid-life males in terms of values, behaviours and practice. Traditional masculinity emerges as an influence they barely recognise; and possibly a factor in the limited emotional repertoire and guardedness that mid-life males exhibit.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dominant</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">male heroic image</field><field name="subject">media images</field><field name="subject">masculine cultural ideal</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The female metaphor - virgin, mother, crone - of the dynamic cosmological unfolding : her embodiment in seasonal ritual as a catalyst for personal and cultural change</field><field name="creator">Livingstone, Glenys D.</field><field name="description">This research is a study of the Female Metaphor in her three aspects of Virgin, Mother and Crone. It is an interpretation of these three faces as representing the Dynamic by which the Cosmos unfolds, that is, the extant Creativity that is in continual transformation and has always been so. Accordingly, as this thesis takes the Cosmos to be a seamless whole, the conscious alignment with the continual process of transformation innate to Being. Thomas Berry and Brian Swimme call the composition of these three, cosmic grammar. The ritual celebration of seasonal points are then developed as a method of embodying and sensualizing, and speaking this deep Dynamic of Creativity. These ritual celebrations are based in ancient Western spiritual practice that relates with Earth's cyclical transitions. Through methods of ritual, meditation, imagination, dance and storytelling, over the period of the annual seasonal cycle, I created a context, which sought to enable more harmonious relationship with self, other and Cosmos through identification of the self with an organic and primordial process innate to the unfolding Cosmos. I found it to be a process that catalyzed personal transformation of the participants over time - a transformation that has clear and inevitable cultural implications. While it is not the focus of this thesis to track these cultural changes, such change is implicit in the personal and relational changes experienced and noted, since the personal and the cultural are mutually embedded in a shamanic process like this is.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feminist spirituality</field><field name="subject">shamanism</field><field name="subject">cosmos</field><field name="subject">seasonal cycles</field><field name="subject">personal transformation</field><field name="subject">ritual</field><field name="subject">primordial</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In and out of play : negotiated activity in preadolescent girls' talk</field><field name="creator">Ardington, Angela Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how playful language functions in the friendship talk of preadolescent girls.By experimentation and manipulation of language, speakers negotiate turbulence to accomplish a variety of actions which highlight the talk-as-play function.The analytical focus is on speaker's negotation of talk in and out of play and non play.

Gender construction is examined by observing and analysing the literacy interactions of six kindergarten children (three boys and three girls) at school and in the home. The analysis shows the ways in which the girls and boys differ in attaining literacy skills, and also reveals the different interactions between the children and their families. The ways literacy is perceived in the home are also noted. The children responded in a much more uniform way in the classroom than they did in their individual home situations. The findings are significant for educational practice because they provide insight into how implicit structuring by teachers can affect the extent of participation of boys and girls in the classroom. The results indicate how analysis in the emergent state of literacy development is critical for a thorough understanding of gender construction.

Comprehensive geochemical modelling based on equilibrium processes was undertaken to elucidate the geochemical conditions under which the various assemblages formed. The exercise was extended in a series of experiments concerning the interaction of ground and vadose waters with secondary mineral species. This has led to a self-consistent geochemical exploration model for deposits in the Cobar basin.

It specifically examines the contribution to Holocaust denial of Irving's ideological beliefs as expounded in his published works and his many public speeches. My thesis also presents evidence and an argument about Irving's crusade to promote Holocaust denial. This thesis will chart a changing consciousness about the established history of the Holocaust, in which conventional historical discussion is gradually losing ground. Deborah Lipstadt argues that these attacks on history and knowledge have the potential to alter the way established truth is transmitted from generation to generation. Lipstadt points out that according to some post-structuralist scholars no fact, no event, and no aspect of history any longer has any fixed meaning or content. Any truth can be retold. Any fact can be re-cast. Lipstadt defines this as bigotry. I tend to agree. This thesis will examine the genesis and context of holocaust denial. Here I shall evaluate significant contemporary denial writings and offer some perspectives about the controversy; I will consider general aspects of David Irving's background, personality and the major steps in his intellectual development; Irving will be examined as an author of historical books and an historian of the Second World War; examine Irving as a Holocaust denier; examine both Irving's political agenda, his propensity to associate with extreme right groups and individual and his alleged capacity to incite violence.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Holocaust</field><field name="subject">David Irving</field><field name="subject">Second World War</field><field name="subject">World War II</field><field name="subject">Lipstadt</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building the bridges: the transition to school for children with special needs and their families</field><field name="creator">Newman, Linda</field><field name="description">The process of transition to school for children with special needs is a complex one. There is a range of stakeholders involved in the process - the child, their family and a range of professionals. The process involves a change from one set of service providers to another, and may include shifts in philosophies, models of service delivery and qualifications and practices of staff. If the process is to be effective and efficient continuity is essential, including continuity between services the child is leaving and the school; of teaching and learning; of relationships with families; and of planning and management of the transition process. During the transition process the attitudes and views of families and professionals are enmeshed within a framework of policies, management procedures and the decision making required within each. This thesis includes an outline of best practice and investigates the issue of continuity during the transition from early intervention services to school. Research was carried out in Western Sydney with a group of early childhood teachers who described their current beliefs and practices related to transition.

The study was conducted in a rural school following trials in other sites. Conversational interviews were conducted and from the transcript sixteen core categories of beliefs across all participant groups were identified. The belief statements demonstrate the complex nature of the social, cultural, economic, historical and political contexts in which the learning of mathematics takes place. A number of actions intended to enhance Aboriginal children's learning of mathematics are proposed. Non-Aboriginal teachers need to share their beliefs with the Aboriginal community, and conversations need to occur between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people about mathematics education. Teachers require pedagogical strategies that address Aboriginal children's learning of mathematics, and educational systems need to include an Aboriginal perspective in mathematics curricula.

Isolation may be a result of a change in environment, such as an interstate move to take up a new job,or changing from an office environment to home based work. It can result from relational changes such as marriage breakdown or from major life stage changes such as retirement. The first stage of the study involved the establishment of a collaborative group to explore issues that each member had experienced in coping with change. The second stage was an individual exploration of the author's own journey involving changes in work environments and interstate moves. The third stage was a consideration of literature that reflected and supported the thesis, of gathering information from relevant case studies conducted.Out of these stages came the hypothesis that people cope with change in isolation through a sense of belonging associated with several factors.Reflections on the research process and methodologies have been considered and implications arising out of the research are discussed.

The study concentrates on Africa and argues that development strategies are dependent on a clear understanding of the contexts and constraints of a situation. It is argued that Africa's history and present political and socio-economic situations have contributed to the instability and poverty facing many of its nation states. It is also argued that continued dependency by African nations on richer Western nations is a problem originating from colonial imperialism and the failed dominant paradigm, recently reinvented as globalisation and global economic rationalisation. The work presents a view of communication for development which can only be achieved with an understanding of the relations between media, culture, dependency and the making of meaning.Solutions to Africa's problems may require Africans themselves undertaking development in a concept of their own 'voice' and self-representation. With this view, a model for how journalists, using media, should actively engage in development is suggested. Two case studies are presented : a study of communication dysfunction at Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya and a study of the concept of Edutainment by South Africa's Soul City's organisation.

Among the many reasons proposed to explain the persistent school underachievement is that school culture is largely based on individualism, interpersonal competition, and other Western norms and values. These, it is argued, are an anathema to Native Americans. Hence, school culture may predispose many Navajo High School students to failure. To test this belief I constructed a model of school achievement motivation drawn from Western conceptualizations of achievement motivation described Navajo High School students achievement motivation. Using confirmatory factor analyses tests of equivalency were conducted that contrasted non-traditional Navajo students and females with near traditional Navajo students and males. Using structural equation modeling, I examined the relations of the language, location, and gender variables on the achievement goal factors, mediated by school measures of achievement, ability beliefs, social goals and achievement goals. I concluded that non-traditional and near traditional Navajo students are more similar than dissimilar. Clearly this raises concerns regarding the making of policy based on assumptions regarding presumed differences between non-traditional and near traditional Navajo High School students. I also concluded that, school achievement measures, the ability beliefs, and the social approval and social concern goals are important factors that influence the school achievement goals Navajo students emphasize.

The big fish little pond effect (BFLPE) predicts that students with mild intellectual disability will have higher academic self-concepts when in a special class, whereas labeling theory predicts that placing these students in special classes will lower their self-concepts. This study addresses some of these issues by: identifying a psychometrically sound, multidimensional self-concept measurement instrument; critically examining the structure and nature of self-concepts; investigating the effects of regular and special class placement upon students&#8217; self-concepts, social comparison processes, academic achievement, and stigmatisation; and evaluating the legitimacy of the BFLPE and labeling theory. Three studies were conducted on 211 students in years 2-6. The first study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Self Description Questionnaire I Individual Administration (SDQI-IA) and examined the structure and self-concepts of the sample, and results demonstrated that the SDQI-IA is a valid and reliable measure. The second study tested the BLFPE and labeling theory and results provided support for the BFLPE.

Although search engines can rapidly process a large number of Web documents, in many cases, the answers returned by search engines are not relevant to the user&#8217;s information need, although they do contain the same keywords as the query. This is because the Web contains information sources created by numerous authors independently, and the authors&#8217; vocabularies vary greatly. Furthermore, most words in natural languages have inherent ambiguity. This vocabulary mismatch between user queries and Web sources is often addressed through query expansion. Moreover, user questions are often short. The results of a search can be improved when the length of the question is long. Various query expansion methods that add useful question-related terms before processing the question have been proposed and proven to increase the performance of the result. Some of these query expansion methods add contextual information related to the user and the question. On the other hand, human communications are quite successful and seem to be very easy. This is mainly due to the understanding of language and the world knowledge that humans have. Human communication is more successful when there is an implicit understanding of everyday situations of others who take part in the communication. Here the implicit situational information, or the &#8220;context&#8221; that humans share, enables them to have a more meaningful interaction amongst themselves. Similar to human&#8211;human communications, improving computers&#8217; access to context can increase the richness of human&#8211;computer communications, giving more useful computational services to users. Based on the above factors, this research proposes a method to make use of context in order to understand and process user requests. Here, the term &#8220;context&#8221; means the meanings associated with key query terms and preferences that have to be decided in order to process the query. As in a natural environment, results produced to different users for the same question could vary in an automated system. If the automated system knows users&#8217; preferences related to the question, then it could make use of these preferences to process user queries, producing more relevant and useful results to the user. Hence, a new approach for a personalised query expansion is proposed in this research, where user queries are expanded with user preferences and hence the expanded queries that will be used for processing vary for different users. An architecture that is required for such a Web application to carryout a personalised query expansion with contextual information is also proposed in the thesis. The preferences that could be used for the query expansion are therefore user-specific. Users have different set of preferences depending on the tasks they want to perform. Similar tasks that have same types of preferences can be grouped into task based domains. Hence, user preferences will be the same in a domain, and will vary across domains. Furthermore, there can be different types of subtasks that could be performed within a domain. The set of preferences that could be used for each sub task could vary, and it will be a sub set of the set of preferences of the domain. Hence, an approach for a personalised query expansion which adds user, domain and task-specific preferences to user queries is proposed in this research. The main stages of this expansion are identified and discussed in this thesis. Each of these stages requires different contextual information which is represented in the context model. Out of the main stages identified in the query expansion process, the first three stages, the domain identification, task identification, and missing parameter identification, are explored in the thesis. As the preferences used for the expansion depend on the query domain, it is necessary to identify the domain of the query at first instance. Hence, a domain identification algorithm which makes use of eight different features is proposed in the thesis to identify domains of given queries. This domain identification also reduces the ambiguity of query terms. When the query domain is identified, context/associating meanings of query terms are known. This limits the scope of the possible misinterpretations of query terms. A domain ontology, domain dictionary, and user profile are used by the domain identification algorithm. The domain ontology consists of objects and their categories, attributes of objects and their categories, relationships among objects, and instances and their categories in the domain. The domain dictionary consists of objects and attributes. This is created automatically from the domain ontology. The user profile has the long term preferences of the user that are domain-specific and general. When the domain of the query is known, in order to decide the preferences of the user, the task specified in the query has to be identified. This task identification process is found to be similar in domains with similar activities. Hence, domains are grouped at this stage. These domain groups and the rules that could be used to find out the tasks in the domain groups are identified and discussed in the thesis. For each sub tasks in the domain groups, the types of preferences that could be used to expand user queries are identified and are used to expand user queries. An experiment is designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The first three stages of the query expansion, the domain identification, task identification, and missing parameter identification, are implemented and evaluated. Samples of five domains are implemented, and queries are collected in these domains from various users. In order to create new domains, a wizard is provided by the system. This system also allows editing the existing domains, domain groups, and types of preferences in sub tasks of the domain groups. Instances of the attributes are manually identified and added to the system using the interface provided by the system. In each of the stages of the query expansion, the results of the queries are manually identified, and are compared with the results produced by the system. The results have confirmed that the proposed method has a positive impact in query expansion. The experiments, results and evaluation of the proposed query expansion approach are also presented in the thesis. The proposed approach for the query expansion could be used by search engines, organisations with a limited set of task domains, and any application that can be improved by making use of personalised query expansion.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">internet searching</field><field name="subject">querying (computer science)</field><field name="subject">information storage and retrieval systems</field><field name="subject">information organization</field><field name="subject">information retrieval</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/33427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Socio-political philosophy of Vietnamese Buddhism : a case study of the Buddhist movement of 1963 and 1966</field><field name="creator">Pham, Van Minh</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the political activism of Vietnamese Engaged Buddhism in the 1960s, particularly the Struggle Movement for social justice and democracy of 1963 and the Peace Movement of 1966.

It is hoped that this study can begin to clarify such methods, and also limit potential abuses of lexical borrowing that do not accord with the linguistic principles of the Modern Chinese language. In addressing these issues this study covered eight forms of borrowing that exist in Modern Chinese borrowings.In effect these eight forms all stem from either phonetic, semantic or direct transplantation forms of borrowing.This thesis has also discussed many of the linguistic difficulties, and their resolutions, that arise in the process of borrowing.It has also highlighted several aspects of lexical borrowing that have not been addressed in previous literature, and suggested creative ways in which these issues could be addressed in the future.

The work briefly describes the evolution of the practice of this form of gambling and details the extent of the activity in the Australian nation. Note is made of the obvious limited amount of attention previously given to the topic by academia. Using illustrations of the extent of the complexity and resulting uncertainty of outcome in selecting winning horses the study finds that the consequential behaviour of almost all those who bet is the adoption of a co-ordinated process of selection commonly referred to as a system. As hypothesised the study found three major categories,viz., logical, naive and superstitious. Sub-types of the three categories, devised as a part of the study, are listed and defined. Unexpectedly the work brought to attention the finding that most bettors, even those following logical systems, will, at times, adopt superstitious practices. Examples are provided of logical, yet simple, selection systems that could be beneficially adopted by those persons who would otherwise follow naive and superstitious systems of selection.

Australian talk broadcasters are shown discursively creating a living 'thirdspace' or 'real virtuality' of transactional locations. Listener-caller participation arrays varying social orders across this imagined-yet-real terrain. Radio talk thus becomes a 'euphemised' form of social pre-dispositioning power, differentially locating power across communities. Four sets of talk-radio texts are examined in detail, using a socially contextualised form of linguistic analysis. Transcripts from 2UE's 'The Stan Zemanek Show' reveals an openly-gendered and more covertly classed discourse. The address to private rather than to public 'selves' in late-night sex-counselling talkback is examined. The study then examines programming from the community radio sector of volunteer-produced, local radio transmission. Finally, the study examines 'The prison show', a community radio music request and message programme for Aboriginal prisoners. The study concludes by suggesting that talk radio's role within cultural formation is complex in its articulations, but deeply implicated within the major cultural formational activities of contemporary consumer culture, on which are being modelled digital audio broadcasting's newly intensified flows of interactivity</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">talk shows</field><field name="subject">radio programs</field><field name="subject">language and culture</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">interactivity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Participatory action research to improve the livelihood of rural people through livestock production in South Sulawesi, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Habibie, Hasnawaty</field><field name="description">This research was conducted within the context of smallholder livestock production and government attempts to improve this through a transfer of technology approach. Participatory action research (PAR) was used to enable action for change to emerge, while the research provided understanding and a basis for this action. Tombolo village in South Sulawesi, Indonesia was the location for this research, which first identified the problems and needs of the farmers, and then participatively developed strategies to meet these needs. Fodder security throughout the year was found to be the major constraint to cattle production. Forage technology was introduced, including fodder tree legumes and grasses, resulting in improved livestock production and many associated livelihood benefits. The introduction of these new technologies was adapted by stakeholders to local issues and needs. The extension services had previously aimed to improve livestock production through breeding and veterinary health measures, and had assumed that sufficient fodder was available for livestock. The formation of a learning group of farmers, who used group discussion to set their own agenda, was employed to identify this shortcoming, and how to sustainably overcome it. Participants were able to apply their experience and enhance their cognitive skills to find new meanings and knowledge to plan and take actions to improve their practice and situation. This thesis documents the process of change required to move from a &#8220;Transfer of Technology&#8221; approach to a &#8220;learning approach&#8221;. The research has shown that there is considerable potential for the application of PAR to rural community development in Indonesia. More specifically in Tombolo village PAR enabled farmers and extension staff to be empowered by becoming active participants in the research process and take action to improve their own practice. It helped them to analyse the situation to make the technology more appropriate, while also learning how to change the extension methods used towards one in which all stakeholders became partners in developing their situation</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">livestock productivity</field><field name="subject">farmers</field><field name="subject">economic conditions</field><field name="subject">Sulawesi</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/570</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing a continuously creative organisation</field><field name="creator">Hudson, Ken</field><field name="description">This research confirms that organisational creativity is of growing interest to leaders due to an an anticipated move into the information age, and the growth of the new economy.

The metacognitive, self-regulatory learning behaviours of sixteen kindergarten students were examined in order to determine how students perceive learning, either by adopting deep approaches, where the focus is on understanding and meaning, or surface approaches, where the meeting of institutional demands frequently subjugate the former goals. The data have been analysed within a qualitative paradigm from a phenomenographic perspective. The study addresses three issues: the nature and frequency of the strategic learning behaviours displayed by the students; the contribution strategic behaviours make to the adoption of deep or surface learning approaches; and how metacognitive teaching environments influence higher-order thinking. Findings reveal that where teachers had metcognitive training, the frequency of strategy use increased irrespective of student performance. High achieving students used more strategic behaviours, used them with greater efficiency, and tended to display more of the characteristics of deep approach learners. This study suggests that many of the differential outcomes evident amongst students may be substantially reduced through early and consistent training within a teaching environment conductive to the development of metacognitive, self-regulatory behaviours and deep learning approaches</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learning behaviours</field><field name="subject">teaching environment</field><field name="subject">deep learning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Eastern affair</field><field name="creator">Justo, Nelia</field><field name="description">A continuing interest in the relationship between the 'decorative' and the 'technological' is a key area that underpins the author's artistic practice.

Many species in fire-prone locations, and most species in the Sydney region, form soil seedbanks and regenerate through post-fire germination. However, a germination response is determined by the fire regime acting as a selective pressure over a sufficient period of time, rather than a single fire. The components of the fire-regime are intensity, season, type and frequency. The natural fire regime is dominated by warm-season fire, but management burning is conducted in cooler seasons. Cool season burning produces lower levels of germination than warm season fires in a number of locations with Mediterranean-type climate, but the effects of cool season burning on species composition in the relatively aseasonal Sydney region is unknown. An experimental approach was adopted to address this lack of knowledge. Fire can be simulated using heat shock and smoke (fire cues), and the seasonal factors of temperature and water availability can be reproduced in the laboratory. I have investigated the effect of various combinations of heat shock and smoke, of various pre-and post-fire cue temperatures, of prefire cue hydration status, of various post-fire cue water availabilities, and of accelerated aging before application of fire cues on germination of a number of species forming soil seedbanks in the Sydney region. A degree of primary dormancy was overcome in most species by the combination of heat shock and smoke in the current investigation. Fire intensity is expected to influence germination, as germination of most species was increased by the combination of heat shock and smoke within a narrow heat shock range.The interaction between ambient temperature and the level of heat shock may affect germination. Soil water content, and thus seed moisture content at the time of a fire may interact with the level of heat shock to affect both germination and survival of a seed. The age of a seed may also affect its germination response to fire. The above factors are predicted to affect the germination of species differently, and thus season of fire is expected to alter species composition. Such predictions can be readily field-tested</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil seed banks</field><field name="subject">effect of fires</field><field name="subject">germination</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/697</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental attitudes : the Influence of culture</field><field name="creator">Watson, Kevin</field><field name="description">Public awareness of environmental problems and the need to work towards their solution have been heightened at international conferences for over two decades.Knowledge of the range of environmental perspectives and attitudes, and understanding the reasons for them, are important requirements for decision-making when dealing with global environmental issues.

In particular, substantial issues are investigated involving the interaction of students' academic motivation and cognition, and specifies how selected motivational and cognitive variables may influence student academic achievement. In order to do this, this study develops a causal model of student achievement which, using goal theory as a framework, incorporates both motivational and cognitive variables to account for students' academic achivement. In total, the results suggest that students' academic achievement may be both conceptualised, and operationalised, as the product of interrelations between key facilitating, motivational, and cognitive variables. Despite some limitations, the study suggests several positive directions for future research. These include, in particular, further investigation of the social goals identified, how these goals relate to students' academic cognition, and how selected social goals and strategies together influence students' academic achievement.

The main thrust of this study is to empirically examine in detail two factors which are strong contributors to school achievement. The first is the motivational goals of these students. The second is the Language proficiency of Lebanese-background students in their first language (Arabic) and their second lanaguage (English). The study involves quantitative analyses of two sets of questionnaires administered to all the Year 9 students in three South-western metropolitan Sydney high schools. The Year 10 School Certificate results of this same group of students was then used to measure their level of achievement. Four groups were established for comparison: the non-Lebanese-, English-, Chinese- and Vietnamese- background groups. This study is contextualized within a discussion of some of the family factors which contribute to the achievement of migrant children in schools. Of particular relevance to Lebanese-background students are the socio-economic and educational background of parents, and the historical and social context of the Lebanese in Australia. The thesis concludes by putting forth some recommendations which involve the collaborative efforts of the home, the school and the community, suggesting that part of the solution lies in this collaborative effort.

The operation of Ad-hoc networks depends on the cooperation among nodes to provide connectivity and communication routes. However, such an ideal situation may not always be achievable in practice. Some nodes may behave maliciously, resulting in degradation of the performance of the network or even disruption of its operation altogether. The ease of establishment, along with the mobility capabilities that these networks offer, provides many advantages. On the other hand, these very characteristics, as well as the lack of any centralised administration, are the root of several nontrivial challenges in securing such networks. One of the key objectives of this thesis is to achieve improvements in the performance of Ad-hoc networks in the presence of malicious nodes. In general, malicious nodes are considered as nodes that subvert the capability of the network to perform its expected functions. Current Ad-hoc routing protocols, such as the Ad-hoc On demand Distance Vector (AODV), have been developed without taking the effects of misbehaving nodes into consideration. In this thesis, to mitigate the effects of such nodes and to attain high levels of security and reliability, an approach that is based on the utilisation of the behaviour history of all member nodes is proposed. The aim of the proposed approach is to identify routes between the source and the destination, which enclose no, or if that is not possible, a minimal number, of malicious nodes. This is in contrast to traditional approaches that predominantly tend to use other criteria such as shortest path alone. Simulation and experimental results collected after applying the proposed approach, show significant improvements in the performance of Ad-hoc networks even in the presence of malicious nodes. However, to achieve further enhancements, this approach is expanded to incorporate trust levels between the nodes comprising the Ad-hoc network. Trust is an important concept in any relation among entities that comprise a group or network. Yet it is hard to quantify trust or define it precisely. Due to the dynamic nature of Ad-hoc networks, quantifying trust levels is an even more challenging task. This may be attributed to the fact that different numbers of factors can affect trust levels between the nodes of Ad-hoc networks. It is well established that fuzzy logic and soft computing offer excellent solutions for handling imprecision and uncertainties. This thesis expands on relevant fuzzy logic concepts to propose an approach to establish quantifiable trust levels between the nodes of Ad-hoc networks. To achieve quantification of the trust levels for nodes, information about the behaviour history of the nodes is collected. This information is then processed to assess and assign fuzzy trust levels to the nodes that make up the Ad-hoc network. These trust levels are then used in the routing decision making process. The performance of an Ad-hoc network that implements the behaviour history based approach using OPtimised NETwork (OPNET) simulator is evaluated for various topologies. The overall collected results show that the throughput, the packet loss rate, and the round trip delay are significantly improved when the behaviour history based approach is applied. Results also show further enhancements in the performance of the Ad-hoc network when the proposed fuzzy trust evaluation approach is incorporated with a slight increase in the routing traffic overhead. Given the improvements achieved when the fuzzy trust approach is utilised, for further enhancements of security and reliability of Ad-hoc networks, future work to combine this approach with other artificial intelligent approaches may prove fruitful. The learning capability of Artificial Neural Networks makes them a prime target for combination with fuzzy based systems in order to improve the proposed trust level evaluation approach.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ad hoc networks (computer networks)</field><field name="subject">computer networks</field><field name="subject">security measures</field><field name="subject">fuzzy logic</field><field name="subject">neural networks</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/19135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors Influencing Women's Selection of Infant Feeding Method</field><field name="creator">Godson, Diane</field><field name="description">Decision making could be defined as the ability to make a choice or a judgement before an individual takes action. How the individual works through the process of making a decision is influenced by a number of factors. It is acknowledged decision making is a complex process that involves cognitive and affective thought processing, together with interpretation, understanding, choosing between alternatives and taking action. The steps involved in this process are varied and range from a few to many depending on whose literature one is reading at the time. This descriptive cross sectional study aimed to determine what factors influenced a woman's decision when choosing the infant feeding method for her newborn. The information was gathered by means of a survey questionnaire and follow-up telephone interview. The factors identified as being important or influencing the decision were included on the survey. These factors were highlighted in previous studies and were considered part of the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) the framework on which this study was based. The one hundred and sixteen women who participated in this study had delivered term babies - that is babies over thirty-seven weeks gestation, in two hospitals in metropolitan Melbourne. A number of assumptions were tested. The descriptive statistics was generated using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 7. The qualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis. Eighty-five per cent (85%) of the women in this study made the decision to breastfeed and seventy-five per cent (75%) made this decision prior to their pregnancy being confirmed. Ninety-seven (83.6%) of the women stated their own values and beliefs had a major influence (i) on their infant feeding decision with just over twenty per cent (20.2%) of the women indicating the midwife had a major influence on their decision. Results of data supported or refuted the assumptions made at the beginning of the study and previous studies. These results also identified areas in midwifery practice that require change. This in itself will be a challenge for midwives. How they respond to this challenge may have an impact of the way women make the decision regarding their choice of infant feeding</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infant feeding</field><field name="subject">Newborns</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp204.15072009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Research and Evaluation of Psycho-Educational Approaches to Prevention and Intervention for Marginalised Young People in the Barwon Region of Victoria</field><field name="creator">Green, Susan Margaret</field><field name="description">This study undertook an evaluation of six alternative education programs provided by St Augustine's Education and Training in the Barwon region of Victoria. The impetus for the study has come from the staff of St Augustine's who bravely opened up their programs to closer scrutiny in order to gain a clearer understanding about the needs of the students attending their programs, the theoretical basis of their work and the outcomes of program intervention. A utilisation-focused approach was used and incorporated the following components: a needs analysis using a variety of measures to identify the characteristics of the students and to describe the experiences of students and parents, a qualitative process to articulate the model of psycho-education intervention and issues in service delivery and an impact evaluation to assess the effectiveness of intervention. There were 158 students aged between 6 and 15 years enrolled in programs over a two year period. The results of the needs analysis found that programs were appropriately targeting a marginalised and disadvantaged group of students that typically came from a low socioeconomic background, were significantly behind in their academic achievement, had poor adaptive functioning skills, exhibited a low level of social-emotional development (social-emotional competencies and negative attitudes towards learning) and a high level of psychopathology (mental health symptoms). Using the Survey of Student Assets (Bernard, 2002), the impact evaluation found that programs were successful in increasing the students' social-emotional capabilities and positive attitudes towards learning but did not impact significantly on the students' presenting mental health symptoms and adaptive functioning as measured by the Teachers Report Form (Achenbach and Rescoria, 2001). However, these results are to be interpreted with caution given the small sample sizes used in the analysis. Across the six programs it was found that a total of 89 students (56.3%) experienced a positive outcome destination immediately post-program and these students were maintained in, or transitioned back to mainstream school (n=71) or entered vocational training, education or employment (n= 18). Negative outcome destinations were experienced by 35 students (22.1 %) either because they were excluded (n=3), not engaged (n= 15) or withdrew from program (n= 17). At the end of the study, the remaining 25 students (15.8%) were either referred internally onto another program (n=16) or remained in program (n=9). In predicting outcome destinations, students with positive outcomes, were those that presented with less serious mental health symptoms, in particular they had lower rule-breaking and externalising scores on the Teachers Report Form at referral and a higher level of adaptive functioning in the area of 'working hard'. Students experiencing positive outcome destinations were also those that attended program regularly and for a fewer number of months and were involved in fewer critical incidents whilst attending. The qualitative process evaluation found that the model delivered was grounded in the principles of exemplary practice found in the psycho-educational literature and focused on building positive relationships and a sense of belonging, the provision of hands-on learning activities and rewarding individual achievement. Parents and students generally provided positive feedback however the theme analysis of staff, student and parent interviews and the case study scenarios did identify a number of critical areas to be addressed. These included clarifying the target group and the length and intensity of intervention, improving assessment, planning and transition processes, better collaboration with other services and mainstream schools, the on-site delivery of auxiliary services to meet specific student needs, work to better support and involve parents and to develop a sense of community across the school. A strategic planning process involving key stakeholders to systematically address these areas was recommended.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psycho-educational programs</field><field name="subject">Alternative education programs</field><field name="subject">Intervention</field><field name="subject">Young people</field><field name="subject">Barwon Region, Victoria</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp205.15072009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women, social capital and mental well-being: An examination of participation in community groups</field><field name="creator">Osborne, Katy</field><field name="description">This thesis examines women&#146;s participation in community groups, in order to investigate the concept of &#145;social capital&#146; and its implications for women&#146;s mental well-being. Its aim is to examine the concept of social capital, and the ways it is linked with health, in a way that is attentive to gender and class inequity. For the purposes of this thesis, social capital is broadly defined as social relationships between people and the individual or community level &#145;resources&#146; that can arise from these social relationships. Two different conceptualisations of social capital were considered in this study: the &#145;communitarian&#146; approach associated with Robert Putnam, and the more &#145;critical&#146; conceptualisation associated with Pierre Bourdieu. This research adopted a critical stance towards social capital, and focused upon four research questions: Firstly, what was the nature of participation in community groups among women who live in metropolitan Adelaide? Secondly, what were the personal outcomes that were perceived to arise from women&#146;s community group involvement? Thirdly, what were the differences in the nature and perceived outcomes of women&#146;s community group participation, according to social and economic factors? Finally, how did the nature and perceived outcomes of women&#146;s participation in community groups relate to the ways they experienced their mental health and well-being? 

This study used qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate these questions. The quantitative analysis provided a preliminary investigation to complement the qualitative study, and involved the analysis of questionnaire data from 968 women in two contrasting areas of Adelaide. This analysis considered sociodemographic differences in the type and frequency of women&#146;s involvement. The qualitative research involved the analysis of in-depth interviews with 30 women. The interviews explored the participants&#146; experiences of community group involvement; the personal outcomes that they felt arose from their involvement, their &#145;lay accounts&#146; of their mental health, and how they felt community group involvement was connected with their mental well-being. 

This study found that women&#146;s participation was shaped by gender and aspects of economic, cultural and &#145;informal&#146; social capital. The qualitative data illustrated that women&#146;s involvement was influenced, motivated and constrained by the gendered nature of their roles and responsibilities. These findings also highlighted contrasts among the participants in the types of involvement they undertook, and the personal outcomes of their involvement, according to their levels of material, financial and social advantage. This was supported by the quantitative findings, which revealed that the respondents&#146; participation in community groups, the type of group involvement they undertook, and the frequency of their involvement varied according to sociodemographic measures.

The qualitative findings also identified how community group participation could lead to both positive and negative outcomes for individual women. Many participants reported the ways in which they felt their involvement enhanced their mental well-being. The qualitative data also illustrated how involvement could detract from mental well-being. In some instances, the negative consequences of participation had a severe and detrimental impact upon mental health. The findings of this study offer support to feminist criticisms of communitarian approaches to social capital, and to Bourdieu&#146;s critical approach to understanding the concept. The study concludes that Bourdieu&#146;s conceptualisation offers greater potential for considering how community group participation and &#145;social capital&#146; can be used as a strategy to promote women&#146;s health and mental well-being.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social capital</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">mental well-being</field><field name="subject">community group participation</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090615.094909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ABORIGINAL EDUCATION WORKERS IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA: TOWARDS EQUALITY OF RECOGNITION OF INDIGENOUS ETHICS OF CARE PRACTICES</field><field name="creator">MacGill, Bindi Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis is focused on Aboriginal Education Workers (AEWs) who work with, support and care for Indigenous students in schools in South Australia.  AEWs work in the &#145;border zones&#146; (Giroux 2005) between the values of schools and the expectations of Indigenous communities.  This thesis highlights how AEWs experience indirect discrimination in the workplace as a result of their complex racialised position.  In particular, there is a general absence of recognition of AEWs&#146; caring role by non-Indigenous staff in schools.   

AEWs are not only marginalised in schools, but also at an institutional level.  While AEWs&#146; working conditions have improved, the &#145;redistribution&#146; (Fraser &amp; Honneth 2003, p. 10) of better working conditions has not eliminated indirect discrimination in the workplace.  Furthermore, there is little research regarding AEWs in Indigenous education.  Thus at three levels, namely school, Department of Education and Children&#146;s Services (DECS) and academia, there is a cyclical pattern that perpetuates an absence of recognition of AEWs.

This thesis uses whiteness theory (Frankenberg 1993) as a theoretical framework to examine this lack of recognition and the consequent low status of AEWs in schools.  The thesis emerges from research, experience working as a teacher in a remote Aboriginal school with AEWs, and in-depth semi-structured interviews with 12 AEWs who are working in South Australian state schools.  Standpoint theory (Collins 2004; Harding 2004) is used as both a method and methodology in order to understand and map AEWs&#146; position in schools.  A common theme raised by all of the AEWs in the interviews is the absence of recognition of their work in schools by non-Indigenous staff and the consequent feeling of marginalisation in the workplace.  In this thesis the site-specific contexts of the interviewees and the effects of whiteness are examined.

The findings that emerged from the in-depth semi-structured interviews with AEWs were concerned with Indigenous ethics of care models.  The narratives from the interviewees who were AEWs revealed how white ethics of care practices in schools de-legitimise Indigenous ethics of care.  Furthermore, the discursive regimes that govern school policy and protocol often limit AEWs&#146; ability to respond effectively to Indigenous student needs.  This thesis highlights the complexities and contradictions of AEWs who are working in the border zones.  As a result, AEWs often feel caught between school expectations and community protocols. 

This thesis advocates equality of recognition of Indigenous ethics of care practices to address the indirect discrimination that AEWs experience.  It concludes with a map for recognition of AEWs' care practices on an institutional level in relation to academia and DECS, and in schools in order to overturn the continual marginalisation of AEWs in South Australia.  It argues for a values shift for non-Indigenous teachers and staff in schools and at the institutional levels in DECS and academia.  In particular, this involves a values shift by non-Indigenous teachers, academics and policy makers towards an understanding of whiteness.  Recommendations are provided in the concluding chapter that signpost possible moves towards equality of recognition of Indigenous ethics of care practices by non-Indigenous staff in schools.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Race</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Education Worker</field><field name="subject">Recognition</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090630.142151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internationalising English language education in Thailand: English language program for Thai   engineers</field><field name="creator">Hart-Rawung, Pornpimon</field><field name="description">This current research study is an outcome of the global expansion of English into the business world, the vigorous growth of the research in the area of English language acquisition as a second language and a global language, as well as of the researcher's passionate ESP teaching experience to university engineering students, and her pro-active engagement with Thai automotive engineers in the multi-national companies. Through investigating the English language learning and working experience of Thai automotive engineers, pictures about their needs on English language communication in the workplace are sketched; through looking into the perspectives of the university teachers and the international engineering professionals, the factors impacting on the needs of those automotive engineers in English language communication have been demonstrated. As a product of this research study, an ESP working syllabus has been designed to showcase the major findings of this stu dy, and to inform the current and future practices in English language learning and teaching for global engineers from the angles of program design.       In light of the principles in second language learning and teaching, and of the theoretical framework in Global English, this research study has been designed with a multi-faceted research strategy, which interweaves qualitative and quantitative research paradigms, and consists of questionnaire survey, in-depth interviews and case studies. The data obtained through this research strategy are analyzed through SPSS statistics, content analysis and triangulation.        The research participants were recruited from two settings: automotive engineering workplace and technological educational institutions in Thailand.  They include: 1) automotive engineers from an automotive-parts manufacturer, 2) foreign engineering professionals who co-work with the engineers from that manufacturing company, and 3) ESP teachers from the two selected technology universities of Thailand.       The results from this study indicate that proficiency in English communication has not only become a global passport for Thai automotive engineers, but also for the engineering organisations. It works as a source of power for both employees and employers, if they own it, in entering global automotive business to effectively function and compete, but as a challenge for those who do not possess this asset. It is believed that enhancing their English language proficiency for engineers is a key toward their generic skills building.       On the basis of the findings of this study, a 90-hour sample ESP syllabus spread out over a course of three months is developed. It employs an integrated model of syllabus design, having incorporated and balanced learner-centred approach, communicative approach and task-based approach. It combines classroom-based training sessions, self-directed learning and advisory sessions to introduce and strengthen the knowledge and skills and to mentor the engineers grow through the self-directed English learning process. Thus, the objectives of this sample ESP syllabus are to foster Thai engineers as not only proficient English communicators, but also as autonomous English learners. Through this learning process, they could get themselves better prepared for the challenges posed by this ever-changing world, while sowing seeds for nurturing future global leaders in the engineering profession.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Global Engineers</field><field name="subject">Second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">ESP</field><field name="subject">Global English</field><field name="subject">Curriculum Design</field><field name="subject">Self-directed Learning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090715.100731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and characterisation of genes controlling the resistance response to ascochyta blight (Ascochyta rabiei (Pass.) Labrousse) in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.)</field><field name="creator">Coram, Tristan Edward</field><field name="description">Ascochyta blight, caused by Ascochyta rabiei (Pass.) Labrousse, is one of the most destructive diseases of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) worldwide.  Despite the existence of highly resistant uncultivated genotypes, attempts to develop cultivars with a high level of durable resistance have been unsuccessful. This study investigated the chickpea defence response to A. rabiei using a functional genomics approach, which has the capacity to improve the overall understanding of the coordinated defence response at a molecular level.      An existing cDNA library was used to generate a resource of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) that, after clustering, comprised 516 unigenes.  The unigenes were functionally annotated resulting in the identification of 20 specific defence-related unigenes, as well as numerous transcripts with possible involvement in the coordination of defence responses.  To explore the expression patterns of the defence-related unigenes in an A. rabiei resistant and susceptible genotype, the unigenes were employed as probes in microarrays.  Resulting expression data was analysed to identify differentially expressed unigenes over a time-course after infection.  Comparison of the expression profiles from the resistant and susceptible genotype identified three putative genes that were exclusively up-regulated in the resistant genotype, thus may be involved in an effective defence response.       Considering that a defence response can involve hundreds of genes, the entire set of chickpea unigenes were used to construct large-scale microarrays.  To supplement the chickpea probes, 156 putative defence-related grasspea (Lathyrus sativus L.) ESTs and 41 lentil (Lens culinaris Med.) Resistance Gene Analogs (RGAs) were also included.  Expression profiles for three chickpeas and one wild relative were generated over a time course.  97 differentially expressed ESTs were identified using a robust experimental system that included confirmation by quantitative RT-PCR.  The results indicated that genes involved in the active defence response were similar to those governed by R-gene mediated resistance, including the production of reactive oxygen species and the hypersensitive response, down-regulation of 'housekeeping' gene expression, and expression of pathogenesis-related proteins.  The comparison between resistant and susceptible genotypes identified certain gene expression 'signatures' that may be predictiv e of resistance.       To further characterise the regulation of potential defence-related genes, the microarray was used to study expression profiles of the three chickpea genotypes (excluding the wild relative) after treatment with the defence signalling compounds, ethylene (E), salicylic acid (SA), and jasmonate (JA).  425 ESTs were differentially expressed, and comparison between genotypes revealed the presence of a wider range of inducible defence responses in resistant genotypes.  Linking the results with the previous microarray results indicated the presence of other pathogen-specific signalling mechanisms in addition to E, SA and JA.  The lower arsenal of defence-related gene expression observed in the susceptible genotype may be a result of 'breaks' in the pathways of defence-related gene activation.      To draw together the findings of all experiments, a model was constructed for a hypothetical mechanism of chickpea resistance to A. rabiei.  The model was synthesised based on the evidence gathered in this study and previously documented defence mechanisms in chickpea, and identified signal transduction as a key to resistance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chickpea</field><field name="subject">Ascochyta blight</field><field name="subject">Microarray</field><field name="subject">EST</field><field name="subject">Defence</field><field name="subject">Resistance</field><field name="subject">Quantitative RT-PCR</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090715.110720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impressions from Virtual Landscapes</field><field name="creator">McMasters, Neil G</field><field name="description">The aim of this project was to build and render digital landscape models that reflect natural element characteristics and use the resulting data sets as source material for fine art investigation and production.

As capture fisheries resources have come under pressure and perhaps reached their sustainable limit concern has been expressed over the ability to continue to meet the protein needs of expanding populations.  One potentially significant contributor to addressing the food needs of the world is marine farming (mariculture).  The expansion of marine farming in developing countries has been well-addressed in the literature, but marine farming in developed countries has received less attention.  The traditional biophysical requirements of marine farming (sheltered clean water of appropriate depth) have led to conflicts with other users of the coastal environment.  In the developed countries in particular, suitable sites are contested places of consumption (recreation, tourism) as well as production (capture fisheries).  Moreover, the adjacent terrestrial land and water uses can significantly affect acceptability of marine farming.  The avoidance of conflicts and the achievement of sustainable development in such settings are largely dependent on the systems of governance.  In developed countries, these are often articulated through planning regimes and associated 'rights'.  The global terrestrial planning response in the first two thirds of the 20th Century was dominated by a modernist approach to planning.  In the later stages, a post-modern challenge coincided with the rise of neo-liberalism in many developed countries.  Planning in New Zealand has shown a similar pattern.  The extent to which modern, postmodern and neo-liberal approaches might have been manifest in the marine environment, especially with regard to marine farming, has received little attention.  In most developed countries there has been an institutional separation between terrestrial and marine administrative agencies that has resulted in conflict between these agencies and between the regimes they work within and help create. Integrated Coastal Management emerged as a response to this situation and had become the dominant planning regime for coastal resources by the last decade of the 20th Century.  It was largely uncritically promoted and accepted, especially by United Nations and coastal state government agencies.  These themes provide the broad theoretical and practical context for this thesis.  Since the 1970s, there has been a revolutionary break in New Zealand's resource management from a centralized command and control style of modernist planning to a neo-liberal, planning regime characterised by elements of modernism and postmodernism.  Concurrently it has revamped, but failed to integrate, coastal and fisheries management and planning.  Ironically, each of the resulting primary marine resource management statutes (the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) and the Fisheries Act 1983/1996 (FA83/96)) is considered to implement a world-leading model.  Marine farming lies at the interface between the regimes created by these and preceding Acts and the nature of the regimes is explored in relation to marine farming.  The development of the regimes and the rationale for them is set out with the aid of Scott's (1989, 2000b) axial model of the characteristics of a property right.  The thesis groups the development of the New Zealand planning regimes for marine farming into four era: pre-modern (1866-1964), proto-modern (1964-1971), modern (1971-1991), and transitional (1991-2001).  The evolution of the industry is shown largely to follow a generalized model of the industry in developed countries.  This suggests that the nature of the property rights available for marine farming in New Zealand is not of great significance in the general development of the industry.  The planning regime, however, significantly affects the spatial pattern of development of the industry.  An analysis of provisions for marine farms in various plans suggests quite different planning 'styles' and approaches have been adopted in different parts of the country at different times.  A Geographic Information System of all individual marine farms in New Zealand is developed to the stage where it can be combined with other data to investigate the spatial patterns that have evolved in New Zealand.  A typology of patterns of farm arrangement in relation to other farms is apparent from the resultant mapped information. These patterns are shown to represent the outcomes of a combination of competing rights and the responses of and to the contemporaneous planning regimes.  The consequences of adopting different styles of planning are apparent.  This macro-level research is extended to the micro-level by an exploration of variables affecting the individual farmer's locational decisions.  A national postal questionnaire survey of marine farm owners yielded 148 usable responses (32% response rate).  Inferential statistical analytical tools were used to test the significance of relationships between particular variables.  Multivariate analyses were used to cluster the respondents and the variables and to search for latent factors.  These analyses supported field interview findings with regard to the importance of particular variables, especially planning regimes in directing the location and nature of marine farming.  The results enabled development of a descriptive model for exploring and comparing the quality of different means of acquiring marine space for marine farming.  The analyses also confirmed that significant changes were occurring within the structure of the industry.  Analysis of the field interviews, maps, policy documents, Environment Court decisions and other secondary material shows the major capture fishing companies are increasingly dominating the industry.  There was a notable presence of a category of 'entrepreneur site developers' exploiting the neo-liberal nature of the planning regimes of the 1990s to open up new areas for marine farming on scales unprecedented in the rest of the world.  The consequent race for space has met with stiff resistance from the capture fishing industry, but more especially from the recreational sector.  This has led to significant transaction costs.  The Government response, a partial moratorium on marine farm development in November 2001, is shown to emulate the modernist command and control style of planning of twenty years earlier and to signal a failure of neo-liberal ideology to meet the needs of the industry and the public at large.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aquaculture</field><field name="subject">marine farming</field><field name="subject">mariculture</field><field name="subject">property rights</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">spatial planning</field><field name="subject">location</field><field name="subject">aquaculture law</field><field name="subject">marine policy</field><field name="subject">governance</field><field name="subject">integrated coastal management</field><field name="subject">allocation processes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Economic Analysis of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point-Based Risk Management Programme in the New Zealand Meat Industry</field><field name="creator">Cao, Kay Quy Thanh Thi</field><field name="description">The replacement of the Meat Act 1981 by the Animal Products Act 1999 opened a new era for food safety management in New Zealand. Administering food legislation is now the sole responsibility of the New Zealand Food Safety Authority instead of being shared between the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Health as previously. At the core of the legislative change is the requirement for Risk Management Programmes (RMP). Every single animal primary processing business is required to have an RMP for each type of product. An RMP is required to embrace the principles of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP). While there have been some studies considering the implementation of HACCP in food businesses worldwide, there has not been any study focusing on HACCP adoption in New Zealand. The mandating of RMP has also made the implementation process more complex. On the other hand, it also brings new experience in terms of food safety management. This thesis examines the implementation process of HACCP/RMP in New Zealand. It also explores the interaction between food safety management and international competitiveness through an economic analysis of the impacts of the program on a New Zealand food processing industry. The meat industry was chosen as a case study as it is one of the first industries that had to comply with the first deadline of the implementation (July 2003). Also, being a significant export-oriented industry of New Zealand, the meat industry provides an ideal case for the purpose of this study. The thesis consists of four parts. Part I presents an introduction to the study including a review of  international and national food safety issues, the relationship between food safety and trade and international competitiveness, and the HACCP economic literature. This background helps to shape the research objectives and methodology as described in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 discusses the design of the survey to collect plant experience regarding the implementation of HACCP/RMP in New Zealand. Part II analyses the experiences within the New Zealand meat industry regarding the implementation of HACCP/RMP. It discusses plant motivations to adopt the program and the implementation issues they are facing. Plant observations on the costs and benefits of the implementation are reported. Further, data gathered from the survey are used in a non-parametric analysis of the influences of the plant characteristics on the HACCP/RMP implementation process. The analysis provides implications for HACCP/RMP policy design. Part III presents the modelling techniques to quantify the costs and benefits of HACCP/RMP implementation. In Chapter 8, a quality-adjusted cost function is used to estimate the change in variable cost of production due to HACCP/RMP. It shows that this type of cost can make up a significant proportion of the total implementation cost. In Chapter 9, an export model is employed to analyse the impact of HACCP/RMP on meat industry export performance. The results show that the programme can bring a positive impact on exports. However, the magnitude of the impact depends on the status of existing food safety management before HACCP/RMP implementation. In Chapter 10, the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model is used to simulate the scenarios where market accesses to significant export destinations are lost when HACCP/RMP is not adopted. The estimated costs of these losses signal the potential benefits of HACCP/RMP. The research results show that HACCP/RMP can deliver a net benefit to the New Zealand meat industry. The thesis concludes with implications for policy design and future research directions. It signifies that the research findings, in addition to reporting an investigation into HACCP/RMP implementation process in New Zealand, provide an important foundation for future research on food safety and international competitiveness.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">food safety economics</field><field name="subject">HACCP benefits and costs</field><field name="subject">New Zealand meat industry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an Intraruminal Controlled-Release Device</field><field name="creator">McLellan, Bradley John</field><field name="description">Slow-release devices retained in the rumen, are a simple method for continuous administration of bioactives to ruminant animals.  To satisfy regulatory requirements and avoid waste of bioactive due to under- or over-dosing, it is advantageous to have a constant and predictable release rate.  Existing intraruminal controlled-release technologies cannot easily be adapted for different bioactives or rates of release and can be influenced by the variable physiological environment in the rumen.  Some existing commercial products use the pressure generated by a hydrogen gas-producing cell to extrude fluids from a syringe-like device.  This technology may provide advantages for ruminal controlled-release as the gas production rate is unaffected by environment in the rumen and can be easily adjusted using electrical resistance applied to the gas cell.  This technology was adapted for use in the rumen in these studies. Initial experiments identified the need for greater understanding of the rate that hydrogen is produced by the gas cell and the rate that gas diffuses through the barrel walls.  Gas production rate was found to be inversely proportional to the resistance applied to the gas-producing cell.  Factors affecting gas diffusion rate from the device were studied and a polymer was identified that reduced hydrogen diffusion to 5% of that for the initial components used.  A relationship was developed to predict the release profile of a device.  Controlled-release devices were constructed from selected materials.  They released blank formulation at in vitro at a constant rate, which was within experimental variation of predicted values.  Release rates from the devices used in vivo were slightly higher than predicted.  The presence of rumen gases inside in vivo devices suggested that the difference may be due to inward diffusion of these gases; these may be eliminated by further study of barrel materials.  Recommendations on the redesign of this technology for use as a generic intraruminal delivery system are given.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gas-producing cell</field><field name="subject">hydrogen diffusion</field><field name="subject">carbon dioxide diffusion</field><field name="subject">gas diffusion</field><field name="subject">polyoxymethylene</field><field name="subject">nylon</field><field name="subject">mathematical model</field><field name="subject">sustained release bolus</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Easing the Transition from Inspiration to Implementation: A Rapid Prototyping Platform for Wireless Medium Access Control Protocols</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, Dean Andrew</field><field name="description">Packet broadcast networks are in widespread use in modern wireless communication systems. Medium access control is a key functionality within such technologies.  A substantial research effort has been and continues to be invested into the study of existing protocols and the development of new and specialised ones.  Academic researchers are restricted in their studies by an absence of suitable wireless MAC protocol development methods.  This thesis describes an environment which allows rapid prototyping and evaluation of wireless medium access control protocols.  The proposed design flow allows specification of the protocol using the specification and description language (SDL) formal description technique.  A tool is presented to convert the SDL protocol description into a C++ model suitable for integration into both simulation and implementation environments.  Simulations at various levels of abstraction are shown to be relevant at different stages of protocol design. Environments based on the Cinderella SDL simulator and the ns-2 network simulator have been developed which allow early functional verification, along with detailed and accurate performance analysis of protocols under development.  A hardware platform is presented which allows implementation of protocols with flexibility in the hardware/software trade-off. Measurement facilities are integral to the hardware framework, and provide a means for accurate real-world feedback on protocol performance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wireless</field><field name="subject">medium access control</field><field name="subject">MAC</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="subject">SDL</field><field name="subject">networking</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General Boolean Expressions in Publish-Subscribe Systems</field><field name="creator">Bittner, Sven</field><field name="description">The increasing amount of electronically available information in society today is undeniable. Examples include the numbers of general web pages, scientific publications, and items in online auctions. From a user's perspective, this trend will lead to information overflow. Moreover, information publishers are compromised by this situation, as users have greater difficulty in identifying useful information.     Publish-subscribe systems can be applied to cope with the reality of information overflow. In these systems, users specify their information interests as subscriptions and, subsequently, only matching information (event messages) is delivered; uninteresting information is filtered out before reaching users. In this dissertation, we consider content-based publish-subscribe systems, a sophisticated example of these systems. They perform the information-filtering task based on the content of provided information. In order to deal with high numbers of subscriptions and frequencies of event messages, publish-subscribe systems are realized as distributed systems. Advertisements---publisher specifications of potential future event messages---are optionally applied in these systems to reduce the internal distribution of subscriptions.     Existing work on content-based publish-subscribe concepts mainly focuses on subscriptions and advertisements as pure conjunctive expressions. Therefore, subscriptions or advertisements using operators other than conjunction need to be canonically converted to disjunctive normal form by these systems. Each conjunctive component is then treated as individual subscription or advertisement. Unfortunately, the size of converted expressions is exponential in the worst case.     In this dissertation, we show that the direct support of general Boolean subscriptions and advertisements improves the time and space efficiency of general-purpose content-based publish-subscribe systems. For this purpose, we develop suitable approaches for the filtering and routing of general Boolean expressions in these systems. Our approaches represent solutions to exactly those components of content-based publish-subscribe systems that currently restrict subscriptions and advertisements to conjunctive expressions.     On the subscription side, we present an effective generic filtering algorithm, and a novel approach to optimize event routing tables, which we call subscription pruning. To support advertisements, we show how to calculate the overlap between subscriptions and advertisements, and introduce the first designated subscription routing optimization, which we refer to as advertisement pruning. We integrate these approaches into our prototype BoP (BOolean Publish-subscribe) which allows for the full support of general Boolean expressions in its filtering and routing components.     In the evaluation part of this dissertation, we empirically analyze our prototypical implementation BoP and compare its algorithms to existing conjunctive solutions. We firstly show that our general-purpose Boolean filtering algorithm is more space- and time-efficient than a general-purpose conjunctive filtering algorithm. Secondly, we illustrate the effectiveness of the subscription pruning routing optimization and compare it to the existing covering optimization approach. Finally, we demonstrate the optimization effect of advertisement pruning while maintaining the existing overlapping relationships in the system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Boolean expressions</field><field name="subject">publish-subscribe</field><field name="subject">subscription pruning</field><field name="subject">advertisement pruning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a neoliberal citizenship regime: A post-Marxist discourse analysis</field><field name="creator">Hackell, Melissa</field><field name="description">This thesis is empirically grounded in New Zealand's restructuring of unemployment and taxation policy in the 1980s and 1990s.  Theoretically it is inspired by a post-Marxist discourse analytical approach that focuses on discourses as political strategies.  This approach has made it possible, through an analysis of changing citizenship discourses, to understand how the neoliberalisation of New Zealand's citizenship regime proceeded via debate and struggle over unemployment and taxation policy.  Debates over unemployment and taxation in New Zealand during the 1980s and 1990s reconfigured the targets of policy and re-ordered social antagonism, establishing a neoliberal citizenship regime and centring political problematic.  This construction of a neoliberal citizenship regime involved re-specifying the targets of public policy as consumers and taxpayers.  In exploring the hegemonic discourse strategies of the Fourth Labour Government and the subsequent National-led governments of the 1990s, this thesis traces the process of reconfiguring citizen subjectivity initially as 'social consumers' and participants in a coalition of minorities, and subsequently as universal taxpayers in antagonistic relation to unemployed beneficiaries.  These changes are related back to key discursive events in New Zealand's recent social policy history as well as to shifts in the discourses of politicians that address the nature of the public interest and the targets of social policy.  I argue that this neoliberalisation of New Zealand's citizenship regime was the outcome of the hegemonic articulatory discourse strategies of governing parties in the 1980s and 1990s.  Struggles between government administrations and citizen-based social movement groups were articulated to the neoliberal project.  I also argue that in the late 1990s, discursive struggle between the dominant parties to define themselves in difference from each other reveals both the 'de'contestation of a set of neoliberal policy prescriptions, underscoring the neoliberal political problematic, and the privileging of a contributing taxpayer identity as the source of political legitimacy.  This study shows that the dynamics of discursive struggle matter and demonstrates how the outcomes of discursive struggle direct policy change.  In particular, it establishes how neoliberal discourse strategies evolved from political discourses in competition with other discourses to become the hegemonic political problematic underscoring institutional practice and policy development.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">citizenship</field><field name="subject">post-Marxism</field><field name="subject">unemployment policy</field><field name="subject">taxation policy</field><field name="subject">New Zealand politics</field><field name="subject">citizenship regimes</field><field name="subject">social antagonism</field><field name="subject">workers' cooperative movement</field><field name="subject">Maori self-determination</field><field name="subject">political ideology</field><field name="subject">subject positions</field><field name="subject">articulation</field><field name="subject">Keynesian welfare state</field><field name="subject">neoliberal competition state</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is Semantic Query Optimization Worthwhile?</field><field name="creator">Genet, Bryan Howard</field><field name="description">The term quote semantic query optimization quote (SQO) denotes a methodology whereby queries against databases are optimized using semantic information about the database objects being queried. The result of semantically optimizing a query is another query which is syntactically different to the original, but semantically equivalent and which may be answered more efficiently than the original. SQO is distinctly different from the work performed by the conventional SQL optimizer. The SQL optimizer generates a set of logically equivalent alternative execution paths based ultimately on the rules of relational algebra. However, only a small proportion of the readily available semantic information is utilised by current SQL optimizers. Researchers in SQO agree that SQO can be very effective. However, after some twenty years of research into SQO, there is still no commercial implementation. In this thesis we argue that we need to quantify the conditions for which SQO is worthwhile. We investigate what these conditions are and apply this knowledge to relational database management systems (RDBMS) with static schemas and infrequently updated data. Any semantic query optimizer requires the ability to reason using the semantic information available, in order to draw conclusions which ultimately facilitate the recasting of the original query into a form which can be answered more efficiently. This reasoning engine is currently not part of any commercial RDBMS implementation. We show how a practical semantic query optimizer may be built utilising readily available semantic information, much of it already captured by meta-data typically stored in commercial RDBMS. We develop cost models which predict an upper bound to the amount of optimization one can expect when queries are pre-processed by a semantic optimizer. We present a series of empirical results to confirm the effectiveness or otherwise of various types of SQO and demonstrate the circumstances under which SQO can be effective.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">semantic query optimization</field><field name="subject">relational database</field><field name="subject">interval algebra</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Interventional Change Techniques on an Internet Banking Cross-functional Team.</field><field name="creator">Siritanachot, Chansit</field><field name="description">This study investigates the team aspects of a process improvement project situated in an Internet banking system maintenance and modification phase. To investigate how team processes could be improved in this context, four interventional change techniques were introduced and implemented during an action research study in which the researcher was included as one of the team members and participated during group meetings and discussions. Internet banking is an important Internet-delivered service which is expected to provide benefits for both commercial banks and bank customers. Internet banking allows bank customers to have the freedom to perform their financial activities at their convenience. Developing, maintaining, and improving Internet banking systems requires large amounts of investment to maintain high levels of Internet banking service quality, and the maintenance and modification phase of the overall lifecycle cost is a considerable part of this investment. Therefore, in order to ensure high levels of usability, reliability, and quality for these Internet banking services, commercial banks need to make significant investments in the maintenance and modification phases of their Internet banking systems' lifecycle. The four interventional change techniques used in this study were: departmental participation, equal participation, holistic scenario, and management support. The four techniques were found to be influential in developing process improvements in the maintenance and modification phase of Internet banking systems. These techniques generated several significant improvements which directly affected the way team members managed their work. The significant contributions of these interventional change techniques were: the creation of cross-functional multilevel teams, development of effective departmental participation and communication techniques, extended scope and knowledge by the team members of Internet banking systems, an increase in team learning and understanding, techniques to change problem structure, and an  end to end  problem-solving approach. ii These contributions also directly improved the performance of the Internet banking systems maintenance team, and there was a significant improvement in the outcomes of the Internet banking systems maintenance and modification phase.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">internet banking</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">interventional change techniques</field><field name="subject">multi-level teams</field><field name="subject">cross-functional teams</field><field name="subject">systems development</field><field name="subject">systems maintenance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychological Time: The effect of task complexity upon the human estimation of duration.</field><field name="creator">Webber, Simon</field><field name="description">This thesis was designed to investigate the effect of task complexity upon how humans estimate duration.  Previous task complexity research suggests that duration is overestimated with simple tasks and underestimated with complex tasks.  One-hundred and forty-two first and second year university students participated.  Twelve experiments were conducted, which required participants to complete computer generated jigsaw puzzles and periodically estimate how long they thought they had been doing the puzzle.  In Experiment 1, participants were required to complete a jigsaw puzzle before making an estimate.  In the remaining eleven experiments, estimates were made throughout the session whilst participants worked on the jigsaw puzzle.  In the first four experiments, a task was complex if there were more puzzle pieces and simpler if there were fewer puzzle pieces.  There were no significant results obtained from the first four experiments.  Given the lack of effect from the first four experiments, the next two experiments partially replicated two task complexity studies to determine how task complexity can be used as an explanation for why estimations of duration differ.  Again, there were no significant results obtained from these two experiments.  The next four experiments tested whether people's estimates of duration were affected by the rate of reinforcement they receive (i.e., successfully moving a puzzle piece to a new location per unit time).  In the first of these two experiments (7 and 8) there was no effect of the manipulation, which consisted of decreasing the distance which a puzzle piece could be moved on the screen, relative to the distance the computer mouse was moved and fixing the speed at which a puzzle piece could be moved.  In Experiments 9 and 10, more discriminative stimuli were used to indicate to participants that a change in the reinforcement rate was occurring.  There was a significant result in Experiment 9 in one condition but this effect was not replicated in Experiment 10.  In Experiment 11, the reinforcement rate was reduced to zero and there was a significant effect on participants' estimates of duration.  However, these results suggested a confound between whether the reinforcement rate or not being able to access the jigsaw puzzle was affecting estimates of duration.  In Experiment 12, access to the jigsaw puzzle was limited, whilst simultaneously controlling the reinforcement rate and the results showed that not having access to the jigsaw puzzle affected how participants estimate duration.  These findings suggest that information can act as reinforcement, enabling a person to engage in private behaviour.  When there is no access to reinforcement, time 'drags' for humans.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">time</field><field name="subject">reinforcement</field><field name="subject">rate</field><field name="subject">information</field><field name="subject">private events</field><field name="subject">BeT</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When citizen politics becomes uncivil: Between popular protest, civil society and governance in Jamaica</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Hume Nicola</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on the problem of incivility within the domains of citizen politics and civil society by exploring the proclivity for popular protest in Jamaica and the intersections between popular citizen protest, civil society and governance in this context. It scrutinizes the tenor of contemporary civilian politics and assesses the consequent impact on the quality of civil society more broadly. The thesis challenges the assumption within accepted definitions of civil society that civic participation is always positive. It does so by examining the manner in which citizens engage collectively to defend their interests and make claims upon the state, as well as the extent to which this model of political participation serves the agenda and promise of civil society. Through an in-depth, country-specific, empirical case study, the thesis examines micro social processes of power at community level to raise questions about who should be represented in civil society and how the voices of the marginalized are to be heard. In this regard, it explores the role of social inequality, feelings of social injustice and political exclusion as contributory factors in the existing tenor of citizen politics in Jamaica. It also examines the challenges facing the contemporary state and the impact of violent protests on state engagement, public action and political performance. The study analyses the lived experiences, observations and perspectives of a wide cross section of Jamaican citizens, gleaned from face-to-face interviews, focus group discussions, as well as a range of secondary material, including audio-visual data, to illuminate this process of struggle and underscore the factors which drive violent protests in this political context. The thesis concludes that maximum disruption, including violence, has not only become the basis of civil protest in Jamaica, but that the varied and contradictory responses of the state bureaucracy and political actors (Members of Parliament, activists, other political iii officials), as well as the mass media, have directly contributed to the style and tenor of protest politics in Jamaica. This state of affairs reduces popular citizen participation over genuine concerns to mob-style incivility and undermines civil society as a source of positive and responsible citizenship. The growing political importance of grassroots-based citizen participation and community building within the context of a global imperative to forge 'democracy from below' lends theoretical and normative credence to emerging concerns about the current character of popular citizen mobilizations and protest. This study thus establishes the basis for a presumption in favour of civility, civil discourse and civil action as fundamental to the construction of civil society. In doing so, it extends current scholarly understandings of civil society to Third World contexts, with a specific emphasis on Jamaica.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Popular protest</field><field name="subject">civil society</field><field name="subject">civility</field><field name="subject">incivility</field><field name="subject">Jamaica</field><field name="subject">governance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impacts of climate change on cattle water demand and supply in Khurutshe, Botswana</field><field name="creator">Masike, Sennye</field><field name="description">The primary question that the thesis investigates is: what impacts could climate change have on cattle water demand and supply in Khurutshe, Botswana. This thesis is pursued in light of the fact that there is a lack of knowledge on climate change and cattle water demand and supply. Thus, this thesis aims at filling the gap in knowledge on climate change and cattle water resources in Botswana and other semi-arid environments. A cattle water demand and supply model is developed to investigate the primary question of the thesis. The model is driven by rainfall and temperature over time as these variables largely determine cattle water supply and demand, respectively. Climate scenarios for 2050 are constructed using SimCLIM (developed by the International Global Change Institute of the University of Waikato) based on HadCM3 and CSIRO Mk2 General Circulation Models (GCMs). Three Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) are used: A1B, A1FT and A1T. These emission scenarios were selected based on their coverage for possible future Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHG). Climate scenarios show that by 2050 the temperature for the Khurutshe area could increase by as much as 3 oC depending on the GCM and SRES emission scenario and that there could be a decline in rainfall of up to 14% per month. CSIRO Mk2 displayed the maximum decline in rainfall while HadCM3 depicted the maximum increase in temperature.  The model is implemented in the Khurutshe of the Kgatleng District, Botswana. The results reported are for Masama Ranch and also for the whole of the Khurutshe area. The results show that climate change could lead to an annual increase of more than 20% in cattle water demand by 2050 due to an increase in temperature. In addition, climate change could lead to a decline in the contribution of surface pan water to cattle water supply. Overall, there could be an increase in abstraction of groundwater for cattle by 2050 due to an increase in demand and a decline in forage water content and surface pan water. Observations in semi-arid environments of Africa indicate that farmers encounter problems of declining borehole yields and local depletion in groundwater in summer and drought years when demand peaks. In addition, it has been observed that during drought more cattle are lost as a result of lack of water, particularly for those whose cattle are reliant on surface water. Thus, the results from this study indicate that climate change could enhance this problem. In the thesis I have shown the importance of integrating climate change impacts on water demand and supply when assessing water resources, which has been ignored in the past. Some of the policy options that are discussed are tradable pumping permits for controlling abstraction and allocation issues in the Khurutshe aquifer and, controlling stocking numbers. This is in recognition of the fact that climate change could result in more reliance on groundwater for both cattle farming and urban water supply hence compromising sustainability and allocation issues especially for the Khurutshe aquifer which is earmarked to supply the city of Gaborone and surrounding villages in drought periods.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cattle</field><field name="subject">water demand</field><field name="subject">water supply</field><field name="subject">forage water content</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">system dynamics modeling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">M&#257;ori Women and Gambling: Every Day is a War Day!</field><field name="creator">Morrison, Laurie Elena</field><field name="description">This study was concerned with the health implications of new forms of gambling such as casinos, pokie machines and internet gambling for M&#257;ori women and their families in Auckland and the Bay of Plenty region of Aotearoa (New Zealand). It set out to discover what culturally appropriate services were available and the extent to which M&#257;ori women gamblers were utilising them. The literature documenting M&#257;ori perceptions of gambling shows that M&#257;ori women gamblers and their partner/wh&#257;nau members and gambling service providers have been little studied previously. These goals translated into the following specific aims: 1) to study how M&#257;ori women problem gamblers, their partner or wh&#257;nau members and key informants perceived gambling, what it meant to them and why they did it; 2) to investigate the consequences of gambling for M&#257;ori women, wh&#257;nau and service providers in dealing with the effects of gambling; 3) to report on how these three groups dealt with the effects of gambling; and 4) to discover what helped to bring about positive changes for the three groups. All of the aims were achieved. A M&#257;ori approach (Kaupapa M&#257;ori), combined with a naturalistic approach to data collection, was adopted. Qualitative methods are most appropriate to use when working with some M&#257;ori, as there is a growing realisation that research with M&#257;ori needs to be interactive. A M&#257;ori research procedure modelled on the ritual ceremony of encounter (P&#333;whiri) provided an appropriate structure for the development and presentation of the research process. The major focus was on the qualitative data obtained from semi-structured interviews in two locations - Rotorua and Auckland. The interviews were conducted with twenty M&#257;ori women gamblers, sixteen wh&#257;nau members including partners and ten interviews with staff involved in services that provided help for problem gamblers. The three interview schedules were based on a number of broad themes and open-ended questions to obtain meaningful descriptive data. The interviews were audio recorded and used to produce transcripts that were then sent back to the participants for feedback. Qualitative data analysis was conducted on the returned documents. The findings from this study revealed major impacts of the women's socio-economic, familial and societal circumstances on gambling behaviour and its effects, which are areas of concern for mental health professionals and researchers. The mythical M&#257;ori canoes on which M&#257;ori voyaged from their place of origin (Hawaiiki) to Aotearoa, the Waka, provided an appropriate metaphor to present the interrelationship between the pull and push factors toward gambling, and its implications for society. This is illustrated as a spinning waka, Te Waka H&#363;rihuri. On the other hand, Te Waka M&#257;ia (courageous) demonstrates the relationships between the variables that help M&#257;ori women gamblers to cope and helpful strategies found to assist them to modify or stop their gambling behaviour. It is recommended that the government limit the proliferation of gaming venues and continue to encourage development of emerging M&#257;ori services. Moreover, a coordinated approach is essential, as M&#257;ori women gamblers, partners and wh&#257;nau members need to heal together for positive outcomes for M&#257;ori health development in Aotearoa. The main implication of this study is that a wide range of further research into M&#257;ori and gambling is required. Recommendations on ways in which the current delivery of services in Rotorua and Auckland could be improved are: 	That the Ministry of Health purchase services that establish support groups for M&#257;ori people with problem gambling and their wh&#257;nau, and 	That non-M&#257;ori provider services and organisations support the development of emerging M&#257;ori services. Heeding the outcome of this research should help improve New Zealand's existing health policy and capacity for M&#257;ori women's health development. It should also enrich our understanding of the adaptation patterns of M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau member/s, and thus should have implications, not only for M&#257;ori health policies, but also relevance for the wider field of international cross-comparative research on indigenous gambling and mental health issues.  Limitations of this study included a small, localised sample that means the findings can only tentatively be generalised to the wider population of M&#257;ori women gamblers. Nonetheless, information gained from the study contributes to understanding of the adaptation patterns of M&#257;ori women gamblers, their wh&#257;nau member/s, and those who are trying to help them.  It is hoped that the study will make it at least a little less true that  every day is a war day  for M&#257;ori women and their wh&#257;nau trying to deal with the problem of gambling.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Gambling</field><field name="subject">Addictions</field><field name="subject">Indigenous</field><field name="subject">Maori Health Development</field><field name="subject">Powhiri</field><field name="subject">Problem gambling</field><field name="subject">Whanau</field><field name="subject">Health</field><field name="subject">Pokie Machines</field><field name="subject">Casino</field><field name="subject">Counselling</field><field name="subject">Counseling</field><field name="subject">Maori Service Providers</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa Maori Research</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa Maori Methodology</field><field name="subject">Maori Frameworks</field><field name="subject">Rotorua</field><field name="subject">Auckland</field><field name="subject">Socio-economic</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa Maori Gambling Interventions</field><field name="subject">Te Waka Maia</field><field name="subject">Te Waka Hurihuri</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing Effective Interfaces for Older Users</field><field name="creator">Hawthorn, Dan</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the factors that need to be considered in order to undertake successful design of user interfaces for older users. The literature on aging is surveyed for age related changes that are of relevance to interface design. The findings from the literature review are extended and placed in a human context using observational studies of older people and their supporters as these older people attempted to learn about and use computers. These findings are then applied in three case studies of interface design and product development for older users. These case studies are reported and examined in depth. For each case study results are presented on the acceptance of the final product by older people. These results show that, for each case study, the interfaces used led to products that the older people evaluating them rated as unusually suitable to their needs as older users. The relationship between the case studies and the overall research aims is then examined in a discussion of the research methodology. In the case studies there is an evolving approach used in developing the interface designs. This approach includes intensive contribution by older people to the shaping of the interface design. This approach is analyzed and is presented as an approach to designing user interfaces for older people. It was found that a number of non-standard techniques were useful in order to maximize the benefit from the involvement of the older contributors and to ensure their ethical treatment. These techniques and the rationale behind them are described. Finally the interface design approach that emerged has strong links to the approach used by the UTOPIA team based at the university of Dundee. The extent to which the thesis provides support for the UTOPIA approach is discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">UI</field><field name="subject">User Interfaces</field><field name="subject">aged</field><field name="subject">computers</field><field name="subject">Interface Design</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structured articulation of knowledge: The influence of question response structure on recipient attitude</field><field name="creator">Bircham-Connolly, Heather Jayne</field><field name="description">Business today is faced with discontinuity and unpredictable change, which makes many of the structured processes of yesteryear redundant or obsolete. Process-based transactions are being replaced with technology and increasingly organisations are recognising the importance of proactively managing their knowledge transactions, to remain competitive. While research on knowledge sharing is gaining the attention of researchers, almost invariably their focus has been on the factors influencing knowledge transfer at the macro-level in large multi-national organisations. Few have attempted to unravel the complexities of individual-to-individual micro-level knowledge sharing and those that have, for the most part have directed their investigations towards exploring factors that enhance or impede the source individual sharing their knowledge, rather than the recipient's receiving of knowledge. While questioning is implicit in knowledge sharing there are assumptions that underpin the structure of a question and these assumptions affect both the source and the recipient. This study investigates how the structure of a question posed to a source individual when eliciting knowledge, influences the attitude of a recipient individual towards the knowledge they receive from the question response. Drawing upon theoretical assumptions that underpin question structure, three hypotheses are posed to compare binary, open-ended and directed question responses. To test the hypotheses a progression of three independent studies were performed using laboratory and field experiments. The first study conducted in a laboratory, used a contrived scenario case as the knowledge context and the second study replicated this experiment in the field. The last study conducted in a single organisation, used real organisational knowledge as the knowledge context. Recipients of shared knowledge were found to be more favourably disposed towards question responses that were structured in a complex manner; open-ended and directed question responses were more favoured than binary question responses. ii There was no difference in recipient attitude between open-ended and directed question responses and recipient attitude towards the shared knowledge was found to be positively related to their intention to use the knowledge in the future. These findings are of significance as they illustrate the importance of structuring questions in a manner that is consistent with recipients of the shared knowledge being more favourably disposed towards the knowledge they have received. In an environment of ambiguity, complexity and uncertainty where decisions are nonprogrammed, strategic and imperative to the competitiveness of the organisation, no longer is the binary 'Yes' or 'No' compliance or audit style question, with its implicit assumptions, sufficient to elicit knowledge. It is important to recognise that often we do not know what we need to know until it is shared by someone. Further, when shared knowledge is cognitively processed with our current knowledge base, the new knowledge is likely to facilitate more informed decision-making. The more favourably disposed the recipient is towards the knowledge the more likely it is that they will use it in the future; knowledge is transferred.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">knowledge sharing</field><field name="subject">questioning</field><field name="subject">source</field><field name="subject">recipient</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2539</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching economics at secondary school level in the maldives: a cooperative learning model</field><field name="creator">Nazeer, Abdulla</field><field name="description">The dominant approach to the study of economics at secondary school level in the Maldives is teacher-centred methods based on behaviourist views of teaching and learning. Despite considerable research on the benefits of cooperative learning in economic education at the post-secondary level, very limited research has been conducted in secondary school classrooms in order to find ways of improving teaching and learning of economics. The purpose of this study was to enhance the teaching and learning of economics at secondary schools in the Maldives by trialing a cooperative learning model to enhance economics teachers' awareness of the impact that cooperative learning might have on student learning. This study explored a cooperative learning approach to teaching and learning economics in secondary schools and investigated teachers' and students' perceptions of cooperative learning.  Some elements of both ethnographic and grounded theory methodologies were employed and specific data collection methods included workshops, classroom observations, interviews, video tapes and student questionnaires. Nine teachers and 232 students were involved in this study. The research was conducted in three stages (pre-intervention, workshops to train the participants, and post-intervention) over a period of three months in three selected schools in Male', the Maldives. Four research themes were derived from the analysis of both pre and post intervention data. These themes were teaching issues, learning issues, cooperative learning implementing issues, and students' and teachers' reactions to cooperative learning.  In the pre-intervention phase, the teachers taught in a traditional manner, but after the intervention they incorporated elements of cooperative learning method to teach economics in their selected classes. The overall findings showed a considerable change in teachers' and students' attitudes and perceptions about traditional teacher-centred methods towards more student-centred methods of cooperative learning. It was evident that both teachers and students perceived cooperative learning to be an effective method of teaching. For example, the findings revealed that both teachers and students understood and could see the benefits that cooperative learning offered to the teaching and learning of economics. The students indicated that they liked working in groups and appreciated getting help from other students. In addition, the results revealed that students' interactions and involvement in classroom activities, as well as interest and motivation to learn economics, increased during the implementation of the cooperative learning model.  Furthermore, this study found a mismatch between home and the traditional teacher-centred school culture in the Maldives. In contrast, the findings suggest that the principles of cooperative learning match well with the cultural values of Maldivian society. Consequently, a revised model of cooperative learning is presented that includes the aspects of culture. Jordan (1985) argued that  educational practices must match with the children's culture  (p. 110) and thus culturally responsive teaching can help to minimise confusion and promote an academic community of learners that enables students to be more successful learners (Gay, 2000). This study suggests that training teachers and students for cooperative learning is salient for effective implementation of cooperative learning for a positive influence on students' learning and teachers' pedagogy. However, further research should be conducted to examine other aspects of teaching and learning which may also enhance this relationship.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teaching economics</field><field name="subject">learning economics</field><field name="subject">economic education</field><field name="subject">cooperative learning model</field><field name="subject">the Maldives</field><field name="subject">secondary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Concept of Development in Ulawa in Solomon Islands and its Implications for National Development Policy and Planning</field><field name="creator">Rohorua, Frederick Isom</field><field name="description">'Social development' and 'economic development' are complex concepts, concepts that may be interpreted very differently in different contexts and at different times.  Not only may the processes involved be different in different contexts, so too may be the criteria by which success is judged.  It is argued here that successive Solomon Islands governments have striven for social and economic development without taking full account of the real nature of Solomon Islands society.  What is needed is national development policy, planning and implementation that arise out of, and take fully into account, the historical, geographic and cultural context of Solomon Islands. On the whole, the socio-economic structure of Solomon Islands society is currently underpinned by a tri-partite hierarchy in which, for the majority of Solomon Islanders, kastom (traditional beliefs and practices) and church (the beliefs and practices endorsed by the church) take precedence over the state as legitimate forms of authority.  This inevitably poses problems for state-led development.  If socio-economic development activities are to be successful in achieving a better quality of life for all Solomon Islanders, including those who live in rural areas, they must take full account of the role of kastom and church in the lives of the people.  This must include an understanding of the differing concepts of development of people in different areas of the country such as those of Ulawa islanders that are discussed here.  The thesis begins with an introduction to the research (Chapter 1) in which the theoretical framework is located broadly within the postmodern paradigm.  In Chapter 2 the essentially qualitative and interpretive nature of the methodology is outlined and explained.  Chapter 3 provides a critical review of international development literature in which it is argued that official definitions and descriptions of development are based on production and deficit models.  The need to accommodate an indigenous and organic concept of development, one that takes account of the diversity of human experience, is stressed.  Chapter 4 provides an outline of Solomon Islands society. Here, the historical narrative is complemented by three metaphors - 'island', wantok and betelnut - which serve to reinforce and explain the nature of Solomon Islands society and the ways in which that society has been shaped by historical processes. Chapter 5 is devoted to a discussion of modern development activity in Solomon Islands, the main focus being on the period immediately preceding and following independence.  Chapter 6 explores, with particular reference to Ulawa Island, indigenous concepts of development and the impact of national development activities on rural-dwelling islanders. It also engages the issue of state reform, proposing a model based on a two tier system, with central government in its current form dealing directly with the people at constituency rather than provincial level.  Finally, Chapter 7 summarizes the main conclusions reached. It is noted that the failure of both pre- and post-independence governments to take full account of the nature of Solomon Islands society has been a major factor in the lack of effective development in the islands.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Solomon Islands</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">state</field><field name="subject">church</field><field name="subject">kastom</field><field name="subject">state reform</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Construction of lattice rules for multiple integration based on a weighted discrepancy</field><field name="creator">Sinescu, Vasile</field><field name="description">High-dimensional integrals arise in a variety of areas, including quantum physics, the physics and chemistry of molecules, statistical mechanics and more recently, in financial applications. In order to approximate multidimensional integrals, one may use Monte Carlo methods in which the quadrature points are generated randomly or quasi-Monte Carlo methods, in which points are generated deterministically. One particular class of quasi-Monte Carlo methods for multivariate integration is represented by lattice rules. Lattice rules constructed throughout this thesis allow good approximations to integrals of functions belonging to certain weighted function spaces. These function spaces were proposed as an explanation as to why integrals in many variables appear to be successfully approximated although the standard theory indicates that the number of quadrature points required for reasonable accuracy would be astronomical because of the large number of variables. The purpose of this thesis is to contribute to theoretical results regarding the construction of lattice rules for multiple integration. We consider both lattice rules for integrals over the unit cube and lattice rules suitable for integrals over Euclidean space. The research reported throughout the thesis is devoted to finding the generating vector required to produce lattice rules that have what is termed a  low weighted discrepancy . In simple terms, the  discrepancy  is a measure of the uniformity of the distribution of the quadrature points or in other settings, a worst-case error. One of the assumptions used in these weighted function spaces is that variables are arranged in the decreasing order of their importance and the assignment of weights in this situation results in so-called  product weights . In other applications it is rather the importance of group of variables that matters. This situation is modelled by using function spaces in which the weights are  general . In the weighted settings mentioned above, the quality of the lattice rules is assessed by the  weighted discrepancy  mentioned earlier. Under appropriate conditions on the weights, the lattice rules constructed here produce a convergence rate of the error that ranges from O(n&#8722;1/2) to the (believed) optimal O(n&#8722;1+&#948;) for any &#948; gt 0, with the involved constant independent of the dimension.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lattice rules</field><field name="subject">quasi-Monte Carlo methods</field><field name="subject">numerical multiple integration</field><field name="subject">weighted discrepancy</field><field name="subject">component-by-component construction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance of Hemp-Fibre Reinforced Polypropylene Composite Materials</field><field name="creator">Beckermann, Gareth</field><field name="description">Increasing worldwide environmental awareness is encouraging scientific research into the development of cheaper, more environmentally friendly and more sustainable construction and packaging materials. Natural fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites are strong, stiff, lightweight and recyclable, and have the potential to meet this need.  Industrial hemp fibre is amongst the strongest of the natural fibres available, and possesses a similar specific stiffness to E-glass, but with additional benefits such as low cost and low production energy requirements.  The favourable mechanical properties of hemp, however, have yet to be transferred successfully to thermoplastic-matrix composite materials.  The aim of this thesis was to achieve a greater understanding of the various parameters that contribute to composite strength and stiffness, and to manipulate these parameters in order to produce an improved hemp fibre reinforced polypropylene composite material.  Hemp fibre was alkali treated at elevated temperatures in a small pressure vessel with either a solution of 10wt% NaOH or 5wt% NaOH / 2wt% Na2SO3.  Single fibre tensile tests were performed on treated and untreated fibres, and it was found that the NaOH/Na2SO3 treatment produced the strongest and stiffest fibres with a good level of fibre separation.  Lignin tests revealed that both alkali treatments were effective in the removal of lignin from hemp fibre, and XRD analysis showed that both alkali treatments resulted in increases in the hemp fibre crystallinity index.  TGA and DTA analysis showed that the alkali fibre treatments improved the thermal stability of the treated hemp fibre when compared to the untreated fibre.  Alkali treated hemp fibre, polypropylene and a maleic anhydride modified polypropylene (MAPP) coupling agent were compounded in a twin-screw extruder, and injection moulded into composite tensile test specimens.  A range of composites with different fibre and MAPP contents were produced and tested.  Tensile tests revealed that the optimum composite consisted of polypropylene with 40wt% NaOH/Na2SO3 treated hemp fibre and 4wt% MAPP, and had a tensile strength of 50.5 MPa and a Young's modulus of 5.31 GPa, respectively.  The effect of MAPP on the fibre/matrix interface of NaOH/Na2SO3 treated hemp fibre/polypropylene composites was assessed by means of the single fibre fragmentation test.  A composite consisting of NaOH/Na2SO3 treated fibres in a matrix of 4wt% MAPP and polypropylene was found to have a critical fibre length of 0.83mm and an interfacial shear strength of 16.1 MPa.  The effects of MAPP on the composite fracture mechanisms were evaluated by means of SEM microscopy.  TGA and DTA analysis showed that untreated hemp fibre composites and NaOH/Na2SO3 treated hemp fibre composites, each with a matrix of 4% MAPP and polypropylene, were less thermally stable than the polypropylene matrix alone.  The Bowyer-Bader model was used to model the strength of an injection moulded composite with a normal fibre length distribution, consisting of 40wt% NaOH/Na2SO3 treated fibre, 4% MAPP and polypropylene.  A theoretical composite tensile strength of 149 MPa was obtained from the model, based on the assumption that all the fibres were axially aligned in the composite.  Composites with long, axially aligned fibres were produced using a novel solution mixing technique, where the polymer matrix and MAPP coupling agent were dissolved in a solvent and then precipitated inside an aligned fibre mat.  Significant improvements in tensile strength and Young's modulus were achieved for solution mixed composites compared to composites produced by means of extrusion and injection moulding.  The strongest solution mixed composite had a tensile strength of 84.7 MPa, and consisted of 56wt% NaOH/Na2SO3 treated fibre, 4% MAPP and polypropylene; and the stiffest injection moulded composite had a Young's modulus of 16.0 GPa, and consisted of 63wt% NaOH/Na2SO3 treated fibre, 4% MAPP and polypropylene.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">composite materials</field><field name="subject">hemp</field><field name="subject">polypropylene</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the Training of Pre-Service Physics Teachers in Malaysia using Didaktik Analysis</field><field name="creator">Ishak, Mohd. Zaki</field><field name="description">The research in this thesis examined the use of a didaktik-based approach to thinking about teaching and learning to the training of pre-service physics teachers in a Malaysian teacher training programme. The process of developing a specific content knowledge (real or true physics) was done through a didaktik analysis of specific physics content, to develop physics content knowledge suitable for schooling, in a particular educational context. Didaktik analysis used as intervention in this study involved: analysing specific physics content as contained in the curriculum specifications and textbooks; analysis of literature on students' alternative conceptions; developing a lesson plan; developing teaching sequences that involve teaching and learning activities, enacting lesson plans and teaching sequence in the microteaching and practicum, and subsequent reflection. Klafki's (2000) model of didaktik analysis was used as the basis of an intervention employed in a physics teaching methods course (TT4133) at the School of Education, University of Malaysia Sabah (UMS). The intervention consisted of the 14 week course: first seven weeks on theoretical aspects of teaching methods, followed the usual course synopsis, but with modifications in content resulting from didaktik analysis, and the remainder dealt with microteaching; and 8 weeks practicum.  To illustrate the use of didaktik analysis in the training programme, the specific physics content in the areas of force and motion was provided as an example, showing how this was presented to the pre-service physics teachers in the programme. The researcher began with a conceptual analysis of force and motion as presented in the Malaysian secondary physics curriculum specifications and textbooks. This was followed by analysis of the science education literature on students' alternative conceptions involving force and motion, analysis of textbooks presentations of force and motion, and importantly a synopsis of the history of scientific thinking about force and motion. Subsequently, the pre-service teachers were required to prepare lesson plans aided by the researcher based on the above tasks, and this was followed by the development of a teaching sequence which was intended to be implemented in teaching practice with peers (called microteaching in Malaysia), and after further refinement in the practicum in a real classroom (under supervision). Participants were third year (15 males and 20 females) and fourth year (18 males and 60 females) pre-service physics teachers in their final year of undergraduate studies. The third year cohort consisted of experienced primary school teachers seeking to become secondary school physics teachers via a three-year conversion course. The fourth year cohort had no prior teaching experience, but held degree-level qualifications in physics. Quantitative data were gathered through two tests of conceptual understanding, The Test of Understanding Graph in Kinematics, TUG-K and The Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation, FMCE tests, and a purpose-designed instrument the Beliefs About Physics Teaching, BAPT questionnaire. Qualitative data were constructed through the inspection of self-written reports about prior physics learning experiences, inspection of assignments on the didaktik analysis of physics, and individual lesson plans. Video recording and field notes made during observations of microteaching and the practicum, examination of 'written reflections' done in the middle of the methods course, during the practicum, and in the final examinations, and interviews and field notes made by the researcher during meetings with the pre-service physics teachers, completed the data corpus. The research findings indicate that generally both cohorts had difficulty understanding kinematics graphs, and weak conceptual understanding of Newtonian concepts. These findings support the findings from the BAPT questionnaire and interviews, which point to perceptions of lack of ability to teach physics, negative attitudes towards teaching specific physics topics at the secondary level, and overall low physics teaching self-efficacy. Overall the findings from the BAPT questionnaire and interviews, before the intervention based on didaktik analysis of physics suggest that these pre-service physics teachers' attitude toward, and beliefs about, physics teaching were based on career interest in teaching, and not on any intrinsic interest in physics or physics teaching as a profession. After the didaktik analysis intervention it seems that the pre-service physics teachers' teaching practices were shaped by their beliefs about, and experiences of, the physics teaching methods course generally, and the didaktik analysis experience in particular. Overall, it seems this part of methods course helped to improve pre-service physics teachers' understanding of specific physics content, improved their attitude-toward-physics and teaching, helped them to identify problems with students' learning of physics concepts, and helped their teaching practice, subsequently making them more confident about teaching secondary school physics. The pre-service physics teachers commented on the value of didaktik analysis and this was evident in the microteaching, but not in lesson plans and teaching sequence used in the practicum. It seems this was as a result of a limited amount and a drive by schools to adhere to curriculum specifications. Overall it seems the introduction of didaktik-based analysis intervention increased participants' confidence to teach secondary school physics and that these pre-service physics teachers have gone some way in developing into reflective practitioners in terms of their experiences of: their own secondary physics learning; their physics methods course, both of which led to a better and deeper understanding of physics and methods course content; and the teaching practices in the microteaching and practicum, both of which gave confidence to teach secondary school physics. Three recommendations are made from this thesis. First, the introduction of a didaktik analysis-based intervention in physics teaching methods courses such as the one in this study, necessitates identification in advance of pre-service physics teachers' attitude toward, and beliefs about physics teaching, along with their attitude-toward-physics and learning, their physics teaching self-efficacy beliefs, and their conceptual understanding of specific physics content. Second, didaktik analysis involving other specific physics content, with other cohorts of pre-service physics teachers, experienced secondary physics teachers, and physicists, is worthy of consideration. Third, the success of the use of a didaktik-based analysis in a physics teaching methods courses requires scaffolding of the teaching sequences employed, and strong support from associate/mentor teachers during the practicum, if didaktik-based teaching is to be realized in the classroom.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supporting Organisational Critical Activities From Web Sites: An Evaluation Methodology Development</field><field name="creator">Hung, Wei-Hsi (Frank)</field><field name="description">quot; Organisational critical activities quot; (OCAs) are activities which must be conducted by the organisation constantly in order to be successful in the industry. They are recognised as being essential to short, medium, and long-term success in that industry, have been significantly resourced and receive regular senior management monitoring and direction. Although these activities are extremely important, some empirical studies have shown that they are not well supported by organisations, particularly in the area of Web support. This thesis develops an evaluation methodology called the quot;organisational critical activity Web support evaluation methodology quot; (OCAWSEM) which can be utilised to elicit OCAs from organisations, evaluate whether an organisation acutes; OCAs are being supported by its Web site, and provide guidance on how the organisation can improve its Web site. To develop the OCAWSEM, this thesis reviews the relevant literature and proposes a prototype OCAWSEM. A new iterative case design (ICD) approach has been used in order to further develop the prototype, and then to test the improved OCAWSEM. The selected field cases were eight universities in New Zealand. In total, 43 semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior teams, middle level managers, and Web teams. A systematic review of these universitiesacute Web sites was performed from the provideracutes, rather than the useracutes perspective. The outcome shows that the Developed OCAWSEM is a valid and reliable methodology for the evaluation of the support for OCAs from Web sites in the universities in New Zealand. This thesis provides useful lessons, drawn from the development and testing processes, as the basis from which to develop more specific OCAWSEMs for use in other organisational and industry contexts. Both practitioners and academicians can gain a deeper understanding of the notion of OCAs, better elicit OCAs from management, conduct Web site evaluations, and discuss the support of the Web sites for the OCAs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organisational critical activities</field><field name="subject">Web site evaluation</field><field name="subject">alignment</field><field name="subject">interpretive case studies</field><field name="subject">iterative case design</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainability of marketing systems: systeming interpretation of hybrid car manufacturer and consumer communications</field><field name="creator">Kadirov, Djavlonbek</field><field name="description">The purpose of this qualitative macromarketing investigation is to explore the issue of the sustainability of marketing systems. Drawing on complex systems thinking, an alternative logic of marketing systems and a methodological basis for interpreting communicated meanings are developed. The alternative logic of marketing systems recognises the unity of a difference between a marketing system and its environment. This insight has become a cornerstone for synthesising the systeming methodology. Systeming comprises the philosophy, the model, and the method of interpreting communication-as-self-observation of marketing system agents. Data, communication by hybrid car manufacturers and consumers, were collected from netnographic sources such as corporate websites, reports posted online, weblogs, and consumer forums. The interpretation of these data was accomplished using systeming procedures, e.g. communication analysis, distinction identification, re-entry description, and logical level tracking.      The systeming analysis of the hybrid car marketer and consumer communications illustrates that meaning-creation in the system is underpinned by purposeful human behaviour in reducing complexity of marketplace experience into a meaningful pattern, sustainability. Both manufacturers and consumers claim to become  sustainable  in reference to being  unsustainable  by creating self-referential differences, operating in different interaction contexts, and expanding meaning paradoxes. The interpretation shows that interactive meaning-creation in the system is inherently contradictory. Manufacturers expand (give a logical form to) contradictions through introducing hierarchical meaning structures, temporality, new functions, and communicative transvection. Consumers deal with the contradictions through enriching co-creation experiences and learning the proper continuation of specific hybrid car driving practices.              The significant insight gained from this investigation is that the hybrid car marketing system is not a passive entity; it is the locus of purposefully expanding meanings. Two modes of sustainability with regard to the hybrid car marketing system can be distinguished: the content of communication that denotes enacted meanings of sustainability and the form of communication that indicates how sustainable these sustainability enactments are. The content/form distinction implies that the sustainability of the hybrid car marketing system is a matter of interactive meaning-creation between system agents. The sustainable development process, in at least a mobility domain, is driven by purposeful social interaction rather than static product attributes.  This investigation is innovative because it a) offers a conceptualisation of a marketing system as a meaning flow; b) synthesises and compiles a methodology and method for interpreting communication in a marketing system; c) reveals systemic insights into the hybrid car marketing system; d) characterises the sustainability dimension of the hybrid car marketing system; e) explains a conceptual ground for reconciling the marketing system and society; f) provides a general macromarketing perspective to scrutinise recent conceptual developments in the marketing discipline; g) unifies marketing systems thinking with recent advancements in the marketing discipline, such as the service-dominant logic, and consumer culture theory; and, also, h) provides recommendations for a number of micro-managerial situations from a holistic perspective.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marketing systems</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">hybrid cars</field><field name="subject">systeming</field><field name="subject">macromarketing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2546</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching English to Young Learners in Taiwan: Issues relating to teaching, teacher education, teaching materials and teacher perspectives</field><field name="creator">Wang, Weipei</field><field name="description">Abstract Since 2005, it has been government policy in Taiwan to introduce English in Grade 3 of primary schooling (when learners are generally age 9). The overall aim of this research project was to investigate some of the problems associated with the implementation of this policy by combining research involving teacher cognition with research involving the criterion-referenced analysis of a sample of textbooks produced in Taiwan for young learners and a sample of lessons taught in Taiwanese primary schools. A questionnaire-based survey of a sample of teachers of English in Taiwanese primary schools (166 respondents) was conducted, focusing on teacher background and training, views about national and local policies, approaches to course content, methodology and teaching resources, and perceptions of their own proficiency in English and of their own training needs. Only 46 (27%) of the respondents reported that they had a qualification specific to the teaching of English and 41 (25%) reported that they had neither a qualification in teaching English nor a general primary teaching qualification. Many expressed dissatisfaction with the implementation of policies relating to the teaching of English at national level (46/ 29%), local level (39/24%) and in their own school (28/17%). Although many reported that the availability of resources (125/ 75%) and/ or student interest (101/ 61%) played a role in determining what they taught, none reported that the national curriculum guidelines did so. Although official policy in Taiwan endorses the use of 'communicative language teaching', only 103 (62%) of respondents reported that their own approach was communicatively-oriented, with 18 (11%) observing that they preferred grammar-translation. A more in-depth survey relating to teacher perception of pre- and in-service training was conducted using a questionnaire and semi-structured interview. Although all 10 participants in this survey are officially classified as being trained to teach English in Taiwanese primary schools, the type and extent of their training varied widely and all of them expressed dissatisfaction with that training, noting that they had no confidence in the trainers' own competence in teaching English to young learners. All claimed that critical issues were either omitted altogether or dealt with in a superficial way. One contextual factor that has a significant impact on teacher performance in Taiwan is the quality of the textbooks that are generally available. A sample of textbooks (3 different series) produced in Taiwan was analysed and evaluated, the analysis revealing that  the materials were often poorly organised, inappropriately selected and illustrated, contextually inappropriate. Finally, from a sample of twenty videotaped English lessons taught to students in primary schools in Taiwan, six that were considered to be typical were transcribed, analysed and evaluated in relation to criteria derived from a review of literature on teaching effectiveness. All of these lessons were found to be characterised by problems in a number of areas, including lesson focus, lesson staging, concept introduction, concept checking, and the setting up and conducting activities. It is concluded that the implementation of official policy on the teaching of English in primary schools in Taiwan is fraught with problems, problems that are evident at every stage in the process, from teacher education, through materials design to lesson planning and delivery.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EFL textbook evaluation (Taiwan); EFL lesson evaluation (Taiwan); teacher cognition and English language education (Taiwan); teaching English to young learners (Taiwan); the teaching of English in primary schools (Taiwan)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dispersal and remineralisation of biodeposits: Ecosystem impacts of mussel aquaculture</field><field name="creator">Giles, Hilke</field><field name="description">Suspension-feeding bivalves produce biodeposits (faeces and pseudofaeces) that have much higher sinking velocities than their constituent particles. Consequently they cause sedimentation of material that might otherwise not be deposited. The benthic remineralisation of biodeposits increases sediment oxygen demand and nutrient regeneration, thus enhancing the benthic-pelagic coupling of nearshore ecosystems. In New Zealand the mussel Perna canaliculus has a high natural abundance and is also intensively cultured. This thesis examines the dispersal and remineralisation characteristics of mussel P. canaliculus biodeposits and the impacts of sedimentation from a mussel farm in the Firth of Thames on sediment biogeochemistry by combining laboratory, field and modelling studies. Dispersal characteristics were examined in the laboratory by measuring sinking velocities and erosion thresholds of biodeposits produced by mussels of a wide size range fed three experimental diets. The results show that biodeposit dispersal is a function of mussel diet and size and thus could differ significantly between locations and seasons. Estimates of dispersal distances based on these results demonstrated that the initial dispersal of biodeposits produced by cultured mussels is not far. Depending on the hydrodynamic conditions, secondary dispersal via resuspension potentially plays a more important role in the dispersal of biodeposits from mussel farms than initial dispersal and almost certainly serves as the major means of transport of biodeposits from natural mussel beds.  Biodeposit mineralisation was studied by incubating coastal sediments with added biodeposits and measuring oxygen and nutrient fluxes as well as sediment characteristics over an 11 d period. Sediment oxygen consumption and ammonium release increased immediately after biodeposit addition and remained elevated compared to control cores without additions for the incubation period. A biodeposit decay rate (0.16 d-1) was calculated by fitting a first-order G model to the observed increase in oxygen consumption. This rate is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher than published decay rates of coastal sediments without organic enrichment or plant material. Nutrient fluxes during the incubation period illustrated that biodeposit remineralisation alters the stoichiometry of the nutrients released from the sediments which may potentially be more significant than the changes of the individual fluxes.  To determine the impact of a mussel farm in the Firth of Thames I measured sediment oxygen and nutrient fluxes by deploying benthic chambers, sediment characteristics by collecting sediment cores and sedimentation rates by deploying sediment traps in four seasons. Oxygen consumption and sediment nutrient release rates were generally higher under the farm compared to a reference site, demonstrating the typical response to increased organic input. Unusually low nitrogen release rates measured in summer may indicate enhanced denitrification under the farm. A simple budget demonstrated the importance of benthic nutrient regeneration in maintaining primary production in this region and that mussel culture can lead to a redistribution of nutrients. This study showed that site-specific hydrodynamic and biogeochemical conditions have to be taken into account when planning new mussel farms to prevent excessive modifications of nutrient dynamics.  Results of the laboratory and field studies conducted in this thesis were used to parameterise, calibrate and validate models of mussel biodeposit dispersal and remineralisation. A particle tracking model showed that the maximum initial dispersal of faecal pellets from the mussel farm is approximately 300 m and that pellets can be transported several times this distance via resuspension. The remineralisation model was able to simulate the increased nitrogen fluxes from the sediments well and highlighted the need for thorough calibration and parameterisation of the model. This thesis contributed to the current understanding of the ecosystem impacts of mussel culture and provided numerical models and model parameters that will assist in the assessment of mussel culture sustainability and the contribution of mussels to the nutrient cycling in nearshore ecosystems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">faeces</field><field name="subject">pseudofaeces</field><field name="subject">dispersal</field><field name="subject">remineralisation</field><field name="subject">benthic-pelagic coupling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation into the Determinants of Innovation in the New Zealand Biotechnology Sector</field><field name="creator">Marsh, Dan</field><field name="description">This thesis synthesises theoretical and empirical knowledge from four strands of the innovation literature and then uses this knowledge to develop a framework for analysing the determinants of innovation. The framework is tested on one part of the New Zealand economy - the biotechnology sector - an area of rapid technological change where innovation is of particular significance. Theoretical approaches to the economics of innovation and technological change are reviewed with particular reference to the neo-classical, endogenous growth, evolutionary and systems of innovation approaches. Alternative methods of measuring innovation output and innovation rate are also discussed. This is followed by a series of hypotheses regarding the determinants of innovation and a review of their place in the innovation literature. The thesis includes a detailed description of the New Zealand biotechnology sector based on a re-analysis of the first comprehensive (1998/99) survey of biotechnology in New Zealand, data from an original (2002) survey conducted by the author, data from interviews with senior management in a sample of biotechnology firms and a detailed review of secondary sources. This material is used in chapter 5 to address the question 'Does New Zealand have an innovation system for biotechnology?' Count data regression models and data from the 1998/99 and 2002 surveys are then used to test the framework's innovation hypotheses. Hypothesis testing focuses on the effects of several determinants (firm size, firm type, conduct of R, involvement in modern biotechnology, specialisation, and alliances) on innovation output and the innovation rate. Results relating to the effect of demand, technological opportunity and appropriability are also reported. The analysis in this thesis confirms the importance of most of the innovation determinants included in the framework. It also provides a detailed examination of the biotechnology sector and empirical insights into the innovation behaviour of biotech enterprises in New Zealand.  Prior to the analysis in this thesis, knowledge of the sector's parameters was very limited or absent.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Innovation</field><field name="subject">Biotechnology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Innovation System</field><field name="subject">Count Data</field><field name="subject">Alliances</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indigenous Psychology in Aotearoa: Realising  M&#257;ori Aspirations</field><field name="creator">Levy, Michelle Patricia</field><field name="description">Indigenous psychology in Aotearoa positions the aspirations of M&#257;ori as central.  The aim of this thesis is to describe and contribute to the development of a psychological discipline which is relevant and of benefit for M&#257;ori communities.  Part One sets the scene in Aotearoa, examining the relationship between M&#257;ori development and psychology.  Part Two explores the indigenous psychology literature base, identifying strategies which may be relevant to Aotearoa.  The key themes of context, critical mass, and mechanisms to support indigenous psychology development are identified as being relevant to Aotearoa.  Part Three explores indigenous psychology development in Aotearoa.  Data from a range of sources is qualitatively analysed to develop five themes which describe the current status of M&#257;ori development in psychology, the importance of the critical mass and the notion of collective responsibility.  Part Four, drawing from the analysis in Parts One, Two and Three, identifies 'reaching the point of irreversible change' as the next phase of indigenous psychology development in Aotearoa.  This is the point at which indigenous psychology development becomes self-sustaining.  The point at which irreversible change occurs is when: M&#257;ori knowledge bases are a legitimate part of psychology in Aotearoa; resistance to the legitimacy of M&#257;ori knowledge bases in psychology is not a characteristic of our landscape; environments supportive of indigenous psychology development are commonplace; and responsibility for contributing to indigenous psychology development is shared among and sustained by the collective capacity of the Leaders and Producers.  Consolidation, the process by which multiple and interrelated pathways are connected to form a unified whole, is fundamental to reaching the point of irreversible change.  An original interactional framework for consolidation is proposed.  This framework is based on two key consolidating mechanisms: a working description of Kaupapa M&#257;ori Psychologies; and a Kaupapa M&#257;ori Psychologies Research and Training Centre.  Psychologies relevant and of benefit to M&#257;ori communities which contribute to the realisation of M&#257;ori aspirations are the cornerstones, with all elements of the framework leading back into this fundamental foundation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">indigenous</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From the drawing board into schools: An analysis of the development and implementation of a new physics curriculum in New Zealand secondary schools</field><field name="creator">Fernandez, Teresa Sushama</field><field name="description">This thesis explored the introduction of a new physics curriculum in New Zealand secondary schools. It was part of a nationwide overhaul of the whole school curriculum from primary to secondary schools, initiated in the early 1990s. The study of curriculum change is inextricably woven with teacher change, as the teacher is seen as central to any real change in curricula in the classroom. Some theories of teacher change are reviewed here and synthesised into a list of criteria relevant to bringing about effective change in teachers and their practices. A sociocultural perspective emerged as being a useful theoretical approach in analysing and explaining these processes of curriculum change and teacher change because it takes a holistic approach that deals with 'people, places and things' and the discourses involved therein. In particular, Wenger's sociocultural theory was used to study the introduction of a new senior physics curriculum. His terms 'reification' and 'participation' were seen to apply to this research: the curriculum document was taken to be a reified communication artifact, and 'participation' is involved in every stage of its development and implementation. In the context of this theorising, data was procured from in-depth interviews with the three curriculum writers and ten physics teachers in and around a provincial city in New Zealand. The teachers were interviewed three times over a period of three years: before, during and after the first year of implementation; namely 1996 to 1998. The interviews showed that most of these ten physics teachers did not undergo any significant change in their teaching because of the introduction of 'Physics in the New Zealand Curriculum'. The reasons or barriers identified, such as lack of guidelines and clarity, and contentment with their own existing practice, were aligned with factors that have been identified by other researchers as important influences on teachers undergoing change, such as clarity of change and need for change. Three key elements were identified from these issues emerging from the data as necessary conditions or resources for teacher change: knowledge, support and time. In the present study, there was very limited knowledge held by the teachers about 'what', 'how' and 'why' changes were being implemented. Secondly, there was little social and system support for the curriculum change. Finally, teachers had little time to focus on and reflect on the change. A model of curriculum change, incorporating Wenger's notions of 'reification' and 'participation', but extended to include 'dereification' emerged from the data. 'Dereification' highlighted an important stage whereby the curriculum document as an artifact, needed to be incorporated into the plane of lived experiences of teachers. The introduction of the term 'dereification' supported the development of this model of curriculum change incorporating teacher change whereby the model outlined processes of reification and dereification involved in a mandated curriculum change. The model of curriculum change developed here also contained a screen that symbolises the lack of intersubjective linkage between teachers and the designers of the new curriculum. There was no follow-up teachers' guide, not enough explanation of the curriculum document, no direct communication between the writers and the teachers, and insufficient professional development for the teachers using it. The research findings led to three propositions: the curriculum document as a key artifact was not sufficient to effect a curriculum change; the lack of transparency of the curriculum document development was a constraint on teachers' commitment to the curriculum change; and the lack of support for teachers in their dereification of the curriculum document impacted negatively on curriculum change. The key elements of knowledge, support and time identified as crucial for teachers to effect any real change in their practice are critical at different points in the model of curriculum change. It is suggested that using such an interplay between the factors underlying teacher change and the sociocultural analysis of curriculum change, might enable more pro-active intervention at the various stages of the process of a curriculum change to effect a real change.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational Change</field><field name="subject">Physics Curriculum</field><field name="subject">Teacher Change</field><field name="subject">Sociocultural Theory</field><field name="subject">Mandated Curriculum Change</field><field name="subject">Curriculum Development</field><field name="subject">Curriculum Implementation</field><field name="subject">Curriculum Writers</field><field name="subject">Teachers - Attitudes and Beliefs</field><field name="subject">Communities of Practice</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Secondary Curriculum</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2551</field></doc><doc><field name="title">E hoki ki to maunga: The quintessential elements of home</field><field name="creator">Emery, Debra Joy Tepora</field><field name="description">He kopu puta tahi, he taura whiri t&#257;tou; whiringa a nuku, whiringa a rangi, te whatia e Issue of one womb, we are a rope woven of many strands; woven on earth, woven in heaven, it will not break (Rev M&#257;ori Marsden, 1992) Ngati Te Takinga is a hap&#363; (sub-tribe) belonging to the Iwi (tribe) Ngati Pikiao. An affiliated member of the Te Arawa confederation of tribes, Ngati Pikiao occupies the Okere and Rotoiti Lakes district of Rotorua in the central North Island of Aotearoa New Zealand. This thesis seeks to acknowledge and address the concerns that Ngati Te Takinga has regarding impending cultural discontinuity. The concerns arise due to the hap&#363;'s limited human capability and capacity being the result of three things. Firstly, the ongoing demise of tribal elders (and leaders) and the subsequent loss to the hap&#363; of cultural knowledge, skills, leadership and expertise. Secondly, the low numbers of adept, culturally proficient successors 'coming through' (to replace the elders) and finally, the detribalised and diasporic (dispersed) nature of our people. The hap&#363; and the marae Te Takinga (a last outwardly discernible bastion of Ngati Te Takinga cultural identity and distinction) are jeopardised as a result of these phenomenon. This thesis is part of a hap&#363; strategy that attempts to address these problems. Positing the reconnection of our dispersed Ngati Te Takinga 'away-dwellers' as a beginning solution, the central questions raised by this thesis are  how [does] Ngati Te Takinga 'home-dweller' discourse impact on the 'coming home' experiences and 'reconnection' of Ngati Te Takinga away-dwellers?  and  what are the [are there] implications for Ngati Te Takinga cultural continuity? The maintenance of Ngati Te Takinga cultural continuity forms the aho m&#257;tua or main thread of this work. Using narrative enquiry as a broad methodological framework,stories were gathered from four different groups of Ngati Te Takinga peoples. The groups were home-dwellers (mana whenua or ahi kaa), te ahi tere (away-dwellers who have returned home to live); te ahi tere (away-dwellers who intend returning in the future) and te ahi tere (away-dwellers who have no intention of returning home to live). The stories (narratives) investigated notions of home, belongingness and M&#257;ori identity in relation to the trichotomy of the connection, disconnection and the reconnection of Ngati Te Takinga peoples; the stories were analysed and co-constructed with participants for meaning. The stories showed that while the hap&#363; aspires to gather up the strengths of a dispersed people to reinvigorate our culture and the marae, existing and competing discourses around authenticity, authority and Ngati Te Takinga identity create a tension between the home (mana whenua/ahi kaa) and away-dwelling Ngati Te Takinga people; including those away-dwellers who have returned. As a basic requirement, this tension must be diminished in order to build the relationships necessary to improve hap&#363; allegiance (wh&#257;naungatanga), to build hap&#363; strength and to maintain hap&#363; culture and identity. As a priority, decolonising strategies that facilitate an understanding of diversity, promote participation, maintain tikanga and include our away-dwellers, our 'returnees' and/or our disconnected people in our hap&#363;-marae interactions, must be considered, developed, promoted and practiced.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hau kainga</field><field name="subject">home</field><field name="subject">belongingness</field><field name="subject">Maori identity</field><field name="subject">ahi kaa</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Improvement of Interfacial Bonding, Weathering and Recycling of Wood Fibre Reinforced Polypropylene Composites</field><field name="creator">Beg, Mohammad Dalour Hossen</field><field name="description">This study deals with medium density wood fibre (MDF) and Kraft fibre reinforced polypropylene (PP) composites produced using extrusion followed by injection moulding. Initially, composites were produced with MDF fibre using 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 wt% fibre, and 1, 2, 3 and 4 wt% maleated polypropylene (MAPP) as a coupling agent. A fibre content of 50 wt% with 3 wt% MAPP was found to be optimum. Alkali treatment of fibre was carried out to improve the interfacial bonding. After treatment, fibre surface charge was found to increase, but single fibre tensile strength (TS) and Young's modulus were (YM) decreased. Alkali treatment reduced composite TS but increased YM. The effects of hemicellulose and residual lignin content were assessed with Kraft fibre (subjected to different stages of a standard Kraft pulping process and therefore consisting of different hemicellulose and residual lignin contents). Fibre surface charge was found to increase with decreasing residual lignin content. Composites containing higher amounts of lignin lead to lower TS and lower thermal stability. Composites were subjected to accelerated weathering for 1000 hours. TS and YM were found to decrease during weathering, and the extent of reduction was found to be higher for composites with higher residual lignin. The reduction of mechanical properties was found to be due to degradation of lignin and PP chain scission as evaluated by increase in PP crystallinity after weathering. As low lignin (bleached) Kraft fibre composites were found to provide superior mechanical properties, as well as more stable during accelerated weathering, further study including optimisation of MAPP content, effects of fibre contents, fibre length, fibre beating, hygrothermal ageing and recycling were carried out with bleached Kraft fibre. MAPP contents of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10 wt% were used in Kraft fibre reinforced PP composites, and 3-5 wt% was found to be most favourable. Composite fibre content was varied between 30-50 wt%, and 40 wt% found to provide the maximum TS. To investigate the effects of fibre length on composites, fibre fractions of different length distribution were separated using a pressure screen. TS, YM and impact strength were found to decrease and failure strain (FS) increased with decreasing fibre length. To improve the interfacial bonding, the fibre was treated by mechanical beater. Fibre beating increased the TS of composites up to a certain point, beyond which TS decreased. Hygothermal ageing of composites was carried out by immersing specimens in distilled water at 30, 50 and 70 C over an 8-month period. Equilibrium moisture content and diffusion coefficient increased with increased fibre content in composites as well as with increased immersion temperature. Composites without coupling agent showed higher water uptake and diffusion coefficient than that of with coupling agent. After hygrothermal ageing the TS and YM decreased but FS and impact strength were found to increase. An investigation into the effects of recycling was carried out with composites containing either 40 wt% or 50 wt% fibre (bleached Kraft) with 4 wt% MAPP, and recycled up to eight times. For composites with 40 wt% fibre, TS and YM were found to decrease with increased recycling by up to 25% for TS and 17% for YM (after being recycled 8 times). Although TS was lower for virgin composites with 50 wt% fibre than for those with 40 wt% fibre, this initially increased with recycling by up to 14% (after being recycled 2 times), which was considered to be due to improved fibre dispersion, but then decreased with further recycling, and an overall 11% reduction of TS was found after recycling 8 times compared to the virgin composites. YM was higher for virgin composites with 50 wt% fibre than those with for 40 wt% fibre, and also initially increased with recycling but decreased upon further recycling. Recycling was found to increase thermal stability. The TS of composites made by combining recycled with virgin materials was also assessed. Hygrothermal ageing behaviour of recycled composites was also investigated by immersing specimens in distilled water at 50 C over a 9 month period. It was found that the diffusion coefficient and the equilibrium moisture contents of composites decreased with increased number of times the materials were recycled. After hygrothermal ageing, TS and YM of composites were found to decrease. However, the extent of reduction was found to decrease with increased recycling.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wood fibre composites</field><field name="subject">Recycling</field><field name="subject">Weathering</field><field name="subject">Coupling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2553</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regional Tourism Organisations in New Zealand from 1980 to 2005: Process of Transition and Change</field><field name="creator">Zahra, Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis is a historical case study tracing the establishment and evolution of Regional Tourism Organisations (RTOs) in New Zealand. It describes their role, structure and functions and the political processes that have influenced how they have operated and changed from 1980 to 2005. RTOs are examined in the context of government policies, local and national politics and tourism private and public sector relationships. RTOs were central to many of the key recommendations of the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2010 (NZTS 2010) released in 2001. The NZTS 2010 attempted to address a range of tourism policy gaps created by a policy vacuum in the 1990s whereby the public and private tourism sectors focused mainly on international marketing. This strategy shaped government policy during this decade. The research findings show that although public and private sector institutional arrangements impacting on RTOs have changed, there remains, as in the past, no uniformity in their role, structure, functions and their future financial and political viability remains insecure. The NZTS 2010 raised destination management and its alignment with destination marketing as a major policy issue that needed to be addressed in the decade leading up to 2010 with RTOs having a pivotal role. A generic regional destination management model is presented. Structures and processes incorporated into this model include: a national destination management tourism policy; support for tourism by local government at the national level; a well defined destination management team; community collaboration; and tourism being integrated into the wider planning processes of local government. The model identified requisite building blocks to support regional destination management such as: the provision of staff and financial resources for regional tourism; the building of a high tourism profile in the community; the availability of statistics and research data at the regional level; local government planners acknowledging the impacts of tourism; and the existence of a legal mandate for tourism at the regional and/or local government level. When applying this model to the New Zealand context, it was found that a number of the structures and processes required for effective regional destination management were lacking, such as regional statistics and research data, staffing and financial resources for both RTOs and local government, the ability of council planners to understand and integrate tourism into the wider planning processes and a legislative mandate for tourism. The thesis concluded that a vacuum remains in the alignment of destination marketing and management.  The historical and political processes of RTO change were also examined in the context of chaos and complexity theory. Chaos and complexity theory provided a complementary and different means to view change. This thesis also presented the opportunity to reflect upon the research process which led to the adoption of a multi-paradigmatic and bricoleur research methodology. Further reflexivity and reflection towards the end of the research process articulated ontological and epistemological philosophical investigations that underlay the multi-paradigmatic approach. A model is presented emphasising that a multi-paradigmatic research approach rests on ultimate reality (metaphysics) which informs the ontology. The model then highlights that ontology precedes and directs epistemology and that both inform the multi-paradigmatic research framework.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Regional Tourism Organisations</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">tourism policy</field><field name="subject">destination management</field><field name="subject">destination marketing</field><field name="subject">local government</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">multi-paradigmatic</field><field name="subject">chaos and complexty theory. ontology</field><field name="subject">epistemology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Determinants of Customer Perceptions in a Dynamic Business Environment: An Exploratory Analysis of the ASP Business Model</field><field name="creator">Liang, Yan-Mei (AMY)</field><field name="description">Outsourcing attracted much attention in 1989 when Kodak outsourced its data center operation to IBM (International Business Machines Corp.).  Nowadays, this strategy has become more popular.  At the beginning of this century, the ASP (Application Service Provider) model was considered one of the typical solutions of Internet-based IT (Information Technology) outsourcing.  Although this model has been transformed and renamed (e.g. SaaS - Software as a Service), the principle concept of providing IT service through the Internet or wide area network is still there. This study attempts to explore the determinants of customer perception of Internet-based IT outsourcing by obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the ASP model. The research dimensions not only include factors affecting users' perception of service quality but also ASP business position (i.e. the firm origin of ASP and its provider type) and services utilized by the customers.  Through the study of firm history, two important theoretical themes of this research - path-dependence and Ansoff's product/ market growth matrix - are taken account of in exploring the influence of the determinants. Web-based questionnaire survey research is conducted together with a documentation study to collect data.  Targeting the customers of the top 50 ASPs selected by ASPnews.com during the period 2001-2004, the researcher contacted 597 potential respondents, and 196 responses were returned.  The valid sample consisted of 175 responses, and 124 of them not only provided full information for satisfaction evaluation but also the information for tracking their ASP vendors' business position. The GLM (General Linear Model) and the Pearson correlation coefficient were the major statistical approaches used to evaluate the survey data for developing a structural model.  The research findings indicated that the factors associated with service competitiveness, such as capability and performance, reliability and trustworthiness, affordability, integration and customization, have positive effects on customer perceived satisfaction; whereas lock-in has a negative effect.  More specifically, the origin of the ASP firm has a direct effect on capacity and performance, and also directly influences the use of IT adoption services.  Based on this finding, a descriptive analysis and qualitative research shows that two mechanisms for path-dependence - existing expertise and perceived expertise - can affect the satisfaction level of capacity and performance of ASP services.  On the other hand, provider type has a direct effect on affordability and also directly influences the use of facility supporting services.  On this basis, another two mechanisms for path-dependence - transaction cost and standardization - can indirectly impact customer's perception of this business model via affordability.  In addition to those major findings, some other determinants (e.g. software applications, brand of applications, and intensity of service used) were also identified in this study. The study result can be used for theoretical understanding about the determinants of ASP customer's perception.  It not only indicates a new perspective to enhance the current body of research on this topic, but can also be more broadly applied to any fast-growth firm, rapid-change business, or technology intensive industry.

A survey method with a selfadministered questionnaire was used and a cross-section of the Muslim male population of New Zealand was taken. The qualitative interviews and email questionnaires were also utilised to further explain the survey results. The linear regression analyses show correlations between contextual aspects (i.e., social, religious, economic, political, and demographic) and EEB (pre-cycling, re-use and recycling). Results indicate that the contextual aspects are influential on EEB in many ways and degrees. A model describing the relationship was developed. The economic aspect statistically significantly related to EEB the strongest. The qualitative interview and email questionnaire data support the findings of the survey. The relationship was positive, meaning that the more the consumers were influenced by the economic aspect to behave in an environmentally ethical way, the more they were likely to perform EEB. Compared to the economic aspect, white collar workers, number of household occupant, work involvement with the environment, type of house, and age had a weaker statistically significant relationship with EEB. The relationships were positive, meaning that the better the consumers' occupation (i.e., white collar workers), the more household member they had (i.e., 4 and above), the higher their level of work involvement with the environment, and the better their dwelling (i.e., bungalow or semi-detached houses), the more they were likely to perform EEB. However, the relationship between age and EEB was negative, meaning that the younger the consumers the more they were likely to perform EEB. However, the results of this study, from both the survey and the interview methods, indicate that demographic characteristics were not as important as the contextual aspects, particularly the economic aspect, in understanding consumers' EEB. This study shows that the economic aspect was very important in understanding consumers' EEB compared to the other contextual aspects even the political aspect was statistically significantly related to EEB via the economic aspect. Thus, the economic aspect should be used optimally by public and private sector managers to promote EEB.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmentally ethical behaviour (EEB)</field><field name="subject">environmentally ethical behavior (EEB)</field><field name="subject">household waste</field><field name="subject">household purchasing</field><field name="subject">solid waste</field><field name="subject">pre-cycling</field><field name="subject">recycling</field><field name="subject">reusing</field><field name="subject">contextual aspects</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Muslim</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te Papa-o-Rotu Marae Management and Administration at the End of the Twentieth Century: Negotiating Bureaucratisation</field><field name="creator">Collins, Adelaide</field><field name="description">Te Papa-o-Rotu Marae is a M&#257;ori community settlement located in the Waikato region of New Zealand. Its hapu (sub-tribe) community was one of 33 hapu that formed the Tainui confederation claiming compensation from the Crown for land confiscated in the nineteenth century.  The claim was settled in 1995 and it was within this context that research for this study was conducted at the marae from August 1997 to December 1999.  This ethnographic study examines the way that the community at Te Papa-o-Rotu Marae managed its affairs through its two management bodies, the Marae Committee and the Trustees.  It is argued in this thesis that the marae's mode of management is in transition from an informal to formal mode, and from an inward to outward looking focus.  Bureaucratic administration, it is argued, has been the major catalyst for the transition and has been introduced into marae operations through an accumulation of state legislation affecting M&#257;ori land and communities. Furthermore, some aspects of bureaucratic administration have been legitimated and appropriated by the iwi authority, which has passed this on to the Marae Committee.  The community have been complicit in the adoption of bureaucratic administration by accommodating the requirements of both the state and the iwi authority.  However, a persistent question was whether the marae could maintain its own rangatiratanga (authority, self-determination, control) and separate identity in the face of increasing pressure to conform to a bureaucratic management style.  The community managed the marae communally by way of hui (gatherings) and meetings, which were observed using a combined methodological approach of Kaupapa M&#257;ori research and ethnography, as described in Chapter 2.  The philosophy of kotahitanga (solidarity) underpinned the social organisation of the Tainui tribal confederation, so understanding the place of the marae in its wider socio-political environment has helped in comprehending the nature of the pressure on the community to increase its scale of operations and is explained in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 introduces the accumulation of influences that have brought about a change of managerial style from informal to formal organising.  The practical effect of these influences are demonstrated in the management structure and administrative systems that the community used. These are described phenomenologically in Chapters 5 and 6 respectively.  The management plan, compiled since 1995, had a strong emphasis on management structural review and participation in tribal development initiatives and is discussed in Chapter 7. The implementation of a collaborative development project between the iwi authority and Marae Committee is described in Chapter 8.  The final chapter reflects on the impact of bureaucratic administration on marae management as well as the dynamism of the community and how the rangatiratanga of the marae has thus far been maintained.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">informal organising</field><field name="subject">marae</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">indigenous organising</field><field name="subject">Maori social organisation</field><field name="subject">kaupapa Maori research</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2557</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrogen Isotope Variation in the Environment:  Implications for Interpretation</field><field name="creator">Tozer, Wade Colin</field><field name="description">Natural abundance of 15N varies greatly and unpredictably within and between environments.  The unpredictable nature of 15N limits the use of N isotope natural abundance (d15N) in tracing the flow and fate of N in environments.  Recent investigations have, however, revealed consistent and repeatable patterns of 15N in some ecosystem components.  These patterns suggest that d15N may yet provide a tool to investigate and illuminate ecosystem N cycling processes.  Identifying and quantifying the sources of isotopic variation must precede any significant advance in the application of this technique, and to this end an assessment of isotopic variation associated with major ecosystem components has been carried out in this thesis.  d15N patterns have been established, hypotheses proposed and tested, and conclusions about the application of the technique are presented.  15N patterns in surface and groundwater were measured in a variety of different land-use catchments in an attempt to identify distinct isotopic 'fingerprints'.  High levels of 15N variation were measured in both stream and groundwaters, resulting in strongly overlapping land-use 'fingerprints'.  Environmental 15N variation in streams and groundwaters was found to be too great to differentiate between land-uses based on d15N alone.  In contrast, the artificially 15N enriched signature of effluent N was used to trace its flow and fate, following irrigation, in a forested catchment.  The effluent d15N signature allowed it to be traced into the major ecosystem components, permitting a first order N budget to be determined for effluent N storage and loss.  N sources with significantly different 15N signatures to that of 'background ecosystem N' can therefore be used to trace the flow and fate of N in ecosystems.  During the course of this work a number of higher and lower order plants were observed to have highly depleted (lt; -8 ) d15N signatures.  Epiphytes and lithophytes, strongly reliant on atmospheric N sources, were consistently depleted in 15N, with signatures as low as -24 , measured in a range of environments.  A similar level of depletion was measured in a wide range of plants growing in early primary succession sites (as low as -22.3 ), which could not be accounted for by any abiotic or biotic factor or significantly depleted N source.  The absence of any measurable driver of depletion suggested a universal fractionating mechanism which acts in a wide range of environments and vegetation types.  Diffusive uptake of atmospheric NH3(g) and the proportional uptake of a supplied N source were two proposed mechanisms that could theoretically account for the level and universal nature of depletion. Diffusive uptake of atmospheric NH3(g) was tested as a primary fractionating mechanism in plants.  Strongly N deficient plants were capable of utilising NH3(g) as a nutritional source, but the level of 15N depletion measured in these plants closely approximated that of the inherent NH3(g) d15N signature.  No significant additional fractionation is associated with NH3(g) diffusive uptake.  Diffusive uptake of atmospheric NH3(g) by plants cannot alone account for the level of depletion measured in early primary succession plant communities. Proportional uptake of a N source as a primary fractionating mechanism was tested by growing plants in various concentrations and rates of applied N.  Fractionation attributed to the proportional uptake of a supplied N source, as a consequence of P limitation or rapid flow over roots, resulted in a significant level of 15N depletion in plants. The level of depletion attributed to this mechanism was, however, not sufficient to account for the level measured in early primary succession plant communities.  Individual 15N fractionating mechanisms cannot alone explain the level of depletion observed in early primary succession plants, however a combination of fractionating mechanisms can.  Fractionation attributed to the proportional uptake of an already depleted N source, i.e., wet deposited N, largely accounts for the level of depletion measured in early succession plant communities.  This two-step fractionation model can act on both higher and lower plants, independent of ecosystem biotic and abiotic factors.  Additional, and less dramatic fractionations attributed to atmospheric NH3(g) uptake, mycorrhizal associations, internal remobilisation, and taxon-specific N acquisition strategies, will contribute to the level of d15N depletion.  This thesis presents the first extensive survey of highly depleted d15N signatures in terrestrial vegetation.  Furthermore, thorough testing of theoretically plausible mechanisms has resulted in a full account of the highly depleted d15N signatures measured in a wide range of vegetation types and environments.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">d15N</field><field name="subject">natural abundance</field><field name="subject">15N tracer</field><field name="subject">effluent</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">ecosystem</field><field name="subject">N cycling processes</field><field name="subject">land-use</field><field name="subject">primary succession</field><field name="subject">ammonia</field><field name="subject">lithophytes</field><field name="subject">plant</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Images of Pakeha-M&#257;ori: A Study of the Representation of Pakeha-M&#257;ori by Historians of New Zealand From Arthur Thomson (1859) to James Belich (1996)</field><field name="creator">Bentley, Trevor William</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates how Pakeha-M&#257;ori have been represented in New Zealand non-fiction writing during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The chronological and textual boundaries range from Arthur Thomson's seminal history The Story of New Zealand (1859) to James Belich's Making Peoples (1996). It examines the discursive inventions and reinventions of Pakeha-M&#257;ori from the stereotypical images of the Victorian era to modern times when the contact zone has become a subject of critical investigation and a sign of changing intellectual dynamics in New Zealand and elsewhere.  This thesis is about the history of attitudes to culture-crossers in New Zealand, the use of the term 'Pakeha-M&#257;ori', and the images that underlie the thinking of Britons and Pakeha about them. It explores the motives and backgrounds of specific authors and the ways in which they frame New Zealand history. It elucidates the ambiguous and contradictory perspectives of Pakeha-M&#257;ori in the literature and analyses its impact on changing public perceptions about them. The study critiques the literature with emphasis on theoretically informed research, historical analysis, and literary insights. Discussion is confined to published texts, with the aim of exploring the multiplicity of Pakeha-M&#257;ori images and the processes that gave rise to them.  This study is essentially an investigation into how and why historians and other scholars try to draw boundaries between cultures in order to create a satisfactory metanarrative or myth of the 'settlement' of New Zealand and thus to forge a sense of New Zealandness. The cultural and racial categories of 'M&#257;ori' and 'Pakeha' are very unstable, however, and a consideration of the 'in-between' or 'culture-crossing' category of 'Pakeha-M&#257;ori' can reveal the way in which 'M&#257;ori' and 'Pakeha' and a sense of New Zealand and New Zealanders have been constructed. More particularly, consideration of representations of those culture-crossers or race-crossers called Pakeha-M&#257;ori can reveal the hopes and fears of Pakeha writers regarding Pakeha, M&#257;ori and New Zealand and how Pakeha-M&#257;ori have frequently been a barometer or litmus test of public perceptions of relations between M&#257;ori and Pakeha in different historical periods.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pakeha-Maori</field><field name="subject">acculturation</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">social class</field><field name="subject">culture-crossing</field><field name="subject">adaptation</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">cultural boundaries</field><field name="subject">hybridity</field><field name="subject">New Zealand literature</field><field name="subject">New Zealand history</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Maori culture</field><field name="subject">racial stereotypes</field><field name="subject">images</field><field name="subject">representation</field><field name="subject">non fiction.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Healing Pluralism and Responsibility: An Anthropological Study of Patient and Practitioner Beliefs</field><field name="creator">Miskelly, Philippa Ann</field><field name="description">Combining the use of alternative and complementary therapies and orthodox medicine is an increasing phenomenon.  This thesis examines the implications of mixing and matching plural healing modalities against a backdrop of patient and practitioner responsibilities.   From an anthropological perspective, the predominant use of qualitative methodology is an integral part of this research project.  Central to this study is the views of a variety of participant categories - patients who use both alternative and orthodox healing methods; non-medical alternative and complementary practitioners; medical doctors who integrate orthodox and CAM therapies into their daily practise; and orthodox general practitioners.  Interviews with these participants took place over an eighteen-month timeframe and involved face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, and focus group research.   Social constructionist theory, which forms part of the compendium of interpretive theoretical approaches adopted under the medical anthropology paradigm, has been used in order to expose the beliefs patients and practitioners hold about their own responsibilities, and those of the other participant categories.  This study reveals a palimpsest of complex, contradictory and competing discourses in relation to patient and practitioner expectations and responsibilities.  One important finding relates to the significance of neo-liberal and individualistic ideologies. This thesis concludes that the rhetoric from complementary and alternative practitioners, and their integrative colleagues, is heavily imbued with ideas about self-responsibility, particularly in relation to patient lifestyle choices and therapeutic compliance.   Patients and orthodox general practitioners share some of these views but in general adopt a more collective approach to health care responsibilities.  While patients are prepared to accept some responsibility for their illnesses and health keeping practises, they express strong reliance towards the orthodox health model as well as those doctors who practise integrative medicine.   However the same cannot be said of their attitudes towards CAM modalities where considerable ambivalence is evident towards both practitioners and the therapies themselves.   The role of the state, and its responsibilities for the structure of the health care system in New Zealand, is also clearly influential in the construction of belief systems.  This is especially so because the rhetoric underlying neo-liberal and individualistic discourses now permeates the direction of health policies.   Increasing levels of surveillance, both at bureaucratic and individual levels, also attests to the influence of neo-liberalism and individualism.    This study exposes the tensions between the rhetoric of self-responsibility and the lived experiences of patients and health practitioners, which in many cases is more collective in its focus than is initially apparent.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical pluralism</field><field name="subject">alternative medicine</field><field name="subject">complementary medicine</field><field name="subject">orthodox medicine</field><field name="subject">responsibility</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2560</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genealogical Family History in Aotearoa-New Zealand: From Community of Practice to Transdisciplinary Academic Discourse?</field><field name="creator">Brown, Margaret Mary Selman</field><field name="description">Genealogical Family Historians conduct research in order to reconstruct genealogical families, through the application of a rigorous methodology: weighing the evidence for placing each individual in a family group, linking family groups of the past and making contact with kin of the present. Genealogical Family Historians trace the movements and migrations of identified individuals and family groups; and study the local, national and international social settings of lives lived in families and households in different times and places, over many generations. A large worldwide Community of Practice with many constituent groups, including the New Zealand Society of Genealogists Incorporated, has formed itself around this research activity. In this transdisciplinary study focused on social learning, I have explored and analysed the domain, the practice and the community of Genealogical Family Historians researching in and from Aotearoa-New Zealand during the past 50 years. Genealogical Family Historians meet formally and informally, in small groups or at large conferences to pursue their self-directed learning. The collaborative practice includes publishing and teaching; and the locating, preserving and indexing of records. Many conduct research and communicate with others in the new world of cyberspace. My overarching research question has been: where is the future place for this scholarly discourse? My approach to this study is transdisciplinary: my point-of-view is above and across departments and disciplines. The ethos and vision of transdisciplinarity is attained only through existing disciplines, and transdisciplinary research has the potential to contribute to those disciplines, as I demonstrate in this thesis. The transdisciplinary scholarly discourse of Genealogical Family History owes much to the disciplines of history, geography and sociology; and draws on biology, law, religious studies, linguistics, demography, computer science and information technology. I have also drawn on understandings from my own prior and concurrent disciplinary knowledge and experience for this study. Other Genealogical Family Historians bring different disciplinary understandings to the discourse that is Genealogical Family History. My positionality is that of an insider, an involved member of the Community of Practice for many years. In this study, I have allowed my key informants to speak with their own voices; and I have sought illustration and evidence from documentation and observation in the wider Genealogical Family History Community, past and present. I have used enhanced reflection on my own practice in my analysis and in case studies. This study demonstrates how the Community of Practice has played an important role in developing a transdisciplinary mode of inquiry and suggests that there are some generic features of the field and practice of Genealogical Family History that form the substance of a transdisciplinary discourse ready to take its place in academia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genealogical family history</field><field name="subject">community of practice</field><field name="subject">transdisciplinary discourse</field><field name="subject">family reconstitution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2561</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Random Relational Rules</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Grant</field><field name="description">In the field of machine learning, methods for learning from single-table data have received much more attention than those for learning from multi-table, or relational data, which are generally more computationally complex. However, a significant amount of the world's data is relational. This indicates a need for algorithms that can operate efficiently on relational data and exploit the larger body of work produced in the area of single-table techniques. This thesis presents algorithms for learning from relational data that mitigate, to some extent, the complexity normally associated with such learning. All algorithms in this thesis are based on the generation of random relational rules. The assumption is that random rules enable efficient and effective relational learning, and this thesis presents evidence that this is indeed the case. To this end, a system for generating random relational rules is described, and algorithms using these rules are evaluated. These algorithms include direct classification, classification by propositionalisation, clustering, semi-supervised learning and generating random forests. The experimental results show that these algorithms perform competitively with previously published results for the datasets used, while often exhibiting lower runtime than other tested systems. This demonstrates that sufficient information for classification and clustering is retained in the rule generation process and that learning with random rules is efficient. Further applications of random rules are investigated. Propositionalisation allows single-table algorithms for classification and clustering to be applied to the resulting data, reducing the amount of relational processing required. Further results show that techniques for utilising additional unlabeled training data improve accuracy of classification in the semi-supervised setting. The thesis also develops a novel algorithm for building random forests by making efficient use of random rules to generate trees and leaves in parallel.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relational data mining</field><field name="subject">random relational rules</field><field name="subject">propositionalisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fungal Diversity and Cellulytic Activity in the Historic Huts, Ross Island, Antarctica</field><field name="creator">Duncan, Shona Margaret</field><field name="description">The goal of this study was to undertake a microbial investigation of the Historic Huts areas on Ross Island, to gain knowledge of the fungal biodiversity and biochemical framework, focusing on the wood degrading potential of these fungi at both psychrophilic (cold) and mesophilic (moderate) temperatures. Eight hundred and forty nine samples were collected from three Heroic Era Historic Huts of Antarctica, from a variety of substrates but predominantly structural wood. The huts, Discovery Hut at Hut Point, Terra Nova Hut at Cape Evans and Nimrod Hut at Cape Royds, are located on Ross Island and were all assembled in the early 20th century by the Heroic Era explorers to house the expeditions, stores and animals. These wooden huts were abandoned when the expeditions left. The introduction of wood and other organic material to a pristine environment along with the creation of a microclimate within the harsh Antarctica environment created interesting sites for studying fungal diversity, wood decay and fungal cellulase enzymes in an extreme environment. Each hut can be classified as offering different conditions and circumstances for fungal propagules. Of the three huts, Terra Nova Hut is the only hut where there are visible fungal blooms within the hut and it, with Discovery Hut, had the greatest number of samples that contained fungi compared to Nimrod Hut which had the least. Discovery Hut, at less than 500 metres from the United States McMurdo Station, is the most visited by scientist and base staff and has been the most demonstrably affected by human impact of the three huts due to its closeness to the research stations on Ross Island To ensure a full understanding of the fungal diversity of the Historic Hut sites, a variety of sampling techniques were used along with a variety of culture media. Two thousand and seventy six isolates consisting of 1177 filamentous fungi and 899 single celled microorganisms (yeast and bacteria) were isolated; all these cultures were frozen and now form the University of Waikato Antarctic Culture Collection. Five genera dominated the fungal isolates that were identified and these were Cladosporium, Geomyces, Cadophora, Penicillium and Thelebolus. The fungal diversity of these Historic Huts' communities is low but the members present are metabolically active, consistent with other microbial communities in the Antarctic. The Historic Huts and surroundings contain a diverse array of provision in the way of wood and supplies, which provide nutrient sources for fungal growth. Endemic organisms present in the soil could have been enriched by using the introduced nutrient sources as primary and/or second metabolic substrates. In addition, fungi could have been introduced with the wooden huts and supplies when they were brought to Antarctica by the Heroic Era explorers, or introduced in the subsequent years with visitors and conservation work conducted at the sites. These introduced organisms, though, would have had to adapt to the change in climate and conditions posed by the Antarctic in order to survive and be subsequently isolated in this study. A screen for carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) activity was done on a selection of the fungal isolates as the first step to understand the cellulytic potential of the Antarctica fungal community inhabiting the huts. One hundred and six fungal isolates from a total of 404, that were screened were deemed to be CMCase positive, 27 fungal isolates were chosen for further study including quantifying the activity of extracellular endo-1,4-&#946;-glucanase at psychrophilic and mesophilic incubation temperatures. All but one isolate could produce endo-1,4-&#946;-glucanase activity at 4 C and many produced more endo-1,4-&#946;-glucanase activity at 4 C than at 15 C. Cadophora malorum 182, Cadophora malorum 242, Penicillium roquefortii 405, Penicillium roquefortii 408, Geomyces sp. 711, Geomyces sp. 824 and Cladosporium oxysporium 805 were selected for in-depth study of growth characteristics including growth temperature preferences, growth on a variety of cellulose substrates, water activity, and carbon sources, the latter done by using a commercially available microtitre plate containing 95 carbon sources. All seven of the fungal isolates were classified as psychrotolerant and produced, when cultured at either 4 C or at 15 C, cellulase, protease, amylase, xylanase, and pectinase and mannanase enzyme activities. The range of water activity that the Antarctic Penicillium roquefortii isolates could grow at was distinctive when compared with food Penicillium roquefortii isolates. The utilisation of different carbon sources showed that like many studies of Antarctica organism they have a diverse range of enzymatic activity, but interestingly the activity does not differ greatly with incubation temperature with most carbon sources being used or not used at both incubation temperatures tested. Although it took longer for the fungi to grow at the psychrophilic temperatures, the range of carbon sources they utilised was not reduced. The protein composition of the extracellular supernatants was visualised using various electrophoretic and staining techniques. The cellulase activity of the protein bands was visualised by cellulose-containing zymograms, which illustrated that the cellulase complex in all fungi tested was multi-enzyme and differed between species, isolates and temperatures of culturing. The cellulase activity of Cadophora malorum 182 was enriched by purification techniques including ion exchange chromatography and native preparative electrophoresis. The protein complex was not purified to homogeneity, but enriched for a mixture of proteins and the mixture was described as having the following properties; a temperature range of &#946;-1,4-glucan cellobiohydrolase activity from 20 C to 80 C with the optimum activity seen at 60 C, &#946;-1,4-glucan cellobiohydrolase activity that is stable at 4, 25 and 40 C for at least 24 hrs, lost at 50  C and 80 C within 24 hrs and 2 minutes respectively. Along with &#946;-1,4-glucan cellobiohydrolase activity, the protein mixture contained Avicelase, CMCase, xylanase and mannanase activity. The thesis research showed that there was limited fungal diversity in the Historic Huts and artefacts (a total of five dominant genera were identified) but the fungi are actively growing and producing viable spores in the cold of Antarctica and producing the necessary enzymes for degradation of wood. Although the metabolism and growth rate is slower at psychrophilic temperatures, the fungal isolates studied as part of this thesis research could still function enzymatically at cold temperatures and this includes the degradation of wood as evidenced by in vitro wood decay studies examined by scanning electron microscopy where two isolates of one species demonstrated the ability to degrade wood. The cellulase complex of the investigated fungal isolate was multi-enzymed and although the components were not purified to homogeneity, an enriched mixture of proteins had enzyme activity and stability in a broad temperature range, and activity to a variety of cellulosic substrates. This thesis research adds to the knowledge of the fungal biodiversity in the Antarctic and increases the understanding of the biochemical framework, participating in relation to wood decay potential of these Antarctic fungal isolates.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fungal Biodiversity</field><field name="subject">Historic Huts</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">Growth Characteristics</field><field name="subject">Cellulase</field><field name="subject">Wood Decay.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2563</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"There is evil there that does not sleep": The construction of evil in American popular cinema from 1989 to 2002</field><field name="creator">Bather, Neil Edward</field><field name="description">In The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Boromir refers to the lands of Mordor as the place where evil never sleeps. Cinematic evil itself never sleeps, always arising in new forms, to the extent that there exist as many types of evil as there are films. This thesis examines this constantly shifting construction of evil in American popular cinema between 1989 and 2002 - roughly, the period between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the attack on the World Trade Center - and how this cinema engaged with representations of enemies and of evil per se. The thesis uses content and thematic analysis on a sample of the 201 most successful films at the U.S. box office during the period. In these films, cinematic evil is constructed according to a visual aesthetic that attempts to engage with societal values, but fails to do so due to the emphasis on its visual construction and its commodification. As Baudrillard argues, evil has become a hollow concept devoid of meaning, and this is especially so for cinematic evil. It is recognised, and is recognisable, by the visual excessiveness of its violence (or potentiality for violence), and by certain codes that are created in reference to intertextual patterns and in relationship to discourses of paranoia and malaise. But cinema in this period failed to engage with the concept of evil itself in any meaningful way. Cinematic evil mirrors the descent into the chaos and disorder of a postmodern society. All cinematic evil can do is to connect with this sense of unease in which the 'reality of evil' cannot be represented. Instead, it draws on earlier icons and narratives of evil in a conflation of narrative and spectacle that produces a cinema of nostalgia. Moreover, stripped of narrative causality, these films express a belief, unproved and unprovable, that evil things and evil people may arise in any form, in any place and at any time: a cinema of paranoia. Together, these factors produce a cinema of malaise, perpetually confronting an evil it is unable to define or locate.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hollywood cinema</field><field name="subject">film</field><field name="subject">evil</field><field name="subject">Hollywood</field><field name="subject">film industry</field><field name="subject">commercial cinema</field><field name="subject">commercial film</field><field name="subject">evil in film</field><field name="subject">evil in cinema</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2564</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Repositioning within indigenous discourses of transformation and self-determination</field><field name="creator">Berryman, Mere</field><field name="description">This thesis reflectively and critically examines a series of research case studies initiated by a research-wh&#257;nau. It explores the thinking, experiences and reflections of this research-wh&#257;nau, as they worked to enhance the educational achievement of M&#257;ori students. Authorship of the thesis was undertaken by me (Mere Berryman). However, the methodology involved a collaborative, retrospective and critical reflection of research-wh&#257;nau experiences and thinking, in the light of the research findings and experiences since the inception of this research-wh&#257;nau in 1991. In the course of this work, the research-wh&#257;nau have been able to explore what it has meant to put the principles of kaupapa M&#257;ori research into practice while working within a mainstream organisation (Specialist Education Services then the Ministry of Education). Our research work has involved repositioning ourselves from dependence on Western research methodologies to a better understanding and application of kaupapa M&#257;ori conceptualisations of research. The thesis begins by identifying mainstream and kaupapa M&#257;ori events that have historically and still continue to impact upon M&#257;ori students' educational experiences. These events provide the wider context for the work of this research-wh&#257;nau at the interface of Te Ao M&#257;ori and Te Ao P&#257;keh&#257;, and for the 11 case studies that exemplify changes in our thinking and research practice over a period of 15 years. The thesis employs an indigenous (and specifically M&#257;ori) worldview as the framework for description, critical reflection, and theorising around these case studies. Common themes are collaboratively co-constructed then each theme is explained in relation to relevant M&#257;ori theory. The thesis concludes with the shifts in theorising and practice made by the research-wh&#257;nau during the course of our work as we sought to contribute in ways that were more transformative and self-determining. We argue that these shifts in theorising and practice are also required of others if we are to change the status quo and contribute constructively to improving M&#257;ori students' potential.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">research-whanau</field><field name="subject">indigenous</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">repositioning</field><field name="subject">discourses</field><field name="subject">transformation</field><field name="subject">self-determination</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2565</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Creative Process: The Effects of Domain Specific Knowledge and Creative Thinking Techniques on Creativity</field><field name="creator">Kilgour, A.Mark</field><field name="description">As we move further into the 21st century there are few processes that are more important for us to understand than the creative process. The aim of this thesis is to assist in deepening that understanding. To achieve this a review of the literature is first undertaken. Combining the many different streams of research from the literature results in the development of a four-stage model of the creative thinking process. The four stages are problem definition, idea generation, internal evaluation, and idea expression. While a large range of factors influence the various stages in this model, two factors are identified for further analysis as their effect on creativity is unclear. These two factors are domain-specific knowledge and creative thinking techniques. The first of these factors relates to the first stage of the creative thinking process (problem definition), specifically the extent to which informational cues prime domain specific knowledge that then sets the starting point for the creative combination process. The second factor relates to stage two of the model (idea generation), and the proposition by some researchers and practitioners that creative output can be significantly improved through the use of techniques. While the semantics of these techniques differ, fundamentally all techniques encourage the use of divergent thinking by providing remote associative cues as the basis for idea generation. These creative thinking techniques appear to result in the opening of unusual memory categories to be used in the creative combination process. These two potential influences on the creative outcomes of individuals: 1) domain specific knowledge, and 2) creative thinking techniques, form the basis for an experimental design. Qualitative and quantitative research is undertaken at two of the world's leading advertising agencies, and with two student samples, to identify how creative thinking techniques and domain-specific knowledge, when primed, influence creative outcomes. In order to measure these effects a creative thinking measurement instrument is developed. Results found that both domain-specific knowledge and creative thinking techniques are key influences on creative outcomes. More importantly, results also found interaction effects that significantly extend our current understanding of the effects of both primed domain-specific knowledge and creativity techniques on different sample populations. Importantly, it is found that there is no 'one size fits all' for the use of creative thinking techniques, and to be effectively applied, creative thinking techniques must be developed based upon the respondent's current domain and technique expertise. Moreover, the influence of existing domain-specific knowledge on individual creativity is also dependent upon how that information is primed and the respondent's knowledge of cognitive thinking strategies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creative</field><field name="subject">creative thinking</field><field name="subject">model of the creative thinking process</field><field name="subject">creativity</field><field name="subject">creative thinking process</field><field name="subject">advertising</field><field name="subject">domain specific knowledge</field><field name="subject">creative thinking techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of myostatin during postnatal myogenesis and sarcopenia</field><field name="creator">Siriett, Victoria Katherine</field><field name="description">Myostatin, a TGF-&#946; superfamily member, is a key negative regulator of embryonic and postnatal muscle growth. In order to further elucidate the role of myostatin during postnatal growth, several lines of investigation were undertaken in mice. Analysis of myostatin downstream target genes identified several known and unknown genes. From these, the regulation of an androgen receptor binding co-factor, ARA70, was selected for further investigation. Reverse Northern analysis on the differentially expressed cDNA library indicated an increased expression of ARA70 in myostatin-null muscles, which was later confirmed by Northern blot and semi-quantitative PCR analysis. In corroboration, treatment of myoblast cultures with exogenous myostatin resulted in the down-regulation of ARA70, confirming that myostatin is a negative regulator of ARA70 gene expression. The role of myostatin during sarcopenia, a progressive age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, was also investigated. The atrophy associated with sarcopenia is frequently correlated with insufficient muscle regeneration, resulting from an impaired propensity of satellite cells to activate and a subsequent decline in myogenesis. Myostatin is a known inhibitor of postnatal satellite cell activation and muscle regeneration, thus muscle mass and regeneration, and satellite cell behaviour were examined in young and aged myostatin-null mice. Myostatin-null mice had increased individual muscle weights, as a consequence of massive fibre hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and an increased proportion of type IIB fibres. Aging induced oxidative fibre type changes and atrophy in the wild-type muscle while no fibre type switching was observed in the myostatin-null muscle and atrophy was minimal. No decrease in satellite cell numbers was observed with aging in both genotypes; though a gradual decline in the number of activated satellite cells was noted during aging. However, both young and aged myostatin-null mice displayed increased satellite cells and activation compared to wild-type mice, suggesting a greater myogenic potential in the myostatin-null satellite cells. Consistent with this, aged myostatin-null myoblasts proliferated faster and displayed a higher fusion index during differentiation than the aged wild-type myoblasts, confirming that the reduced sarcopenia in the myostatin-null mice was due to a preserved increase in the myoblast myogenic activity. An increase in a Pax7-only myoblast population from myostatin-null muscle indicated an enhanced satellite cell self-renewal process, consistent with the increased satellite cell number observed on the myostatin-null muscle fibres. Additionally, muscle regeneration of aged myostatin-null muscle following notexin injury was accelerated, and fibre hypertrophy and type were recovered with regeneration, unlike the aged wild-type muscle. Testing the therapeutic value of a myostatin antagonist, Mstn-ant1, indicated that a short term blockade of myostatin by the antagonist significantly enhanced muscle regeneration in aged mice after injury and during sarcopenia. Antagonism of myostatin led to satellite cell activation, increased Pax7 and MyoD protein levels, and greater myoblast and macrophage cell migration culminating in enhanced muscle regeneration in the aged mice. In conclusion, the hypertrophic phenotype associated with myostatin-null mice may in part result from increased androgen receptor (AR) activity due to the up-regulation of ARA70, given that increased expression of the AR leads to hypertrophy. Additionally, the increased muscle mass in myostatin-null mice is likely to result from an augmented myogenic potential and self-renewal process. Overall, a prolonged absence of myostatin reduced sarcopenia and the associated loss of muscle regenerative capacity. Furthermore, the antagonism of myostatin displayed significant therapeutic potential in the alleviation of sarcopenia, through the restoration of the myogenic and inflammatory responses in the aged environment. Thus, the research work clearly demonstrates the role of myostatin in sarcopenia, and documents for the first time a valid therapeutic for alleviating sarcopenia.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">myostatin</field><field name="subject">sarcopenia</field><field name="subject">satellite cells</field><field name="subject">muscle regeneration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Hoeffding Trees</field><field name="creator">Kirkby, Richard Brendon</field><field name="description">Modern information technology allows information to be collected at a far greater rate than ever before. So fast, in fact, that the main problem is making sense of it all. Machine learning offers promise of a solution, but the field mainly focusses on achieving high accuracy when data supply is limited. While this has created sophisticated classification algorithms, many do not cope with increasing data set sizes. When the data set sizes get to a point where they could be considered to represent a continuous supply, or data stream, then incremental classification algorithms are required. In this setting, the effectiveness of an algorithm cannot simply be assessed by accuracy alone. Consideration needs to be given to the memory available to the algorithm and the speed at which data is processed in terms of both the time taken to predict the class of a new data sample and the time taken to include this sample in an incrementally updated classification model.  The Hoeffding tree algorithm is a state-of-the-art method for inducing decision trees from data streams. The aim of this thesis is to improve this algorithm. To measure improvement, a comprehensive framework for evaluating the performance of data stream algorithms is developed. Within the framework memory size is fixed in order to simulate realistic application scenarios. In order to simulate continuous operation, classes of synthetic data are generated providing an evaluation on a large scale. Improvements to many aspects of the Hoeffding tree algorithm are demonstrated. First, a number of methods for handling continuous numeric features are compared. Second, tree prediction strategy is investigated to evaluate the utility of various methods. Finally, the possibility of improving accuracy using ensemble methods is explored.  The experimental results provide meaningful comparisons of accuracy and processing speeds between different modifications of the Hoeffding tree algorithm under various memory limits. The study on numeric attributes demonstrates that sacrificing accuracy for space at the local level often results in improved global accuracy. The prediction strategy shown to perform best adaptively chooses between standard majority class and Naive Bayes prediction in the leaves. The ensemble method investigation shows that combining trees can be worthwhile, but only when sufficient memory is available, and improvement is less likely than in traditional machine learning. In particular, issues are encountered when applying the popular boosting method to streams.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">classification</field><field name="subject">data streams</field><field name="subject">decision trees</field><field name="subject">hoeffding trees</field><field name="subject">boosting</field><field name="subject">bagging</field><field name="subject">option trees</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2568</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Politics of Knowledge and the Reciprocity Gap in the Governance of Intellectual Property Rights</field><field name="creator">Emett, Raewyn Anne</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This study examines the politics of knowledge benefit-sharing within the re-regulatory framework of the Trade-related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement which entered into force in 1995 under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The thesis argues that TRIPS both represents a mainstream legal mechanism for states and organisations to govern ideas through trade, and is characterised by a commercial direction away from multilateralism to bilateralism. In its post-implementation phase, this situation has seen the strongest states and corporations consolidate extensive markets in knowledge goods and services. Through analyses of the various levels of international and national governance within the competitive knowledge structure of international political economy (IPE), this study argues that the politicisation of intellectual property has resulted in the dislocation of reciprocity from its normative roots in fairness and trade equity. In conducting this enquiry the research focuses on the political manifestations of intellectual property consistent with long-standing epistemic considerations of reciprocity to test the extent to which the intrinsic public good value of knowledge and its importance to human societies can be reconciled with the privatisation of public forms of knowledge related to discoveries and innovations. This thesis draws on Becker's virtue-theoretic model of reciprocity premised on normative obligations to social life to ground its claim that an absence of substantive reciprocal requirements capable of sustaining equivalent returns and rewards is detrimental, both theoretically and practically, to the intrinsic socio-cultural foundation and public good value of knowledge. The conceptual framework of reciprocity defined and developed in this study challenges the materialist controlling authority and proprietary ownership vested in intellectual property law. A new conceptual approach proposed through reciprocity, and provoked by on-going debates about IP recognition, knowledge protection, access and distribution is advanced to counter strengthened and expanded IPRs. Theories of knowledge and property drawn from political philosophies are employed to test whether reciprocity is sufficiently robust enough, or even capable of, encompassing the gap between capital and applied science. This thesis argues that hyper-capitalism at global, national and local levels, accompanied by the boundless accumulation of technology, closes down competition both compromising IP as private rights and the viability of their governance. The political implications of the protection and enforcement of private rights through IP is examined in two key chapters utilising empirical data in relation to traditional knowledge (TK) and reciprocity; the first sets the parameters of TK and the second explores aspects of M&#257;ori knowledge systems and reciprocity directed at identifying national and local issues of significance to the debates on IP governance. As a viable direction for knowledge governance this thesis concludes that the gap between the re-regulatory trade framework of intellectual property on the one hand, and reciprocity on the other, requires closing to ameliorate the detrimental disruptions to democratic integrity, fairness and trade equity for significant numbers of communities and peoples around the world.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge</field><field name="subject">Reciprocity</field><field name="subject">Intellectual Property</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Knowledge</field><field name="subject">Public Private Authority</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2569</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationship Between Poverty and HIV/AIDS in Rural Thailand</field><field name="creator">Cameron, Michael Patrick</field><field name="description">HIV/AIDS is a global pandemic with critical demographic, economic, and social implications. The pandemic is widespread in poor regions of the world, including Southeast Asia where its long-term effects are potentially catastrophic. Despite the major impacts of the epidemic being already felt at the household level in many countries, a lack of recognition of the socioeconomic determinants of HIV infection and the economic and social impacts of HIV/AIDS and their relationship with poverty persists. This is due in part to the lack of systematic studies at the household, community, sectoral, and macro levels. The thesis describes a 'vicious circle' between HIV/AIDS, poverty and high-risk behaviour at the individual level. In the poverty-HIV/AIDS cycle, HIV-infected individuals are especially vulnerable to poverty, the poor are more likely to engage in high-risk behaviour such as commercial sex work, and high-risk behaviour in turn makes people susceptible to HIV infection. The thesis examines whether rural Northeast Thailand exhibits characteristics that support the existence of such a cycle. Four key relationships are considered and tested: (i) the relationship between previous HIV infection and current wealth or poverty; (ii) the relationship betweem wealth or poverty and HIV/AIDS knowledge; (iii) the relationship between previous wealth or poverty and current HIV infection; and (iv) the relationship between previous migration and current HIV infection.  All four relationships are shown to hold using survey data from Khon Kaen province in Northeast Thailand. Poverty is shown to increase susceptibility to HIV infection, and HIV/AIDS is shown to reduce wealth and hence increase poverty. Under the circumstances, the hypothesis that rural Northeast Thailand exhibits characteristics that would suggest the existence of a poverty-HIV/AIDS cycle cannot be rejected.  This thesis also provides several key contributions to the literature on HIV/AIDS and poverty. First, it provides quantitative and qualitative empirical analysis of the impacts of HIV/AIDS on households in a moderately affected region of Thailand. Second, it provides empirical analysis both on whether wealth and poverty affect the risk of HIV infection, and whether HIV infection affects wealth and poverty. The results from this thesis also provide significant empirical evidence of the importance of rural-urban migration in the spread of HIV in Asia. Finally, the thesis investigates the potential effects on the poverty-HIV/AIDS cycle of an ongoing socio-economic intervention, namely breaking the poverty-HIV/AIDS cycle via intensive rural development.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS</field><field name="subject">poverty</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">socio-economic impact</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2570</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Unmet Legal, Social and Cultural Needs of M&#257;ori with Disabilities</field><field name="creator">Hickey, Susan Jane</field><field name="description">There is little work done in the area of indigenous disability identity issues and how they are recognised in domestic and international human rights laws. The discourse of disability has always been based on social constructionism and without it, there is no identity.

I also explore the impact of westernised thinking around impairment, in particular the models of disabilities on indigenous well-being. The issues of family (wh&#257;nau), whakawhanaungatanga (family relationships), interdependence (community) and collectivity identities central to indigenous thinking are largely ignored by law and policy, yet central to indigenous identity.

The purpose of this research is to first, highlight the main tensions between the current policy frameworks for the design and the practice of such training. The second purpose is to offer explanations for these tensions by highlighting the competitive free-market and rational individualistic assumptions that underpin the current frameworks and, in particular, how these constrain the 'choices' and possibilities for the most disadvantaged unemployed. The study identifies and examines State Active Neoliberalism, as a specific place-time articulation of neoliberalism, adopted by two successive Labour-led governments in New Zealand from 1999-2005. Thirdly, a community development theoretical framework is proposed to underpin recommendations that could support more enabling and empowering policies for the most disadvantaged unemployed and the organisations that seek to assist them. The thesis draws on case studies of major State-funded training schemes for long-term unemployed individuals to illustrate the 'on-the-ground' consequences of the discursive shifts in policy rhetoric. This research combines an in-depth, qualitative field research approach with a critical analysis of policy frameworks and political representations of unemployment, training and labour market issues in documents, publications and communications. The findings of this research are that a competitive quasi-market for training provision and the increased reliance on narrow outcome measurements, position commercial imperatives ahead of assisting the most disadvantaged unemployed. In order to remain viable, training organisations are increasingly faced with the need to sacrifice social motivations for commercial survival. This situation erodes the scope, at the local level, for services that are relevant to the various needs and circumstances of disadvantaged unemployed people. While the overarching policy discourses maintain that training schemes serve the needs of the most disadvantaged unemployed, policy mechanisms and competitive labour market contexts undermine such objectives. Not only are the most disadvantaged unemployed people frequently unable to access services claiming to be for their benefit, they are by definition less likely to succeed in the context of competitive labour markets and individualised society.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Training</field><field name="subject">unemployment</field><field name="subject">disadvantage</field><field name="subject">community development</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">outcomes</field><field name="subject">providers</field><field name="subject">quasi-markets</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2572</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motivations for Corporate Social Reporting and Non-Reporting in Malaysia: An Exploratory Study From a Public Relations Perspective</field><field name="creator">Tee, Keng Kok</field><field name="description">Corporate social reporting, embracing the triple bottom line reporting concept, entails the reporting of economic, social and environmental performance as opposed to the more narrow focus on conventional financial reporting. Many corporations are now engaging in environmental and social reporting in an effort to communicate the social and environmental effects of organisations&#8223; operations to particular interest groups within society. The main objective of this thesis is to examine corporate motivations and hesitations to undertake social reporting in Malaysia. Most studies have so far applied quantitative method on themes identification to determine rationales for corporate social reporting. Little attention has been given to in-depth primary and secondary data to understand rationales for corporate social reporting in a national context. In addition to motivation, this study fills the gap in the literature by investigating corporate reluctance for social reporting. A qualitative approach was adopted for this study. A mixed method of data collection, consisting of both semi-structured interviews and corporate social reports, was used. A total of 20 interviews were conducted with representatives of six reporting and six non-reporting corporations, and eight non-corporate respondents representing the Malaysian political and social sectors. In addition to primary data, corporate social information in annual reports and corporate websites of six reporting corporations was also collected to support the interviews. Thematic analysis was applied to identify salient themes to explain both corporate motivation and hesitation for social reporting. The analysis was divided into two levels: corporation and society. At the corporate level, results identify public relations as the central motivation for social reporting. More specifically, the concepts of image and identity, issues management, two-way symmetrical and asymmetrical communication, autocommunication, and publicity are used to explain the adoption of social reporting. Image and identity and issues management were also among the concepts applied to explain corporate hesitation for social reporting. However, the results also support stockholder theory and reveal the lack of public relations understanding to be the cause of the low acceptance of social reporting. In-depth analysis revealed organisational legitimacy as the main reason to explain both motivation and hesitation for social reporting. Corporations require stakeholder support for their continual existence. At the societal level analysis, the concept of political economy was applied to explain the limited social reporting practice in the Malaysian context. Finally, the implications for both practising as well as neglecting social reporting are discussed using the concept of the risk society.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate Social Reporting</field><field name="subject">Public Relations</field><field name="subject">qualitative</field><field name="subject">legitimacy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">M&#257;ori social identities in New Zealand and Hawai'i</field><field name="creator">Nikora, Linda Waimarie</field><field name="description">This research is comprised of two narrative interview studies of M&#257;ori in two different settings, New Zealand (n=20) and Hawai'i (n=30).  The data was gathered over the 1994-1996 period.  The two settings have some commonalities and differences.  In both settings M&#257;ori are required to make decisions about the continuity of their ethnic M&#257;ori identities and hereditary cultural identities of iwi, hapu and whanau, and the part that they wish these identities to play in their daily lives.  The focus of this research was about how M&#257;ori create meaning in their lives and maintain their social identities across and within those contexts they move through. The findings of this research suggest that M&#257;ori in New Zealand continue to value and gain meaning and satisfaction from their cultural collectivities and the social identities derived from them.  However, the results tend to suggest that there are changes in the ways that individuals conceptualise these identities and concomitantly, how they see of themselves. For New Zealand participants, conceptions of hapu and iwi appear to be converging with an increasing focus on the physicality of marae, its environment and symbolism, and the social events and relationships negotiated in that space.  New Zealand participants saw some hapu and iwi maintenance activities as more legitimate than others.  More value was placed on returning to hapu and iwi homelands however irregular these returns were.  In contrast, conceptions of hapu and iwi held by participants in Hawai'i seemed less intense.  There were few opportunities to engage with other hapu or iwi members.  Being M&#257;ori had greater meaning and was understood, probed and valued by others in the culturally plural context of Hawai'i.  For New Zealand participants, being M&#257;ori was enacted in the context of being a discriminated, negatively constructed minority.  All were aware of the defining effect that the presence of a dominant majority could have and countered these effects by engaging in social justice and in-group solidarity activities.  The changing identity conceptions held by members of M&#257;ori social groups will have implications for a sense of community and social cohesion, for tribal asset management, service delivery and crown settlement processes.  If M&#257;ori are redefining and renegotiating their social identities to achieve greater meaning and satisfaction then these changes are important to respond to and recognise.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">culture change</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">indigenous psychology</field><field name="subject">Maori identity</field><field name="subject">social identity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2574</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-Resolution Speleothem-Based Palaeoclimate Records From New Zealand Reveal Robust Teleconnection To North Atlantic During MIS 1-4</field><field name="creator">Whittaker, Thomas Edward</field><field name="description">Growth rates, &#948;18O and &#948;13C of five stalagmites from the west coasts of North and South Islands, New Zealand, provide records of millennial-scale climate variability over the last ~75 kyr. Thirty-five uranium-series ages were used to provide the chronology. &#948;18O of stalagmite calcite was influenced by changes in moisture source region, temperature and both &#948;18O and &#948;13C primarily display a negative relationship with rainfall. To assist interpretation of climatic signals &#948;18O profiles were adjusted for the ice-volume effect. Changes in these proxies reflect changes in the strength of the circumpolar westerly circulation and the frequency of southwesterly flow across New Zealand. MIS 4 was a period of wet and cool climate lasting from 67.7 to 61.3 kyr B.P., expressed in the stalagmites by an interval of strongly negative isotope ratios and increased growth rate. This contrasts with less negative &#948;18O and &#948;13C, and slow growth, interpreted as dry and cold climate, during much of MIS 2. This difference between MIS 2 and MIS 4 provides an explanation for why glacial moraines in the Southern Alps of MIS 4 age lie beyond those deposited during the last glacial maximum (MIS 2). Heinrich events, with the exception of H0 (the Younger Dryas), are interpreted from high-resolution South Island stalagmite HW05-3, from Hollywood Cave, West Coast, as times of wetter and cooler climate. Minima in &#948;18O and &#948;13C (wet periods) occurred at 67.7-61.0, 56-55, 50.5-47.5, 40-39, 30.5-29, 25.5-24.3 and 16.1-15. kyr B.P. matching Heinrich events H6-H1 (including H5a) respectively. This demonstrates a robust teleconnection between events in the North Atlantic and New Zealand climate. Minima in &#948;18O also occurred at similar times in less well-dated North Island stalagmite RK05-3 from Ruakuri Cave, Waitomo.  Speleothems from low-latitudes have revealed that Heinrich events forced southerly displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. This caused steepening of the temperature gradient across mid-southern latitudes, increased westerly circulation and resulted in wet conditions on the west coast of both islands. Immediately following H1 in the HW05-3 stable isotope profiles is another excursion to more negative isotopic values, suggesting wet and cold climate, lasting from 14.6 to 13.0 kyr B.P. Such a climate on the West Coast at this time has been previously suggested from glacier advance (e.g. Waiho Loop moraine) and decreased abundance of tall trees on the landscape. This event occurred too early to be a response to H0, but is synchronous with a return to cool climate in Antarctica. Thus West Coast climate appears to have been sensitive to changes in Antarctica as well as the North Atlantic. Isotopic minima (wet and cool climate) in South Island stalagmite GT05-5, which formed during the Holocene, first occurred 4.6 kyr B.P. This began a series of four oscillations in isotope ratios, the last terminating when the stalagmite was collected (2006). Onset of these oscillations is associated with initiation of ice advance in the Southern Alps, and beginning of the Neoglacial. The last oscillation displays enriched isotope ratios lasting from 1.2 to 0.8 kyr B.P. succeeded by depleted ratios lasting until 0.15 kyr B.P., mirroring the Medieval Climate Optimum and Little Ice Age, respectively, of European palaeoclimate records.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Westland</field><field name="subject">Waitomo</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">palaeoclimate</field><field name="subject">speleothems</field><field name="subject">oxygen isotopes</field><field name="subject">carbon isotopes</field><field name="subject">growth rates</field><field name="subject">Heinrich events</field><field name="subject">MIS 4</field><field name="subject">last glacial maximum</field><field name="subject">Holocene</field><field name="subject">Little Ice Age</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2575</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Boarders, Babes and Bad-Asses: Theories of a Female Physical Youth Culture</field><field name="creator">Thorpe, Holly Aysha</field><field name="description">Young women occupy unprecedented space in contemporary society. Their professional ambitions, educational achievements, practices of cultural consumption, and participation in sport and leisure all offer evidence of a new position for young women. This thesis analyzes female snowboarders as exemplars of young women in contemporary society and popular physical culture. Many young women today play sport and engage in physical activity with a sense of enthusiasm and entitlement unknown to most of their mothers and grandmothers. Against this background the female snowboarder is an excellent barometer of the nature of contemporary youth and popular culture, of the changes in those cultures including the development of niche female cultural industries, and of the emerging opportunities available to middle-class women in Western society.  Women's snowboarding, however, is a complicated and multidimensional phenomenon interwoven with numerous political, cultural, social and economic events and processes. In this thesis I set out to capture the complexity of female snowboarding by systematically contextualizing and interrogating the lived experiences of female boarders through drawing upon six critical social theoretical perspectives: Marxist political economy, post-Fordism, feminism, hegemonic masculinity, Pierre Bourdieu's theory of embodiment, and Foucauldian theorizing. In applying these theories, I select key concepts and engage them in conversations with my insider cultural knowledge of snowboarding, numerous periods of fieldwork, and an extensive base of artifacts and sources collected over five years.  In this thesis I extend academic understandings of female youth culture via the case study of women in snowboarding, and offer a valuable critique of contemporary social theories used to explain many different social phenomena that involve tensions and power relationships between the genders. While no single theory or concept proved adequate to deal with the multidimensional phenomenon of the female boarder, each having its shortcomings and offering quite different insights, several reveal important commonalities in relation to some key concepts in critical sociology, viz, structure, agency, culture, the body and embodiment, gender and power.

As the critique is primarily concentrated at the depth level, romantic love is examined via the medium of Cinderella folklore, with particular focus on Andy Tennant's 1998 film adaptation of Cinderella, Ever After.  Based on a Jungian approach to the psyche and psychic products, the methodological framework incorporates the three following tools: The tool of interpretation at the subjective level, in which the characters of the Cinderella fairy tale are read symbolically rather than taken to denote literal fictitious characters; the tool of constructive analysis, in which it is argued that romantic love is more than 'nothing but' a boy/girl love story or 'nothing but' a myth depicting patriarchal oppression; and the tool of amplification, in which archetypal similarities between the Christian myth and the Cinderella fairy tale are highlighted.	The central argument of this critique is that while romantic love does not provide a viable model of relatedness if taken and practiced literally, the romantic myth nonetheless contains within it the basis for a fuller and richer experience of love and relatedness if read subjectively.  The rationale for a depth critique of romantic love is based upon the Jungian postulate that phenomena such as dreams and myths issue fundamentally from the unconscious psychic realm, and further upon Jung's recognition of a psychological developmental process he refers to as 'individuation' activated by engagement with the products of the unconscious.  A symbolic/psychological reading of romantic love brings to light that romantic desire toward another is an outward manifestation of an inner desire for individual realisation, and is expressive of the individual's own capacity for wholeness.  The value of a symbolic reading of romantic love is appreciated if it is conceived that it is precisely individual realisation that forms the basis for what is referred to by Erich Fromm as productive or knowledge-based love, argued here to be the ideal and only firm basis for human relatedness generally and intimate relatedness specifically.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Romantic love</field><field name="subject">Jungian psychology</field><field name="subject">Fate</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2577</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Richard Rolle, Emendatio vitae: Amendinge of Lyf, a Middle English translation, edited from Dublin, Trinity College, MS 432</field><field name="creator">Kempster, John Hugh</field><field name="description">Emendatio vitae was the most widely copied of all Richard Rolle&#8217;s writings in fourteenth and fifteenth-century England, and yet in modern scholarship this important work and its early audience have received comparatively little scholarly attention. My aim has been to address this lacuna by producing an edition of one of the seven Middle English translations of the text - Amendinge of Lyf - with notes and glossary. In an introductory study I adopt a dual focus: Rolle&#8217;s intended audience, and the actual early readers of this particular Middle English translation. Firstly, I conclude that Rolle may have intended Emendatio vitae as a work of &#8216;pastoralia&#8217;, for secular priests, and therefore with a wider audience of the laity also in mind. This being the case, it demonstrates that the adaptation of traditionally eremitic contemplative writings for a general audience, so widespread in the fifteenth-century, was already stirring in Rolle&#8217;s day. Secondly, I look in detail at a specific crosssection of Rolle&#8217;s early readership: a translator, several scribes and correctors, and other early readers and owners. The striking thing about this segment of the text&#8217;s reception is its breadth, including a priest, a number of prominent lay women and men, and by the end of the fifteenth-century also Dominican and Benedictine nuns.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Richard Rolle</field><field name="subject">Emendatio vitae</field><field name="subject">Amendinge of Lyf</field><field name="subject">Mending of Life</field><field name="subject">Hermit</field><field name="subject">Hampole</field><field name="subject">Contemplative</field><field name="subject">Contemplation</field><field name="subject">Mystic</field><field name="subject">Mysticism</field><field name="subject">Middle English Mystics</field><field name="subject">Fourteenth-century England</field><field name="subject">Fifteenth-century England</field><field name="subject">Contemplative Spirituality</field><field name="subject">Vernacular Theology</field><field name="subject">Monasticism</field><field name="subject">Lay Literacy</field><field name="subject">Nicholas Watson</field><field name="subject">Ralph Hanna</field><field name="subject">Hope Emily Allen</field><field name="subject">Rudiger Spahl</field><field name="subject">Alexandra Barratt</field><field name="subject">Medieval</field><field name="subject">Translator</field><field name="subject">Translation</field><field name="subject">Scribe</field><field name="subject">Copyist</field><field name="subject">Editor</field><field name="subject">Edition</field><field name="subject">Middle English Edition</field><field name="subject">Middle English Translation</field><field name="subject">Dominican</field><field name="subject">Benedictine</field><field name="subject">Pastoralia</field><field name="subject">Parnell Wrottesly</field><field name="subject">Nuns</field><field name="subject">Nunnery</field><field name="subject">Monks</field><field name="subject">Monastry</field><field name="subject">Linguistic Atlas</field><field name="subject">Linguistic Profile</field><field name="subject">Paleography</field><field name="subject">Eremitic</field><field name="subject">Glossary</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2578</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand Wars Documentary Series: Discursive Struggle and Cultural Memory.</field><field name="creator">Perrott, Lisa</field><field name="description">The 1998 television broadcast of The New Zealand Wars documentary series was a significant public event, which had a major impact on a broad range of communities and individuals in Aotearoa New Zealand. This popular television history engaged with issues of historical veracity, race, culture and nationhood and challenged previously dominant discourses associated with these concepts. In doing so, it provoked heated debate, and a re-imagining of 'nation', and also opened up spaces for alternative ways of engaging with historical narrative. Informed by post-colonialism, cultural studies and cultural memory, this thesis explores the discursive and affective role of The New Zealand Wars, as it has operated within the turbulent climate of 1990s New Zealand cultural relations. This catalytic function is described in this thesis as a phenomenon of a television series shaped by, whilst also intervening in, processes of cultural colonisation and decolonisation. While both of these processes involve the transmission of discourse via cultural forms, the act of cultural decolonisation requires, in addition, the convergence of a number of agents (people and communities, discursive and memory resources) and circumstances, within particular contextual conditions. Such a convergence provided the conditions for the discursive synthesis, which shaped the production, construction and reception of this series. The role of audio-visual media (and specifically television documentary) in transmitting cultural memory is significant as it enables the flow of memory through channels or forms (such as visual, oral and aural traditions) that can bring about new perspectives and critical reflections upon colonial discourse and dominant concepts of nation and culture. In addition to these social and intellectual processes of audience engagement, this thesis argues that experiential and affective dimensions of cultural memory can (in these specific circumstances) open up radical spaces, offering the potential for generating awareness and sparking political action. These issues are explored through a tripartite analysis of the production context, construction and reception of The New Zealand Wars series. The integration of these three phases of analysis has generated a number of insights into the potential of audio-visual forms, including their producers and audiences, to participate in the negotiation of, and resistance to, colonial discourse. Such insights serve to challenge taken-for-granted constructions of nation and history, and suggest the increasing relevance of alternative concepts such as community-building and cultural memory. Ultimately, this thesis argues that television documentary can serve as a prime site for the articulation of these concepts. The New Zealand Wars serves as a case study, which demonstrates both the potential of this site, and the significance of the social-historical and cultural context in framing this series.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Television Documentary</field><field name="subject">Reception Studies</field><field name="subject">Cultural Memory</field><field name="subject">Discourse</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2579</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bovine mastitis and ecology of Streptococcus uberis</field><field name="creator">Pryor, Shona Marie</field><field name="description">Bovine mastitis caused by Streptococcus uberis is a common problem in pasture-based dairying systems. This study examines both the ecology of S. uberis and infection of the bovine mammary gland on a New Zealand dairy farm. Initially, the REP-PCR strain typing method was developed and the potential of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry evaluated as a strain typing method. While strain-specific mass spectra were obtained with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, the irreproducibility of spectra was its major downfall. With further work, this rapid method could be very useful for strain typing S. uberis on a large scale. Using optimised REP-PCR and anchored typing methods, multiple S. uberis strains were isolated and strain typed from the dairy environment, including farm races and paddocks, faeces, teat skin, the cow body and from intramammary infections. High strain diversity was observed in all sampled locations; however, some strains were found at more than one site, suggesting transmission may occur between the environment and cows. The most likely means of S. uberis distribution throughout the dairy farm was via excretion with faeces and, although not all cow faeces contained this pathogen, the gastrointestinal tract of some cows appeared to be colonised by specific strains, resulting in persistent shedding of this bacteria in the faeces. Infection of the mammary gland is likely to occur through contamination of the teat skin with highly diverse environmental strains of S. uberis. However, only one or two strains are generally found in milk from mastitis cases, suggesting that, although infection may arise from a random or opportunistic event, a strain selection process may take place. Intramammary challenge with multiple strains of S. uberis revealed that selection of a single infective strain can occur within the mammary gland. The predominance of one strain over others may be related to production of virulence factors allowing enhanced ability to establish in the gland and evade the immune response, or due to direct competition between strains through the production of antimicrobial factors such as bacteriocins. In addition to strain-specific factors, the individual cow and quarter response may play an important role in the development of infection and selection of the infective strain. Using results from this study, a model of S. uberis strain transmission has been proposed, which includes potential mechanisms of infection and persistence of S. uberis within the mammary gland.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bovine</field><field name="subject">mastitis</field><field name="subject">Streptococcus uberis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2580</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive Vision Based Scene Registration for Outdoor Augmented Reality</field><field name="creator">Catchpole, Jason James</field><field name="description">Augmented Reality (AR) involves adding virtual content into real scenes. Scenes are viewed using a Head-Mounted Display or other display type. In order to place content into the user's view of a scene, the user's position and orientation relative to the scene, commonly referred to as their pose, must be determined accurately. This allows the objects to be placed in the correct positions and to remain there when the user moves or the scene changes. It is achieved by tracking the user in relation to their environment using a variety of technology. One technology which has proven to provide accurate results is computer vision. Computer vision involves a computer analysing images and achieving an understanding of them. This may be locating objects such as faces in the images, or in the case of AR, determining the pose of the user.  One of the ultimate goals of AR systems is to be capable of operating under any condition. For example, a computer vision system must be robust under a range of different scene types, and under unpredictable environmental conditions due to variable illumination and weather. The majority of existing literature tests algorithms under the assumption of ideal or 'normal' imaging conditions. To ensure robustness under as many circumstances as possible it is also important to evaluate the systems under adverse conditions.  This thesis seeks to analyse the effects that variable illumination has on computer vision algorithms. To enable this analysis, test data is required to isolate weather and illumination effects, without other factors such as changes in viewpoint that would bias the results. A new dataset is presented which also allows controlled viewpoint differences in the presence of weather and illumination changes. This is achieved by capturing video from a camera undergoing a repeatable motion sequence. Ground truth data is stored per frame allowing images from the same position under differing environmental conditions, to be easily extracted from the videos.  An in depth analysis of six detection algorithms and five matching techniques demonstrates the impact that non-uniform illumination changes can have on vision algorithms. Specifically, shadows can degrade performance and reduce confidence in the system, decrease reliability, or even completely prevent successful operation.  An investigation into approaches to improve performance yields techniques that can help reduce the impact of shadows. A novel algorithm is presented that merges reference data captured at different times, resulting in reference data with minimal shadow effects. This can significantly improve performance and reliability when operating on images containing shadow effects. These advances improve the robustness of computer vision systems and extend the range of conditions in which they can operate. This can increase the usefulness of the algorithms and the AR systems that employ them.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer vision</field><field name="subject">augmented reality</field><field name="subject">AR</field><field name="subject">non-uniform illumination</field><field name="subject">shadows</field><field name="subject">local feature detector</field><field name="subject">MSER</field><field name="subject">SIFT</field><field name="subject">affine covariant</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2581</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Portable Generator Incorporating Mini-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells</field><field name="creator">Hyde, Andrew Justin</field><field name="description">Modern society has become reliant on battery powered electronic devices such as cell phones and laptop computers.  The standard way of recharging these devices is by connecting to a reticulated electricity supply.  In situations with no electricity supply some other recharging method is required.  Such a possibility is a small, portable, generator based on fuel cell technology, specifically mini-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (MT-SOFC).  MT-SOFCs have been developed since the 1990s but there is limited analysis, discussion or research on developing and constructing a portable generator based on MT-SOFC technology.  Such a generator, running on a portable gas supply, requires combining the key aspects of cell performance, a heating and fuel reforming system, and cell manifolds.  Cell design, fuel type, fuel flow rate, current-collection method and operating temperature all greatly affected MT-SOFCs performance. Segmenting the cathode significantly increased the power output. Maximum power density from an electrolyte supported MT-SOFC was 140 mW/cm2.  The partial oxidation reactor (POR) developed provided the required heat to maintain the MT-SOFCs at an operating temperature suitable for generating electricity.  The exhaust gas from the POR was a suitable fuel for MT-SOFCs, having sufficient carbon monoxide and hydrogen to generate electricity.  Various manifold materials were evaluated including solid metal blocks and folded sheet metal.  It was found that manifolds made from easily worked alumina fibre board decreased the thermal stresses and therefore the fracture rate of the MT-SOFCs.  The final prototype developed comprised a partial oxidation reactor and MT-SOFCs mounted in alumina fibre board manifolds within a well-insulated enclosure, which could be run on LPG.  Calculated efficiency of the final prototype was 4%.  If all the carbon monoxide and hydrogen produced by the partial oxidation reactor were converted to electrical energy, efficiency would increase to 39%. Under ideal conditions, efficiency would be 78%.  Efficiency of the prototype can be improved by increasing the fuel and oxygen utilisation ratios, ensuring heat from the exhaust gases is transferred to the incoming gases, and improving the methods for collecting current at both the anode and cathode.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">portable</field><field name="subject">generator</field><field name="subject">electricity</field><field name="subject">mini-tubular</field><field name="subject">micro-tubular</field><field name="subject">tubular</field><field name="subject">solid oxide fuel cell</field><field name="subject">SOFC</field><field name="subject">partial oxidation</field><field name="subject">reforming</field><field name="subject">liquid petroleum gas</field><field name="subject">LPG</field><field name="subject">efficiency</field><field name="subject">gas analysis</field><field name="subject">electrochemical analysis</field><field name="subject">manifolds</field><field name="subject">stack</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2582</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A paradox in action? A critical analysis of an appreciative inquiry</field><field name="creator">Grant, Suzanne Lisa Parker</field><field name="description">A journey comprised of three paths is the metaphor through which I i)	reflect and report on my involvement with four New Zealand primary school Boards of Trustees (BOTs) investigating the emancipatory potential that applications of information and communication technologies (ICTs) may have on their governance processes, ii)	analyse appreciative inquiry through application(s) of critical theory, with specific reference to the investigation above so as to deepen understanding of the research method, and iii)	reflect on my personal development, as achieved through my engagement with participants and the research process. 	Stemming from an interest in improving school governance I was keen to identify current use of ICTs by BOTs and to work with them to identify potential applications. Appreciative inquiry with its focus on enhancing existing positive organisational attributes seemed to provide an appropriate structure for my investigation. At the back of my mind however, a concern was formulating: Does this method of research deliver the benefits the literature espouses? What influence would the positive orientation have on the research process and on the power dynamics within the research environment? Complementary streams of critical thinking and reflexivity were invoked to assist my analysis.  Applications of ICTs which may appear 'helpful' to BOT governance processes are identified in this report. However, uncritical uptake of these applications may not necessarily be consistent with the emancipatory intentions I aspire to. Framed within Habermas' theory of communicative action, the potential colonisation of the BOT lifeworld by the system is considered. Domesticating influences may potentially constrain democratic processes at local school and societal levels.  The participatory action research process undertaken facilitated a deepened understanding of governance for all involved. Identification of time and funding constraints indicates BOTs may be prevented from reaching their true potential. Attempts to enhance governance through additional applications of ICTs will be of minimal effect unless efforts are made to better understand and resource the governance efforts of Trustees. Purported empowerment of the community as mandated in the Education Act 1989 comes with a heavy cost, for schools and individuals. Care must be taken to ensure that 'efficiency' gains are not made at the expense of democratic processes. Critical analysis of appreciative inquiry as a research method highlights the influences of power and language use within the research process. Appreciative inquiry should be seen as a process for, rather than a master of change. The contribution of appreciative inquiry to organisational and personal transformation may be drawn from the ontological basis of the approach rather than from the technicalities of a specific form of implementation. I suggest the focus on what is 'good' be made more complex, to recognise that appreciation may also mean 'to know, to be conscious of, to take full and sufficient account of'. Application of an enhanced definition of appreciation has deepened my understanding of not only the situation under investigation but also the research process itself. Through my enhanced concept of 'appreciation' embedded and sometimes obscured influences were highlighted, better understood, and at times transformed to serve the emancipatory aspirations of participants.  In keeping with the reflexivity mandated by my commitment to critical theory and action research, I applied this enhanced definition of appreciation to my personal development during my engagement with participants and the research process. My struggles to apply my chosen social constructionist and critical theory lenses to this work are evident in my attempts to work with the largely functionalist literature in this field and the influence of my undergraduate education. Recognising the theoretical and personal developments I gained as I travelled the three paths of my PhD journey, the scene is now set for me to challenge the predominance of functionalist, mechanistic metaphors which dominate organisational literature. In doing so, I seek an alternative approach to understanding organisational activity; and a new vocabulary through which I might extend my understanding, and negotiate new and emancipatory meaning(s) with others.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Appreciative inquiry</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">critical theory</field><field name="subject">school boards of trustees</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2583</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kakai Tonga 'i Okalani Nu'u Sila: Tongan Generations in Auckland New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Brown Pulu, Teena Joanne</field><field name="description">This thesis is written in the format of a three act play. The author has elected this structure to frame the ethnographic data and analysis because it seemed befitting for telling my own life story alongside the memories of three generations of my matrilateral and patrilateral Tongan family residing in Auckland New Zealand. Thus, actors and scenes play out the thesis storyline in three parts where each act is titled Prologue, Dialogue and Epilogue. The Prologue, part one of this three act play, is three chapters which sets in motion the main actors - the research participants, and the scenes - the ethnographic context in which data was collected. It represents an ethnographic mosaic of memory and meaning as co-constructed by actors in recounting how they make sense of their place, their time, in a transnational history, that is, a family of stories among three Tongan generations residing largely in Auckland New Zealand. The Dialogue, part two of this three act play, is four chapters which maps out the theoretical and ethnographic territory that actors and scenes border-cross to visit. By this, I mean that research participants are political actors subject to social factors which shape how their memories and ensuing meanings are selectively reproduced in certain contexts of retelling the past and its relevance to understanding the present. The Epilogue, part three of this three act play, is the curtain call for the closing chapter. It presents an ending in which a new 'identity' entry made by the youngest Tongan generation creates possibilities for social change not yet experienced by prior generations residing in Auckland New Zealand. This thesis is woven into an overarching argument. Here, three generations of my matrilateral and patrilateral Tongan family residing in Auckland New Zealand intersect through two modes of memory and meaning. First, family reconstruct collective memories of 'identity' and 'culture' to make sense of how their ancestral origin, their historical past, is meaningful in their transnational lives and lifestyles. Second, inter-generational change among Tongan family residing in Auckland New Zealand is a social-political product of the transnational condition experienced by ethnic-cultural groups categorised as 'minorities' in the developed world.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social memory</field><field name="subject">transnational history</field><field name="subject">inter-generational change</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2584</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visitors to a Theme Park - Motives and Satisfaction: The Case of Janfusun, Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Yeh, Shih-Shuo (Sam)</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study that aims to understand the pre, during and post visit behaviours of theme park visitors. This study took place at Janfusun Fancyworld, which is situated at Gukeng village Yun-Lin County, Taiwan. The park was the first Taiwanese theme park to achieve ISO 9002 and has hosted over 2 million visitors every year almost since its inception over a decade ago. By these criteria Janfusun is considered the leading theme park in Taiwan. Theme parks originally emerged from medieval and travelling fairs, but the success of locations such as Coney Island in the late nineteenth century introduced the element of exciting rides. At present the definition of a 'theme park' might be said to be an 'amusement park' that possesses a central theme based on history, fiction or other core. However, it is the researcher's own observation that Janfusun focuses more on the installation of hardware facilities, but pays less attention in creating an unifying theme. This situation may have affected the research outcome since Janfusun operates more as an 'amusement park' from a western perspective but markets itself as a 'theme park' within Taiwan, and is consistent with a Taiwanese understanding of the term of being a 'theme park'. The main hypothesis adopted in this study is that satisfaction may be of two types: (1) generic, which relates to general 'push' needs such as those for relaxation, and (2) site specific, which relate to destination attraction features and 'pull' determinants. This thesis argues that the satisfaction of generic motives such as the requirement for relaxation and escape is contingent upon the ability of the attraction to meet the visit motives specific to the attraction. For example, a need for escape would not be met if a theme park visitor found the rides uninspiring, the portrayal of fantasy unconvincing and the food poor. Furthermore, researchers such as Foster (1999) suggest that some destination attributes, while considered important by the tourists, rarely act as an incentive to choose a specific destination, but the absence of these attributes can be a powerful deterrent. Some of the attributes, such as 'accessible toilets' and 'a place to rest', are considered as convenience factors in this thesis. This thesis attempts to understand the relationship of push, pull and convenience factors to the visitors' overall satisfaction. Also, this thesis tries to understand the role of socio-demographic variables in determining overall satisfaction. This thesis also includes a longitudinal study that allows the research to capture the effect of changes to visitors. For example, Janfusun has newly installed an artificial beach and wave feature that serves the social needs of its visitors. This thesis also examines the importance of repeat visitation in determining visitors' motivations and experiences. For example, it was found that visitors with high repeat visits are more aware of the 'new rides' than the first time visitors. Finally the last chapter attempts to answer two key questions, (a) why are the findings of importance to both conceptual literature and management practice, and (b) what might future researchers learn from this thesis. The objectives of this thesis are thus summarised as to: 1. Conduct a longitudinal study in Janfusun. 2. Identify visitors' pre-visit behaviour, which is associated with generic motives and push factors. 3. Identify visitors' during-visit behaviour, which is associated with site-specific features and pull factors. 4. Identify post-visit behaviour, which is associated with satisfaction and loyalty. 5. Identify the causal relationships between pre, during and post visit behaviours and conceptualise a model. 6. Identify the role of convenience factors.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theme parks</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="subject">amusement parks</field><field name="subject">tourists</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">visitor satisfaction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2585</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Governing globalization in South Asia through a legal praxis of human rights, development and democracy</field><field name="creator">Tittawella, Suranjika Erangani</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT  This doctoral thesis in law seeks to understand, and begin to remedy, the immense and avoidable poverty that disenfranchises at least 30 percent of the world's most populous region. Defining South Asia as Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the study analyses the multidimensional nature, historical origins and modern dynamics of both this material poverty and poverties of human rights, democracy and development. Both critical analysis and creative response are framed within legal history, human rights jurisprudence, constitutional and administrative law, comparative law and public international law, but the author draws extensively on political economy and history, and partially on philosophy, and cultural studies.  Chapter 1 traces the Western evolution of the universal human rights regime, first  globalized  in 1948 by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It also traces South Asian sociopolitical and religious articulations of human dignity and limitations on legitimate power through the ages. Mostly contrary to culturally relativist claims, South Asia's human rights needs are found to be well served by a genuinely universalist regime including justiciable economic, social and cultural rights as inseparable from civil and political.  Chapters 2 and 3 survey the historical  globalizations  that have impacted on South Asia. Although globalization is shown to be a neutral phenomenon, the author identifies the insidious contemporary propagation of a particular neo-liberal ideology as being globalization's inevitable and optimal form. The study analyses this propagation by the International Financial Institutions the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, acting through Structural Adjustment Policies and only partially corrective Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers. Neo-liberalism supposedly unshackles benign market forces from distorting governmental rules to create spontaneous growth that trickles down to the poor; in fact it employs its own rules to privilege the already wealthy, especially Western capital and transnational corporations (TNCs).  The thesis urges South Asia to  govern globalization  pro-actively, seeking the virtuous circle of human rights, plural democracy and equitable development. Positive signs have already included national membership in, and constitutional enshrinement of, universal human rights norms, and certain efforts of civil society and non-governmental organizations, fostered at times by activist judiciaries. Chapter 4 nevertheless catalogues overriding failures to internalize plural democracy and the rule of law, leaving rights nominal and democratic structures hollow. Governments have been obsequious to neo-liberal hegemony, insouciant to their underclasses and exploitative of religious schisms in appeal to tyrannous majoritarianism. The South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation is shown as an inadequate response to the region's multidimensional poverties.  Adapting instead the best practices of the Council of Europe, the Organization of American States, the African Union, and the British Commonwealth from Chapter 5, Chapter 6 details a  South Asian Union for Human Rights Development and Democracy  to replace SAARC. This new regional response complements global human rights norms and offers South Asia solidarity in confronting neo-liberalism, and holding TNCs, IFIs and especially their own governments accountable to the rule of law, equitable development, deep democracy, wide human rights, and  larger freedom  in peace and security.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Globalization</field><field name="subject">South Asia</field><field name="subject">Human Rights</field><field name="subject">Democracy</field><field name="subject">Development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2586</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automating iterative tasks with programming by demonstration</field><field name="creator">Paynter, Gordon W.</field><field name="description">Programming by demonstration is an end-user programming technique that allows people to create programs by showing the computer examples of what they want to do. Users do not need specialised programming skills. Instead, they instruct the computer by demonstrating examples, much as they might show another person how to do the task. Programming by demonstration empowers users to create programs that perform tedious and time-consuming computer chores. However, it is not in widespread use, and is instead confined to research applications that end users never see. This makes it difficult to evaluate programming by demonstration tools and techniques.  This thesis claims that domain-independent programming by demonstration can be made available in existing applications and used to automate iterative tasks by end users. It is supported by Familiar, a domain-independent, AppleScript-based programming-by-demonstration tool embodying standard machine learning algorithms. Familiar is designed for end users, so works in the existing applications that they regularly use.  The assertion that programming by demonstration can be made available in existing applications is validated by identifying the relevant platform requirements and a range of platforms that meet them. A detailed scrutiny of AppleScript highlights problems with the architecture and with many implementations, and yields a set of guidelines for designing applications that support programming-by-demonstration.

By introducing an equilibrium between Eact, the active form of enzyme, and Einact, a reversibly inactivated form of enzyme, the Equilibrium Model explains apparent enzyme activity loss at high temperatures that cannot be accounted for by irreversible thermal denaturation.  The Equilibrium Model describes enzyme behavior in the presence of substrates and under assay conditions; thus its associated parameters, deltaHeq and Teq, may have physiological significance. The Equilibrium Model parameters have been determined for twenty-one enzymes of diverse origins.  The results demonstrated the wide applicability of the Equilibrium Model to enzymes of different types and temperature affinity.  The study has also established deltaHeq as the first quantitative measure of enzyme eurythermalism and demonstrated the relationship between Teq and optimal growth temperature of organisms.  The Equilibrium Model is therefore a useful tool for studying enzyme temperature adaptation and its role in adaptations to thermophily and eurythermalism.  Moreover, it potentially enables a description of the originating environment from the properties of the enzymes. The Equilibrium Model has been employed to characterize enzymes isolated from bacterial episymbionts of Alvinella pompejana.  A. pompejana inhabits one of the most extreme environments known to science and has been proposed as an extremely eurythermal organism.  A metagenomic study of the A. pompejana episymbionts has unveiled new information related to the adaptive and metabolic properties of the bacterial consortium; the availability of metagenomic sequences has also enabled targeted retrieval and heterologous expression of A. pompejana episymbiont genes.  By inspecting enzymes derived from the unique episymbiotic microbial consortium intimately associated with A. pompejana, the study has shed light on temperature adaptations in this unique symbiotic relationship.  The findings suggested that eurythermal enzymes are one of the mechanisms used by the microbial consortium to achieve its adaptations. By combining metagenomic and enzymological studies, the research described in this thesis has lead to insights on the eurythermalism of a complex microbial system from an enzymological aspect.  The findings have enhanced our knowledge on how life adapts to extreme environments, and the validation of the Equilibrium Model as a tool for studying enzyme temperature adaptation paves the way for future studies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Equilibrium Model</field><field name="subject">enzyme kinetics</field><field name="subject">temperature adaptation</field><field name="subject">metagenomics</field><field name="subject">recombinant protein</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2588</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processes of Pakeha change in response to the Treaty of Waitangi</field><field name="creator">Huygens, Ingrid Louise Maria</field><field name="description">The sense of crisis that marks our times may be seen as a crisis for dominant groups whose once-secure hegemony is being challenged by marginalised others. It is in theorising the reply from the dominant group to the voices of the oppressed that existing Western conceptions of social change fall silent. The dominant Pakeha group in Aotearoa New Zealand has used discourses of benign colonisation and harmonious race relations to resist 165 years of communication from indigenous M&#257;ori about their oppression and a dishonoured treaty for settlement. My research documents the appearance of the Treaty of Waitangi into the Pakeha consciousness, and the now 30 year-long response by a Pakeha antiracism movement to educate their own cultural group about its agreements. Targeting government, community and social services organisations, activist educators used Freire's (1975) approach of conscientising dialogue to present a more critical view of colonisation, and to encourage participants to consider the complicity of their organisations in ongoing structural and cultural racism.  Based on my membership of local and national networks of activist educators, I was able to organise and facilitate data gathering from three sources to investigate processes of Pakeha change in: (i) unpublished material describing the antiracism and Treaty movement's historical theorising and strategies over 30 years, (ii) a country-wide process of co-theorising among contemporary Treaty educator groups about their work and perceived influence, and (iii) a collection of organisational accounts of Treaty-focused change. The collected records confirmed that a coherent anti-colonial discourse, which I have termed 'Pakeha honouring the Treaty', was in use to construct institutional and constitutional changes in non-government organisations. My interpretation of key elements in a local theory of transforming action included emotional responses to counter-cultural information, collective work for cultural and institutional change and practising a mutually agreed relationship with M&#257;ori. I concluded that these emotional, collective and relationship processes in dominant group change were crucial in helping to construct the new conceptual resources of 'affirming M&#257;ori authority' and 'striving towards a right relationship with M&#257;ori'. These counter-colonial constructions allowed Pakeha a non-resistant and facilitative response to M&#257;ori challenge, and enabled a dialogue with M&#257;ori about decolonisation. By examining in one research programme the genealogy and interdependencies of a new discourse, my research contributes to theorising about the production of new, counter-hegemonic discourses, and confirms the crucial part played by social movements in developing new, liberatory constructions of the social order.  My research calls for further theory-building on (i) emotional and spiritual aspects of transformational learning, (ii) processes involved in consciously-undertaken cultural change by dominant/coloniser groups, and (iii) practising of mutually agreed relationships with indigenous peoples by dominant/coloniser groups. My research has implications for theorising how coloniser and dominant groups generally may participate in liberatory social change and decolonisation work, and  the part played by the Western states in the global struggles by indigenous people for recognition of their world-views and aspirations.  It remains to be seen whether counter-colonial discourses and organisational changes aimed at 'honouring the Treaty' with indigenous peoples will be sufficiently widely adopted to help transform Western dominating cultures and colonial projects. In the meantime, acknowledging and documenting these counter-colonial discourses and their constructions opens up increasing possibilities for constructing, from a history of colonisation, a different future.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pakeha change</field><field name="subject">Maori authority</field><field name="subject">the Treaty of Waitangi</field><field name="subject">te Tiriti o Waitangi</field><field name="subject">decolonisastion</field><field name="subject">conscientisation</field><field name="subject">antiracism education</field><field name="subject">social movement participatory research</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2589</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of a Novel Controlled Release Drug Delivery System</field><field name="creator">Babu, Kavitha Mary Vadakkel</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to formulate, characterise and assess the feasibility of a novel drug delivery system known as the in situ gelling matrix (ISGM) where a hydrophilic polymer is suspended in a non-aqueous solvent that converts into a gel when injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly thus giving a controlled release matrix for a drug.  Although the concept has been patented with claims that this kind of drug delivery is achievable in theory for a wide variety of candidate substances, actual formulation studies for making a commercially viable product for this technology are completely lacking in practice.   The research embodied in this thesis addresses this lack.  Initial studies involved conducting a biocompatibility study using the HET-CAM (hens egg test - chorioallantoic membrane) test on a range of possible ingredients for the delivery system.  The materials deemed biocompatible were then carried through to a screening process where the physical stability of the hydrophilic polymers in non-aqueous solvents was monitored.  It was found that the hydrophilic polymers tested sedimented rapidly in the non-aqueous solvents indicating such a system was not physically stable.  Consequently, density-inducing or viscosity-inducing agents were added to the non-aqueous solvents to retard the sedimentation rate.  The addition of polycarbophil, a viscosity-inducing agent, clearly increased the viscosity of the system.  However, undesirable formation of polycarbophil globules occurred during the manufacturing process, which caused batch-to-batch variations in the viscosity of the continuous phase. Various manufacturing methods were tested before arriving at the optimum procedure to prevent globule formation using a high speed dispersion tool.  A final physical sedimentation analysis of candidate continuous phases and hydrophilic polymers was conducted for determining the ideal combination of ingredients to use in the system.  These investigations finally led to the adoption of an optimum mix of components consisting of 10% (w/w) hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) (the hydrophilic polymer) suspended in a continuous phase of propylene glycol (the non-aqueous solvent) containing 0.67% (w/w) polycarbophil (the viscosity inducing agent).  Using this mix of components, the in situ gelling matrix system was then subjected to various characterisation studies including infrared (IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry and redispersion studies.  The chemical stability of the hydrophilic polymer and the continuous phase (the non-aqueous solvent and polycarbophil) was monitored and were found to be chemically stable over a 9 month period.  The feasibility of the in situ gelling matrix technology as a controlled release device was assessed using the drug propranolol.  In vitro drug release studies were conducted using a custom-built dissolution apparatus.  The effect of various parameters such as the concentration of the hydrophilic gelling agent on the drug release rate was investigated.  Increasing the concentration of the gelling agent in the formulation resulted in a slower rate of release.  The drug release data were modelled using the Higuchi relationship and a power law relationship to compare the effects of the various parameters on the release rate  Stability studies on the drug in the in situ gelling matrix system were carried out by storing samples in accelerated ageing conditions of 40 C / 75% relative humidity for 4 weeks.  During this time, the samples were analysed each week by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).  These demonstrated that no apparent drug degradation had occurred over the 4-week period. This indicates that the drug propranolol in the in situ gelling matrix system is stable under ambient conditions for at least 4 weeks.  The results of this study demonstrated that the in situ gelling matrix technology is potentially viable as a drug delivery system and provide a practical methodology for the commercial development of such systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Controlled Release Drug Delivery</field><field name="subject">Parenteral</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2590</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Low Intensity Conflict: Contemporary Approaches and Strategic Thinking</field><field name="creator">Searle, Deane</field><field name="description">Low Intensity Conflict (LIC) is a significant feature of the contemporary world and it is a particular challenge to the armed forces of many states which are involved is such conflict, or are likely to become so.  This thesis is not concerned with how such difficult conflict situations arise.  Rather it is concerned with how, from the point of view of the state, they may be contained and ultimately brought to a satisfactory resolution.  The work is thus concerned with the practicalities of ending LIC.  More specifically, the purpose of this research is to establish a framework of doctrinal and military principles applicable to the prevention and resolution of LIC.	The principles of this thesis are based in numerous historical examples of LIC and six in depth case studies.  These distilled principles are analysed in two central chapters, and are then applied in two latter defence force chapters so as to ensure there practicality and resilience.  Numerous defence academics and military practitioners have been consulted in the production of this thesis; their contribution has further reinforced the functionality of the principles examined in this research.	The research illustrates the criticality of a holistic approach to LIC.  The function of this approach is to guarantee the stability of the sovereign state, by unifying civil, police, intelligence and military services.  The effectiveness of the military elements must also be ensured, as military force is central to the suppression of LIC.  Consequently, the research makes strategic and operational prescriptions, so as to improve the capability of defence forces that are concerned with preventing or resolving LIC.</field><field

name="title">Social knowledge of food: How and why people talk about foods</field><field name="creator">Miyazaki, Yoshihiko</field><field name="description">Social knowledge about food was investigated from a social contingency perspective (Guerin, 1994, 1998, 2004), a functional linguistic approach that considers language use having functions both to establish 'facts' in order to control listeners, and to maintain social relationships with words.	In Study 1, whether people shared knowledge about food or not was examined.  One hundred and fourteen New Zealand and 23 Japanese participants were asked to answer free format questionnaires asking the reasons they and others eat or do not eat particular food items.  Those answers were categorised into 8 categories and 30 sub-categories of the knowledge about foods by qualitative content analysis.  The results of a cluster analysis of those categories showed that participants used the categories homogeneously although there were some differences between New Zealand and Japanese participants, and that the participants selectively used different types of knowledge according to food items especially when explaining why people do or do not eat some foods.	In Study 2, rhetorical features about foods were investigated: (1) numerical quantification rhetoric; (2) narrative use rhetoric; and (3) enumeration rhetoric.  Factual statements from a corpus of 118 New Zealand TV commercials and 249 Japanese TV commercials were coded by the categories generated in Study 1.  The results showed that the categories of factual statements were selectively used on TV commercials depending on the food types, and related closely to the results of Study 1.  The rhetorical strategies appeared in commercials according to the categories of factual statements.  When more than one factual statement was presented in a commercial, the relations of the factual statements were usually of a conjunctive form such as quotfact A however fact Bquot or quotfact A moreover fact Bquot, or else the factual statements were presented independently rather than the one statement logically warranting the other.  These results suggest that those rhetoric uses and the arrangements of the factual statements were selectively used according to the effectiveness against counter arguments using shared knowledge.	Study 3 and Study 4 analysed the functions of shared knowledge about food for maintaining social relationships through investigating the cases in which knowledge about foods presented as the form of 'collaborative talk', which occurs when one speaker completes the preceding saying by another speaker.	In Study 3, the collaborative talk as sentence completions of knowledge about food was qualitatively analysed from conversations of 30 to 45 minutes produced by four groups consisting of four or five Japanese participants who were friends.  From a social contingency view, the analysis focused on the following conversational properties: (1) who the listener was; (2) the degree of sharing of the information between the speakers; (3) the degree of sharing of the information between the 2nd speaker and the listener; and (4) the disagreement between the 2nd speaker and the listener. The results of Study 3 suggested some possible functions of sentence completions of knowledge about food: (1) the function when the first speaker is the listener may be enhancement of the relationship between the first and the second speakers through showing the second speaker's attention and understanding to the first speaker's utterance, because those sentence completions were often followed by the affirmation or negation by the first speaker; (2) when a third person is the listener, and the first and the second speaker refuted the third person using sentence completion, the function seems to be just establishing 'facts'; and (3) in the cases of 'assisted explaining' (Lerner  Takagi, 1999) , the function may be not only establishing 'facts' but also enhancement the relationship between the listener and the speakers, because the constructed 'facts' may work as a kind of conversational 'gift'.	In Study 4, five Japanese groups consisting of four participants who were friends were asked to talk about four topics about foods that all participants either agreed or disagreed ('All agree' condition) and four food topics for which there was disagreement about it between participants ('Some agree' condition).  When the listeners could not be identified, and the second speakers did not used the utterance-final element such as 'yo ne' that is regarded as having a function of showing agreement between the speakers, the participants used sentence completions more frequently in 'All agree' conditions.  The results suggested that the function of this type of sentence completion is not merely establishing 'facts' but also enhancing the relationship between the speakers through showing agreement about the relevant things to the topic.	In conclusion, the results of the present studies suggest some possible social contingencies involved both when people get knowledge about food and when they use it.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social contingency</field><field name="subject">social knowledge</field><field name="subject">social representation</field><field name="subject">verbal behaviour</field><field name="subject">discursive psychology</field><field name="subject">collaborative talk</field><field name="subject">food ritual</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2592</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of Hall currents, plasma viscosity and electron inertia on magnetic reconnection solutions</field><field name="creator">Senanayake, Tissa</field><field name="description">Abstract   This thesis examines magnetic reconnection in the solar corona. Magnetic reconnection is the only mechanism which allows the magnetic topology of magnetized  plasmas to be changed. Many of the dynamic processes in the Sun's atmosphere are believed to be  driven by magnetic reconnection and studying the behaviour of such phenomena is a key step to understanding the reconnection mechanism. In Chapters 1 to 3, we discuss the physical and mathematical framework on which current magnetohydrodynamic reconnection models are based.   The aim of the thesis is to investigate theoretical  models of magnetic reconnection using  variety of analytic  and numerical techniques within the theoretical frame work of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).  In Chapter 4 we use a line-tied X-point collapse model for compressible plasmas to investigate the role of viscosity on the energy release mechanism. This model also provides the basis for the investigation of Chapter 5 which explores the impact of Hall currents in the transient X-point energy dissipation.  Chapter 6 is concerned with how reconnection is modified in the presence of generalized Ohm's law which  includes both Hall current and electron inertia contributions. In contrast to the  closed  X-point collapse geometry adopted for compressible plasmas previously, we find it more convenient to explore this problem using an  open  incompressible geometry in which plasma is continually entering and exiting  the reconnection region. Specially, we find the scaling of the Hall-MHD system size analytically, rather than numerically as in the X-point problem of Chapter 5. Chapter 7 summarizes the results of investigations in Chapters 4, 5 and 6.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Magnetic reconnection</field><field name="subject">MHD</field><field name="subject">Solar Physics</field><field name="subject">Viscosity</field><field name="subject">Hall current</field><field name="subject">Electron inertia</field><field name="subject">X-point collapse</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Terrorism, war and international law: the legality of the use of force against Afghanistan in 2001</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Myra Elsie Jane Bell</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the international law pertaining to the use of force by states, in general, and to the use of force in self-defence, in particular.  The main question addressed is whether the use of force, which was purported to be in self-defence, by the United States, the United Kingdom and their allies against al Qaeda, the Taliban and Afghanistan, beginning on 7 October 2001, was lawful.  The thesis focuses not only on this specific use of force, but also on the changing nature of conflict, the definition of terrorism and on the historical evolution of limitations on the use of force, from antiquity until 2006.  In the six chapters which trace the epochs of international law, the progression of five inter-related concepts is followed: limitations on the resort to force generally, the use of force in self-defence, pre-emptive self-defence, the use of forcible measures short of war, and the use of force in response to non-state actors.  This historical analysis includes a particular emphasis on understanding the meaning of the 'inherent right of self-defence', which was preserved by Article 51 of the United Nations' Charter.  This analysis is then applied to the use of force against Afghanistan which occurred in 2001.  Following the terrorist attacks of 11 September, the US and the UK notified the United Nations Security Council of their resort to force in self-defence under Article 51.  Each element of Article 51 is analysed and the thesis concludes that there are significant doubts as to the lawfulness of that decision to employ force.  In addition to the self-defence justification, other possible grounds for intervention are also examined, such as humanitarian intervention, Security Council authorisation and intervention by invitation.  This thesis challenges the common assumption that the use of force against Afghanistan was an example of states exercising their inherent right to self-defence.  It argues that if this particular use of force is not challenged, it will lead to an expansion of the right of self-defence which will hinder rather than enhance international peace and security.  Finally, this thesis draws on recent examples to illustrate the point that the use of force against Afghanistan could become a dangerous precedent for the use of force in self-defence.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">United Nations' Security Council</field><field name="subject">United Nations' General Assembly</field><field name="subject">opinio juris</field><field name="subject">extradite or prosecute</field><field name="subject">aut dedere aut judicare</field><field name="subject">North Atlantic Treaty Organisation</field><field name="subject">NATO</field><field name="subject">preambular paragraphs</field><field name="subject">operative paragraphs</field><field name="subject">anticipatory self-defence</field><field name="subject">preemptive self-defence</field><field name="subject">pre-emptive self-defence</field><field name="subject">preemption</field><field name="subject">self-defense</field><field name="subject">self defense</field><field name="subject">conflict data</field><field name="subject">Security Council Resolution 1368 (2001)</field><field name="subject">Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001)</field><field name="subject">terrorism trends</field><field name="subject">United Nations Draft Convention on International Terrorism</field><field name="subject">just war</field><field name="subject">Pact of Paris</field><field name="subject">Kellogg-Briand Treaty</field><field name="subject">Treaty of Westphalia</field><field name="subject">Covenant of the League of Nations</field><field name="subject">definition of aggression</field><field name="subject">changin nature of conflict</field><field name="subject">President George W Bush</field><field name="subject">Prime Minister Tony Blair</field><field name="subject">Prime Minister John Howard</field><field name="subject">international reaction to terrorism</field><field name="subject">9/11</field><field name="subject">11 September 2001</field><field name="subject">September 11.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2594</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Professional development of ICT integration for secondary school teachers in Hong Kong: Towards a peer support enhanced model</field><field name="creator">Lee, Theodore Tai Hoi</field><field name="description">Although information and communication technology (ICT) has gradually become a standard teaching technology in schools in many countries and regions like Hong Kong, the implementation of ICT in teaching and learning in schools still fails to meet high government and public expectations.  This study was an investigation into the potential of peer support to enhance professional development of ICT integration for secondary school teachers in Hong Kong.  The study utilized peer support as a social approach to professional development and employed action research to examine the experiences of ten secondary school teachers who worked in five peer support groups for sixteen months.  A peer support model was introduced to the participants who then applied these principles in their own contexts.  Data on participants' reflections and evaluations of the peer support process was collected through individual interviews and peer-group conferences.  Each participant was interviewed at the beginning, middle and end of the research period and each peer group was interviewed at the end of the project.  By employing a grounded theory approach, themes related to the participants' experiences of peer support for ICT integration and the impact of peer support as a means of professional development were generated from the data.  The study's findings indicate that the participants responded positively to peer support as a means of professional development.  Peer support was successful in: increasing professional interactions; broadening perspectives of ICT; increasing reflection; and providing personal and emotional support. From an analysis of the study's findings, in conjunction with a review of the appropriate literature, a teacher professional development model for ICT integration has been developed that may be helpful in furthering the goal of successful ICT integration.  This model focuses on the importance of intrinsic motivation rather than extrinsic incentives and is based on a developmental process in which individual teachers determine their own practice through peer support enhanced critical reflection that continually expands their personal context of ICT integration.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">professional devleopment</field><field name="subject">ICT integration</field><field name="subject">peer support</field><field name="subject">secondary school teacher</field><field name="subject">Hong Kong</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the Journalistic Field:The Influence of Objectivity as a Journalistic Norm on the Public Debate on Genetic Engineering in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rupar, Verica</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the relationship between journalism as a specific type of socio-cultural practice and the production of meaning in public discussion. Through a case study of newspaper coverage of the issue of genetic engineering in New Zealand (2001-2002), it specifically examines journalists' newsgathering methods, their use of sources and their story-telling frames, and analyses how the news media uses the norm of objectivity to shape public debate on contentious issues. The study argues that elements and structures of journalistic practice both determine a newspaper's ability to address events and issues in a meaningful way and define a newspaper's potential to create a space for public debate. Drawing on field theory, discourse studies and the sociology of journalism, the thesis develops a new operational framework for investigation of journalistic practice by looking at the ideal of objectivity as a method of news gathering, an account of representing reality, and an attitude towards the reality so constructed. This framework is applied in the case study of newspaper coverage of the GE issue where four components of journalistic practice are analysed: journalistic form, transparency of newsgathering, sources and frame. Using content analysis, discourse analysis, interviews and a survey, the thesis explores the relationship between journalistic norms around these elements of the practice and the discursive potential of the news text to represent, interpret and construct reality.  The findings of this study highlight the tension between outmoded forms of practice and the complexity of issues in the public domain. The analysis reveals how the norm of objectivity, originally developed as a shield for the defence of the autonomy of the profession to mediate reality, became, in the case of media coverage of genetic engineering, an obstacle in extending journalism's potential to contribute to public debate. As a method, objectivity failed to provide a set of transparent protocols for the representation of the issue in the public arena; as an account, it reflected the impossibility of separating 'facts' from 'views' and positions of detachment from those of partisanship; and as an attitude, objectivity was endangered by the increasing power of economic imperatives in the production of news.  Following this analysis, the thesis explores the influence of journalistic norms on public debate by looking at journalism as a text, as a discursive practice and as a field of cultural production.  The GE issue, constructed in the New Zealand press as a key component of the 'knowledge economy', drew attention to the dynamics between the economic imperatives and professional standards of the journalistic field.  The objectivity norm was reduced in news reports to reporting 'what people say' rather than what the issue or argument meant, which led to a simplification of the genetic engineering issue in the public domain. The study concludes with the call for a re-examination of the journalistic field in light of the press's incapacity to challenge the status quo and map the social world for its readers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Journalism</field><field name="subject">objectivity</field><field name="subject">field theory</field><field name="subject">genetic engineering</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Occupational Stress in Academic life: A Study of Academics of Malaysian Public Universities</field><field name="creator">Idris, Mohd Kamel</field><field name="description">Stress can lead to poor health and loss of productivity among employees across occupations. Stress does not only affect individuals but also organizations by causing work absence and staff turnover. Academics in Malaysian public universities are no exception. Due to the rapid developments in tertiary education, academics in Malaysian public universities are believed to be experiencing increased job demands that potentially lead to increased stress. This study was carried out to examine: i) the direct effect of role stressors (i.e. role overload, role ambiguity and role conflict) on strain; ii) the direct effect of strain on the outcomes of strain (i.e. cynicism, professional efficacy, and organizational commitment); iii) the moderation effects of organizational support, peer support, and self-efficacy on the relationships between role stressors and strain; iv) the mediation effect of strain on the relationship between role stressors and strain; and v) the mediation effect of outcomes of strain (i.e. cynicism, professional efficacy, and organizational commitment) on the relationship between strain and intention to leave among those academics. This study used a non-experimental two-wave panel design. Eleven of the 12 study variables were measured using pre-existing scales except for self-efficacy, iii which was measured by items specially developed for this study. A longitudinal survey with a six-month time interval yielded 357 respondents (academics) at time 1 and 210 respondents at time 2. Data were analyzed using multiple regression, hierarchical regression, and structural equation modeling (SEM) to test for direct effects, moderation effects and mediation effects respectively. The findings of this study indicate that academics who experienced increased levels of role stressors were more likely to have increased levels of strain. Subsequently, the strained academics were more likely to show higher levels of cynicism and lower levels of professional efficacy and organizational commitment. The predicted moderators (i.e organizational support, peer support, and self-efficacy) had no significant influence on the relationships between role stressors and strain. Mediation analyses consisted of two parts. In the first part, I found that strain strongly mediated the relationship between role ambiguity and outcomes of strain (i.e. cynicism, professional efficacy, and organizational commitment). In the subsequent mediation analysis, I found that cynicism and organizational commitment fully mediated the relationship between strain and intention to leave, but not professional efficacy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">occupational stress</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">universities</field><field name="subject">academic stress</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kaupapa M&#257;ori Science</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Georgina Marjorie</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates how M&#257;ori knowledge and language articulate with current discourses of P&#363;taiao education, and possible alternative articulations. A Kaupapa M&#257;ori version of critical discourse analysis methodology is developed and applied to discourses relevant to P&#363;taiao, or M&#257;ori-medium science education. This topic represents an intersection between language, science, education, and culture - fields which are all highly politically charged. Therefore, it is essential that a politically robust Kaupapa M&#257;ori position be taken in relation to the research topic. Not only the issues being investigated but the underlying research paradigm must be interrogated using Kaupapa M&#257;ori theory at each stage of the project.  The goal is to study the range of possible meanings for the notions of 'P&#363;taiao' and 'M&#257;ori science' by exploring the relevant dialectical issues, critiquing the assumptions and positions taken on language, knowledge, identity and ethos, in order to inform further P&#363;taiao curriculum development. The research project is a narration of the larger story of P&#363;taiao education: what is the current situation, how did it come about, what theoretical issues have been influential in this process, and what possibilities are there for further development of P&#363;taiao curriculum and pedagogy? The thesis research consists of a series of discourse analyses of varying levels of focus and intersection with P&#363;taiao: W&#257;hanga 1: Translated NCEA L1 science and mathematics examinations, and a traditional Taitokerau oral text; W&#257;hanga 2: M&#257;ori science curriculum policy; W&#257;hanga 3: Multicultural science education research; W&#257;hanga 4: Curriculum politics, preventive linguistics, language of science; W&#257;hanga 5: M&#257;tauranga, rationality, philosophy of science.  Each analysis takes the form of a narrative history, based on a selected corpus of previously published scholarship (in W&#257;hanga 1, including numerical data and oral tradition) on the issue under examination, from a Kaupapa M&#257;ori perspective. Mainly in the first two chapters, analysis at times also draws on 'personal narrative' accounts of previously unpublished details relating to P&#363;taiao. Additionally, an investigation of various qualified notions of 'science' is undertaken, beginning in W&#257;hanga 2, concluding in W&#257;hanga 5, in order to explore the nature and boundaries of science as a system of knowledge, and its relationship to other types or systems of knowledge. Synopses are included of the following concepts and theoretical issues impacting on the discourses under analysis: W&#257;hanga 1: Ethnicity, 'race', critical theory, Kaupapa M&#257;ori theory. W&#257;hanga 2: Science, scientism, science ideology and anti-science. W&#257;hanga 4: Identity, linguistic purism, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.  Informed by this research, in W&#257;hanga 5 an original model for the relationship between m&#257;tauranga and science is proposed, and the notion of Kaupapa M&#257;ori science/epistemology is explored. An analogy between the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and multicultural science is used to draw together the cultural debates in language and knowledge, which are surmised to intersect at the level of discourse. The final chapter presents a re-articulation of P&#363;taiao as the notion of Kaupapa M&#257;ori science education, and some recommendations for language and content knowledge in further development of P&#363;taiao curriculum policy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">science education</field><field name="subject">indigenous knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2598</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards an Understanding of Existing e-Learning for University Science Education in Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Wang, Su-Chen</field><field name="description">E-learning is a fast growing trend worldwide but it is still not universally accepted and practice does not always reach national government and tertiary institution expectations, especially in Taiwan. While issues around the effective implementation of e-learning to produce high quality education are being raised internationally, very little research has been undertaken in Taiwanese tertiary institutions, particularly for science education. No research was found that addressed the various perspectives of the stakeholders involved in blended courses which had both face-to-face and online learning components. The link between e-learning practice and views of learning had also received little attention.  This study investigated how e-learning practice was perceived and experienced at a national research-based university in Taiwan. The main focus was to identify the challenges, benefits and related success factors of e-learning practice as part of blended learning courses from the perspectives of university administrators, support people, instructors and students. An interpretative methodology using questionnaires and interviews was employed to generate data from these participant groups. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. This study provides empirical evidence that e-learning practice is perceived and experienced as a technology-mediated and collaborative practice that is socially and culturally situated. The study supports the view that e-learning practice as a whole is a socio-cultural system, although when looking at instructor and student preferences for instructional design and learning processes there is a fit with both behaviorist and constructivist approaches to teaching and learning. However, instructors and students need to be active and self-managed to find e-learning efficient and effective. Students, instructors, support people and administrators held very similar perceptions of the benefits of and influences on lecturer and student use of e-learning as a component of blended learning.  Based on the findings, an explanatory model for the influences on e-learning practice as part of blended learning in a Taiwan university context was developed. E-learning teaching and learning approaches are initiated by and created within a multi-layered context. At the first level, e-learning practice is accomplished via instructor and student engagement in day to day teaching and learning and as an educational reform it cannot separated from the ICT technologies which mediate their interaction. Put another way, because instructor and student participation in e-learning as part of blended learning is voluntary students are included with instructors and the technology in the core enactment zone for practice. At the next level this three-way instructor-student-technology interaction is affected by and nested within the university instructor professional community and student peer community, which in turn is shaped by and nested in university-wide policies and practices. These three levels are nested in and influenced by the national policy context, external professionals, private enterprise and the public at large.  The model and associated suggestions presented in this study are expected to assist governments and universities to play a more constructive role in the development and implementation of e-learning education to improve the quality of courses for students and instructors. The hope is that the findings will contribute to enhanced teaching and learning supported by better administrator decision-making regarding institutional policies and practices including investment in learning technologies and support services for e-learning.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">e-learning</field><field name="subject">blended learning</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">ICT</field><field name="subject">science education</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="subject">learning theory</field><field name="subject">administrator</field><field name="subject">instructor</field><field name="subject">student</field><field name="subject">technical support</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2599</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Text Augmentation: Inserting markup into natural language text with PPM Models</field><field name="creator">Yeates, Stuart Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a new optimisation and new heuristics for automatically marking up XML documents, and CEM, a Java implementation, using PPM models.

Other corpora include the ROCLING Chinese text segmentation corpus, the Computists' Communique corpus and the Reuters' corpus.  A detailed examination is presented of the methods of evaluating mark up algorithms, including computation complexity measures and correctness measures from the fields of information retrieval, string processing, machine learning and information theory.  A new taxonomy of markup complexities is established and the properties of each taxon are examined in relation to the complexity of marked up documents.

Sites upstream and downstream of: geothermal; bleached kraft mill effluent (BKME); sewage and thermal point-source discharges were sampled. At each site, the population parameters, relative abundance, age structure and individual indices such as: condition factor; and organ (gonad, liver, and spleen) somatic weight ratios; and number and size of follicles per female were assessed. Indicators of fish residence and in some cases exposure to contaminants in discharges were analyzed. Bile chemistry of brown bullhead and shortfin eel was assayed, liver and muscle metal levels were analyzed for brown bullhead and shortfin eel respectively, and stable isotopes of C and N in common bully were measured. Bile, metal and isotopic signatures gave strong evidence that fish had been resident at sites for some time before sampling. Signatures of bile and metal contaminants showed contamination was localised to discharge areas. Gradients in stable isotopes in common bully showed evidence of changes in water sources and anthropogenic effects along the river. Biochemical variables, hepatic ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and plasma steroids indicated exposure and response of brown bullhead and shortfin eel to pulp and paper contaminants at the BKME site. Physiological (blood) variables showed fish largely responded in a predictable way to elevated water temperatures at discharge sites at time of sampling, however total haemoglobin of brown bullhead and common bully blood failed to increase at the BKME site despite elevated temperatures and low dissolved oxygen. Growth rates, condition factor, age structure, and gonadosomatic index (GSI) suggest that discharges with significant heat or nutrients benefit brown bullhead despite physiological impairment at the BKME site. Shortfin eel individuals also benefited from heated water discharges. No consistent impacts on common bully health were obvious at individual discharge sites, or cumulatively along the river due to the gradual deterioration in water quality downstream. Common bully individuals also benefited from heat in discharges but lack of juveniles at sites where numerous juvenile brown bullhead were found, suggest that unlike brown bullhead populations, common bully populations were not responding with significant recruitment. Although I found little evidence of toxic effects of discharges on shortfin eel, caution is required in assessing the potential of contaminants to impact eel populations due to the life history of shortfin eel, and exploited nature of populations. For example, reproductive damage suffered by adult eels may not immediately manifest itself in the effected population due to temporal delays in gonadal maturation, and recruitment, and single panmictic populations supplementing recruitment of impacted populations. Distinct changes in population parameters at each of the paired sites and changes in individual variables showed that fish responded to discharges. The range of responses in species suggests different sensitivity to contaminants and amount of benefit which each species receives from heat in discharges. In these terms shortfin eel would be the most resistant, then brown bullhead and lastly common bully. Interpretation of population-level impacts at the geothermal and BKME discharge sites is made difficult due to benefits of additional heat. There is also the possibility that detection of sub-lethal or chronic effects on sensitive juvenile life-stages may be being hidden by compensatory density population responses. Responses and life history of common bully made them the preferred indicator species of the three species sampled, and supported overseas examples using small-bodied fish species as sentinels.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fish health</field><field name="subject">population</field><field name="subject">pollution</field><field name="subject">metal</field><field name="subject">BKME</field><field name="subject">pulp and paper</field><field name="subject">Ameiurus</field><field name="subject">Anguilla</field><field name="subject">Gobiomorphus</field><field name="subject">geothermal</field><field name="subject">municipal waste</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Syntax-driven argument identification and multi-argument classification for semantic role labeling</field><field name="creator">Lin, Chi-San Althon</field><field name="description">Semantic role labeling is an important stage in systems for Natural Language Understanding.  The basic problem is one of identifying who did what to whom for each predicate in a sentence.  Thus labeling is a two-step process: identify constituent phrases that are arguments to a predicate, then label those arguments with appropriate thematic roles.  Existing systems for semantic role labeling use machine learning methods to assign roles one-at-a-time to candidate arguments.  There are several drawbacks to this general approach.  First, more than one candidate can be assigned the same role, which is undesirable.  Second, the search for each candidate argument is exponential with respect to the number of words in the sentence.  Third, single-role assignment cannot take advantage of dependencies known to exist between semantic roles of predicate arguments, such as their relative juxtaposition.  And fourth, execution times for existing algorithm are excessive, making them unsuitable for real-time use.  This thesis seeks to obviate these problems by approaching semantic role labeling as a multi-argument classification process.  It observes that the only valid arguments to a predicate are unembedded constituent phrases that do not overlap that predicate.  Given that semantic role labeling occurs after parsing, this thesis proposes an algorithm that systematically traverses the parse tree when looking for arguments, thereby eliminating the vast majority of impossible candidates.   Moreover, instead of assigning semantic roles one at a time, an algorithm is proposed to assign all labels simultaneously; leveraging dependencies between roles and eliminating the problem of duplicate assignment.  Experimental results are provided as evidence to show that a combination of the proposed argument identification and multi-argument classification algorithms outperforms all existing systems that use the same syntactic information.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Semantic Role Labeling</field><field name="subject">SRL</field><field name="subject">Predicate-Argument Recognition Algorithm</field><field name="subject">PARA</field><field name="subject">Multi-Argument Classification</field><field name="subject">MAC</field><field name="subject">Pattern-Matching</field><field name="subject">PM</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2602</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Symbolic order and material agency: A cultural ecology of native forest remnants on Waikato dairy farms</field><field name="creator">Jay, Grace Mairi M</field><field name="description">Loss of native biological diversity is a world-wide problem of growing international concern.  One of the main causes of native biodiversity loss is destruction and degradation of native habitat through land development for agriculture.  The Waikato region is an example of the destruction and degradation of native habitat in association with the development and intensification of farming, including dairy farming.  This thesis explores cultural reasons for the loss of native forest in the Waikato region, and reasons why fragments of native forest remain.  The research involves a participant observation study of 'typical' dairy farm families for 9 months of the dairy year, in-depth interviews of dairy farmers who have protected a significant proportion of their land for conservation of native habitat, a questionnaire of dairy farmers, and an examination of dairy farm magazines and other literature to identify the values and attitudes that motivate dairy farmers in relation to land management and protection of native habitat.  The title of the thesis suggests two elements that are important for understanding the loss and persistence of native forest in Waikato's farmed landscapes.  Symbolic reason refers to the values, attitudes and perceptions of farmers that derive from socio-political and economic forces which encourage productivist practises that leave little opportunity for native forest to survive.  Material agency refers to the local circumstances of particular farms and individual people which enable native forest to persist.   The thesis argues that persistence of native forest depends on the idiosyncrasies of material circumstance in the face of relentless pressure to transform the production landscape for economic purposes.  The thesis concludes with a suggestion that policies to assist survival of native habitat in farmed landscapes need to include ones that encourage the odds in favour of fortuitous circumstance.  In the face of globalised economic pressures, policies for conservation of native biodiversity need to involve a 'portfolio' of measures that apply to individual landowners and the wider rural community by recognising, assisting and rewarding management for non-production values.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">dairy  farming</field><field name="subject">farming</field><field name="subject">native vegetation</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">actor-networks</field><field name="subject">political ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmentally Sustainable Aquaculture: An Eco-Physical Perspective</field><field name="creator">Longdill, Peter</field><field name="description">The New Zealand aquaculture industry during the late 1990s and early 2000s experienced a significant and sustained period of growth.  Greenshell mussels (Perna canaliculus) are proving to be a popular and valuable cultured species, with large domestic and international markets.  Traditionally, these bivalves have been farmed within enclosed embayments and on relatively small scales (~3 Ha).  The recent expansion of the industry coupled with the near saturation of existing 'traditional' sites and new culture technologies has led the industry toward alternate environments, notably exposed offshore sites.  Initial proposals within the Bay of Plenty have included multiple farms of ~4500 Ha each.  This novel approach to shellfish culture created uncertainty with respect to potential environmental impacts, cumulative effects, and sustainable carrying capacities within these exposed open-coast locations.  In zoning for Aquaculture Management Areas (AMAs), environmental managers must be informed of each of these aspects to ensure the rational and sustainable use of the coastal-marine space.  The overall goal of this study is to determine the potential for environmentally sustainable large-scale offshore mussel culture within the Bay of Plenty marine environment.  The long term sustainability of aquaculture development on an open coast is a function of many influences which can vary in both time and space.  The benthic environments of the Bay of Plenty exhibit great variability in their ability to assimilate waste inputs from suspended mussel culture; a direct function of the variability in sedimentary environments and benthic habitats within the region.  Specifically, silty sediments with low natural organic contents, generally found between 40 and 100 m depths are the most suitable locations for sustainable mussel aquaculture from an environmental impact perspective.  Both observations and model predictions indicate productivity potential within the region to be greatest within neritic zones of the western Bay of Plenty.  Local wind forcing is the predominant mechanism forcing local shelf currents.  Current meter data and numerical modelling tests from this study indicate that local winds explain the majority of water current variability on the shelf, generate the delivery of new nutrients to the shelf through upwelling, and hence create the variability in productivity potential.  Complicating the AMA zoning process for environmental managers, however, are existing uses of, and societal values toward, the coastal-marine environment.  GIS planning tools have been shown to be effective at minimising conflicts and maximising sustainability potential through informed site selection.  Within the Bay of Plenty, these preferential sites are located on the mid-shelf (60-80 m depths) offshore from Pukehina, Matata, and Whakatane.  This study shows that the simulated cumulative lower trophic-level depletion impacts of two large (~5000 Ha) proposed offshore mussel farms vary seasonally as a result of subtle changes in ecosystem dynamics and mussel feeding patterns.  At proposed stocking densities, largest relative impacts are expected during autumn and winter, when relative phytoplankton biomass is low and growth rates slow.  During spring, while absolute impacts are greater than those during autumn/winter, greater phytoplankton-zooplankton biomass and faster growth rates result in quicker recovery times and reduced 'depletion halo' extents.  Year-long predicted impacts are below those applied as 'acceptable limits of change', both within New Zealand and internationally, indicative of the ecological carrying capacity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bay of Plenty</field><field name="subject">aquaculture</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">mussel</field><field name="subject">greenshell</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A composer-teacher in context: Music for the performing arts faculty in a New Zealand secondary school</field><field name="creator">Jennings, Janet</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the processes and outcomes of a composer-teacher's practice in the context of a New Zealand secondary school.  The research was undertaken by the composer-teacher/researcher as a case study that integrates an investigation of the context with four action research music composition projects developed as a creative response to that context.  Chapters One to Three comprise the background theory.  Chapter One provides an introduction and overview of the research; Chapter Two explains and justifies the research methods.  Chapter Three peels away and examines five layers of the secondary school context identified as significant in shaping the perceptions of the participants: approaching the context in a multi-layered way enabled coherent synthesis and appraisal of the relevant literature.  Chapters Four to Seven comprise the four action research music composition projects.  Each action research project focuses on a music score composed by the composer-teacher/researcher for a specific group of students at Macleans College, Auckland.  The composition, production, and performance processes are investigated from the perspectives of all the participants.  Each music project comprises a four part progression - plan (composition process), data (music score), data analysis (recordings of performances, surveys, and interviews with all participants) and reflection (feedback, and feedforward into the next project). Each phase of the research generated significant outcomes, such as the four original music scores.  Chapter Eight summarizes the themes, issues, and patterns that emerged, and makes recommendations for further research.  A model of co-constructive practice emerges from this research: teacher and students co-construct artistic worlds through performance.  The model is not new (it is common practice, adopted by generations of musician-teachers) but is rarely acknowledged and currently un-researched.  This research demonstrates the validity of the practice from both musical, and teaching and learning perspectives, and examines the strengths and limitations of the model.  At its best, the creative processes co-constructed by a teacher with her students are shown to provide a crucible within which intense and creative learning experiences occur.  Students of all levels of ability are shown to gain confidence in this context, and subsequently develop skills with apparent ease.  The co-constructive model is limited in that it cannot meet the musical needs of all students: co-construction should be considered as one model of practice, appropriate for use in association with many others.  This research provides 'virtual access' to a particular world of performance practice, revealing the secondary school context as a realm of authentic and valid musical practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">composer-teacher</field><field name="subject">praxial philosophy</field><field name="subject">artistic inquiry; co-construction</field><field name="subject">co-curricular</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Absorptive capacity and internationalization of New Zealand high-tech SMEs in the agro-technology sector</field><field name="creator">Sedoglavich, Vesna</field><field name="description">This study investigates the relationships between firm's technology, absorptive capacity and the internationalization process in the high-tech SMEs. The research identifies the most influential factors that affect the international activities and expansion decisions of New Zealand high-tech SMEs with core capabilities in agro-technology.  Mixed methods, qualitative and quantitative elements in the data collection and analysis, were employed in this research for a reason that a deeper understanding of the research subject and the analysis of complex issues such as the internationalization process and absorptive capacity required methodological variety. The use of qualitative and quantitative methods took place in parallel. Both methods were used to study the same subject but they had specific objective related purposes and they offered the possibility of developing rich empirical data as well as a more comprehensive understanding of the subject under the study. The findings show that it is absorptive capacity that explains internationalization process, not internationalization process that explains absorptive capacity. The practice of internationalizing is as much a reflection of a firm's absorptive capacity as it is its determinant. The research identifies that high-tech SMEs possess technological and non-core absorptive capacity which in a different way influence firms' strategies. The research suggests that firm's technological capabilities and the advantage of specialized knowledge along with their limited non-core absorptive capacity act as constraints to the development of the future international strategy in high-tech SMEs.  The study expands the existing literature on internationalization by developing variables for evaluating absorptive capacity in firms. This helped develop an absorptive capacity model which can be used as a valuable tool for self-assessment by firms to facilitate gaining insight towards further growth and development. The research suggested that if firms were able to measure its absorptive capacity this may result in improved business activities and enhanced presence in the world market. The results of this study should encourage firms to identify, capture and articulate knowledge achieved by their ventures. Managers must develop and nurture skills that ensure effective integration of learning as their firms expand, particularly internationally. These findings and absorptive capacity model offered as a tool should encourage managers to explore when, where, and how to best use firm's resources in the business operations. This is particularly important in regards to the research context (high-tech SMEs) where scientists are managers as well.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">absorptive capacity</field><field name="subject">technology transfer</field><field name="subject">internationalization</field><field name="subject">absorptive capacity measurement</field><field name="subject">fuzzy logic</field><field name="subject">Karnaugh map</field><field name="subject">absorptive capacity variables</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Block-Based Distributed File Systems</field><field name="creator">McGregor, Anthony James</field><field name="description">Distributed file systems have become popular because they allow information to be shared be between computers in a natural way.  A distributed file system often forms a central building block in a distributed system.  Currently most distributed file systems are built using a communications interface that transfers messages about files between machines.  This thesis proposes a different, lower level, communications interface.  This `block-based' interface exchanges information about the blocks that make up the file but not about the files themselves.  No other distributed file system is built this way.  By demonstrating that a distributed file system can be implemented in a block-based manner, this thesis opens the way for many advances in distributed file systems.  These include a reduction of the processing required at the server, uniformity in managing file blocks and fine-grained placement and replication of data. The simple communications model also lends itself to efficient implementation both at the server and in the communications protocols that support the interface.  These advantages come at the cost of a more complex client implementation and the need for a lower level consistency mechanism.  A block-based distributed file system (BB-NFS) has been implemented. BB-NFS provides the Unix file system interface and demonstrates the feasibility and implementability of the block-based approach. Experience with the implementation lead to the development of a lock cache mechanism which gives a large improvement in the performance of the prototype.  Although it has not been directly measured it is plausible that the prototype will perform better than the file based approach.  The block-based approach has much to offer future distributed file system developers.  This thesis introduces the approach and its advantages, demonstrates its feasibility and shows that it can be implemented in a way that performs well.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Distributed file systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bioactive Chemicals of Importance in Endophyte-Infected Grasses</field><field name="creator">Babu, Jacob</field><field name="description">Janthitrems are believed to be involved in the observed sporadic cases of AR37- infected perennial ryegrass staggers. Investigations into the role of janthitrems in perennial ryegrass staggers are difficult as isolation of the compounds from the ryegrass is hindered by the inherent instability of these compounds. Therefore attempts were made to isolate janthitrems from an alternative source, allowing these janthitrem analogues to be used as surrogates for endophyte produced janthitrems. Analysis of a series of Penicillium janthinellum cultures revealed the presence of janthitrems in a number of strains, including janthitrem B, janthitrem C and two novel janthitrem compounds. Detailed one- and two-dimensional NMR and mass spectral techniques identified the two novel compounds as 11,12- epoxyjanthitrems B and C, which were subsequently given the trivial names janthitrems A and D, respectively. Janthitrems B and C were isolated and identified by NMR and revisions of some previously reported chemical shift assignments were proposed. In addition to the janthitrems, penitrems were also identified in two strains of P. janthinellum. The isolated janthitrem B was utilised for the development of efficient extraction procedures, and for the determination of ideal storage conditions for janthitrem compounds. A method for the extraction and isolation of janthitrem B from a P. janthinellum culture was developed and optimised to yield 6 mg of janthitrem B from 900 mL of fungal culture in two days. Stability studies of janthitrem B indicated the ideal storage condition which minimised degradation was dry at &#8722;80 C where only 7% sample loss was observed over 300 days. Bioactivity studies of janthitrems A and B found these compounds to be tremorgenic to mice, with janthitrem A (an epoxyjanthitrem) inducing more severe tremors than janthitrem B. Insect testing also showed that both janthitrems A and B displayed anti-insect activity to porina larvae. Since the epoxyjanthitrems, which are associated with AR37 endophyte-infected ryegrass, were also shown to be tremorgenic and to display anti-insect activity, the insect resistance and the sporadic cases of ryegrass staggers displayed by AR37 may be related to the presence of epoxyjanthitrem compounds. LC-UV-MS analysis of janthitrems A-D, penitrems A-F, lolitrem B, paspalinine, paxilline and terpendole C found these indole-diterpenoids to be more sensitive by analysis using an APCI source as opposed to an ESI source. APCI negative ion LC-UV-MS required source induced dissociation in combination with increased collision energy to suppress an acetate adduct peak, sourced from the acetic acid buffer. Negative ion MS2 and MS3 data produced more informative fragments compared to the conventional positive ion MS2 and MS3 data. The availability of both positive and negative ion LC-UV-MS methodologies will allow future endophyte products to be more thoroughly screened for different classes of secondary metabolites. Extracts of mouldy walnuts were analysed for the presence of tremorgenic mycotoxins after a dog was found to exhibit symptoms characteristic of tremorgenic mycotoxicosis. LC-UV-MS analysis of the mouldy walnuts identified the tremorgenic mycotoxins penitrems A-F, thus confirming the veterinarian's tentative diagnosis of canine tremorgenic mycotoxicosis   the first reported case in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">indole-diterpenoids</field><field name="subject">janthitrems</field><field name="subject">ryegrass staggers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating the Effectiveness of Conformance-Based Plans: Attributing Built Heritage Outcomes to Plan Implementation Under New Zealand's Resource Management Act</field><field name="creator">Mason, Greg</field><field name="description">Little is known about the effectiveness of district plans in protecting built heritage, which is a matter of national importance under New Zealand's Resource Management Act 1991 (RMAct). This is despite the fact that the RMAct directs planning agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of plan provisions. This lack of evaluation is not unique to New Zealand or merely symptomatic of heritage planning. Instead, it is a shortcoming in planning theory and practice internationally; a well recognised impediment being that planning lacks a suitable evaluation approach. This thesis aims to address this deficiency by proposing a methodology for evaluating plan effectiveness and applying it to the built heritage provisions of two district plans.  The methodology adopted has been shaped by the theory-based and realist evaluation approaches, as developed in the field of programme evaluation. Both approaches share a common ontology regarding claims of causality, which stresses 'knowledge in context'. Thus, a central endeavour of the research is not only to identify the environmental outcomes arising from plan implementation, but also to understand how and why the implementation context promoted or inhibited the achievement of plan goals. In so doing, the causal and implementation theories underpinning the plans' heritage provisions are exposed, modelled and tested.  The findings reveal that plan implementation failed to prevent the loss of built heritage values in many instances. While the plans' causal theory was largely sound, key aspects of the implementation theory were not realised during the development control process. Plan quality was a significant factor, as was the commitment and capacity of developers to comply with the plans. The institutional fixation on consent processing speed rather than environmental outcomes was a further impediment. Overall, the theory-based approach provided a useful framework for determining plan effectiveness and holds promise for evaluating plan issues other than built heritage.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plan effectiveness</field><field name="subject">built heritage</field><field name="subject">resource management act</field><field name="subject">theory-based evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding and Enhancing Customer-Agent-Computer Interaction in Customer Service Settings</field><field name="creator">Olsson, Anette</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Providing good customer service is crucial to many commercial organizations. There are different means through which the service can be provided, such as Ecommerce, call centres or face-to-face. Although some service is provided through electronic or telephone-based interaction, it is common that the service is provided through human agents. In addition, many customer service interactions also involve a computer, for example, an information system where a travel agent finds suitable flights. This thesis seeks to understand the three channels of customer service interactions between the agent, customer and computer: Customer-Agent-Computer Interaction (CACI). A set of ethnographic studies were conducted at call centres to gain an initial understanding of CACI and to investigate the customer-computer channel. The findings revealed that CACI is more complicated than traditional CHI, because there is a second person, the customer, involved in the interaction. For example, the agent provides a lot of feedback about the computer to the customer, such as,  I am waiting for the computer . Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the customer-computer channel by adding non-verbal auditory feedback about the computer directly to the customers. The findings showed only a small insignificant difference in task completion time and subjective satisfaction. There were indications that there was an improvement in flow of communication. Experiments were conducted to investigate how the two humans interact over two different communication modes: face-to-face and telephone. Findings showed that there was a significantly shorter task completion time via telephone. There was also a difference in style of communication, with face-to-face having more single activities, such as, talking only, while in the telephone condition there were more dual activities, for instance talking while also searching. There was only a small difference in subjective satisfaction. To investigate if the findings from the laboratory experiment also held in a real situation and to identify potential improvement areas, a series of studies were conducted: observations and interviews at multiple travel agencies, one focus group and a proof of concept study at one travel agency. The findings confirmed the results from the laboratory experiments. A number of potential interface improvements were also identified, such as, a history mechanism and sharing part of the computer screen with the customer at the agent's discretion. The results from the work in this thesis suggest that telephone interaction, although containing fewer cues, is not necessarily an impoverished mode of communication. Telephone interaction is less time consuming and more task-focused. Further, adding non-verbal auditory feedback did not enhance the interaction. The findings also suggest that customer service CACI is inherently different in nature and that there are additional complications with traditional CHI issues.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer human interaction customer service</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining Capabilities: A Resource Based Model of ICT Advantage</field><field name="creator">Rastrick, Karyn Christine</field><field name="description">Significant levels of interest and organisational spending on information and communication technologies (ICT's) have triggered debate as to whether these investments are worthwhile.  While there has been some acknowledgement that investments result in positive returns, little is known about how ICT's may lead to competitive advantage.  This thesis starts to inform this gap, by investigating how ICT's are combined with other organisational resources in the context of an exemplar organisation.  The resource based view (RBV) is used as a framework to guide this study.  The RBV is an appropriate lens to guide this research due to its focus on resources and capabilities as sources of advantage.  This research employs an interpretive case study design based in an organisation with a long history of innovation and success with regard to ICT's.  A grounded integrated model of advantage is presented based on two distinct groupings of integrated capabilities: lifecycle and embedded foundational capabilities.  The integrated model of advantage, along with key actions outlined to support such capabilities, provides researchers and practitioners with a new way of understanding ICT based advantages.  In essence, this research demonstrates how the total ownership of ICT's, within the case studied, presents a potential advantage.  The advantage is realised through the combination of capabilities and the inclusive approach to ICT development employed in the case organisation.  The research finds support from propositions of the RBV, in that the model demonstrates sources of advantage are based on organisational capabilities which are valuable, firm specific, and socially complex.  As such, the integration of capabilities evident in the integrated model of advantage is a likely source of sustained competitive advantage.  This means advantages gained from the integration of capabilities are not easily imitated or competed away.  Furthermore, advantages have an even greater potential to be a source of sustained advantage than any single resource or capability.  The research has important implications for theory and practice.  While many individual sources of advantage have been empirically examined, this research provides one of the first in-depth case studies which identify integrated capabilities.  Understanding such sources of advantage will help practitioners better understand and protect key organisational capabilities to sustain or extend competitive advantages.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">resource based view</field><field name="subject">competitive advantage</field><field name="subject">combining capabilities</field><field name="subject">ICT</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of the Health Benefits of Honey as a Replacement For Sugar In the Diet</field><field name="creator">Chepulis, Lynne Merran</field><field name="description">Sugar (primarily sucrose) has been a part of the daily diet for literally hundreds of years, but research is now suggesting that sugar intake can be detrimental to our health. In particular, excessive consumption of simple sugars with high glycemic index (GI) values have been shown to cause overeating and weight gain. As well, elevated postprandial hyperglycemia can result after consuming sugars and this has been linked to disease formation and progression, the development of advanced glycation endproducts, inflammation and increased mortality rates. Honey has been recognised as having a number of beneficial health properties, including slower uptake into the bloodstream, a pharmacological action of reducing blood glucose levels and a high level of bioavailable antioxidants, all of which may mean that honey could be less harmful to health than sucrose in the diet. This study was therefore designed to investigate the health benefits of honey in the diet as a replacement for sucrose, using small animal studies. As well, because of the interest in using honey as a replacement for sucrose in sweetened dairy foods, a small number of in vitro investigations were carried out to determine whether honey could retain its bioactive properties when combined with milk/dairy products. Using the in vitro studies, it was shown that the combination of milk with honey had no effect on either the antibacterial or antioxidant capabilities of honey.	During the animal feeding studies a number of significant findings were observed. In the earlier work it was shown that honey had a significant effect on protein metabolism when fed for 14 days at a level of 600 g/kg diet (comprising 480 g sugars and 120 g water) compared with animals fed an equivalent amount of sucrose. In this study, honey-fed rats exhibited significantly lower weight gains (p less than 0.001), food intake (p less than 0.05) and nitrogen intakes (p less than 0.05) and significantly higher faecal nitrogen outputs (p less than 0.05) compared with sucrose-fed rats. Animals fed a diet consisting of 480 g/kg of mixed sugars as in honey generally exhibited protein metabolism parameters that were comparable to those of the sucrose-fed rats, suggesting that the effects of honey on protein metabolism were not due solely to its distinctive sugar composition.	Furthermore, in another study that specifically investigated the effects of honey on weight regulation, honey (100 g/kg diet) resulted in significantly reduced weight gain after 6 weeks (p less than 0.01) compared with animals fed the same amount of sugars as sucrose, although food intake was not reduced in this study. Percentage weight gains were shown to be comparable between honey-fed rats and those fed a sugar-free diet, suggesting that differences in glycemic control may be partly responsible for the results seen. Fasting lipid profiles and blood glucose levels were also measured in this study, but no significant differences were observed between diet groups.	During long-term (12 months) feeding weight gain was again significantly reduced in rats fed honey (p less than 0.05) and a sugar-free diet (p less than 0.01) compared with those fed sucrose, the weights of honey-fed rats and those fed the sugar-free diet being comparable at the end of the study. In addition, blood glucose levels were significantly lower (p less than 0.001), and HDL-cholesterol levels significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in animals fed honey compared with those fed sucrose after 52 weeks, but no differences in these parameters were observed between rats fed sucrose and a sugar-free diet. No other significant differences in lipid profiles were observed. Immunity measures were improved after feeding honey or sucrose for 52 weeks, animals in both of these diet groups having significantly higher levels of neutrophil phagocytosis compared with those fed the sugar-free diet (both p less than 0.0001). In addition, the percentage of leukocytes that were lymphocytes was significantly higher in honey-fed rats at the end of the study. Furthermore, levels of oxidative damage in aortic collagen were significantly reduced in rats fed honey or the sugar-free diet (both p less than 0.05) compared with those fed sucrose after 52 weeks.	Full body DEXA scans were also undertaken in this 12-month study to assess body fat levels and bone mineral composition and density, although they revealed few statistically significant differences. Percentage body fat levels were shown to be nearly 10% lower in honey-fed rats compared with sucrose-fed animals at the end of the study (p less than 0.05), but no other significant differences between diet groups were observed. With one exception, no differences in bone mineral composition or bone mineral density were observed between the three diet groups after 52 weeks. This data agreed with the results generated from two earlier studies that showed that feeding honey short-term (for 6-8 weeks) to rats that were either calcium-deficient or fed a low calcium diet had no effect on bone calcium levels, bone mineral content, bone mineral density or bone breaking parameters.	Lastly, long-term feeding of honey to rats had a number of statistically significant effects on anxiety and cognitive performance when assessed using animal maze tasks. Anxiety-like behaviour was significantly reduced in honey-fed rats overall compared with those fed sucrose (p = 0.056) or a sugar free diet (p less than 0.05). Spatial memory was also better in honey fed-rats throughout the 12 month study, these animals not displaying the same degree of age-related spatial memory loss seen in the other two diet groups. No significant differences in recognition memory or learning capability were observed between diet groups after 52 weeks.	In conclusion, both short-term and long-term feeding of honey result in a number of health benefits compared with eating similar amounts of sucrose. These include less weight gain, improved immunity, reduced levels of oxidative damage and improved cognitive performance.. These effects of honey are likely to occur through a number of different processes, although the presence of high concentrations of antioxidants and other minor components in honey are likely to be important contributors. Honey may therefore help to improve human heath if it is used as an alternative to sucrose in foods and beverages, although feeding studies in humans are required to assess its efficacy. In addition, more animal studies are needed to assess which features of honey (e.g. fructose content, antioxidant content and bioactivities) are required to achieve optimal effects, and to determine what impact heating and food processing may have on the beneficial health effects of honey.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">honey</field><field name="subject">sucrose</field><field name="subject">weight gain</field><field name="subject">obesity</field><field name="subject">cogntion</field><field name="subject">calcium uptake</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formal Models and Refinement for Graphical User Interface Design</field><field name="creator">Bowen, Judith Alyson</field><field name="description">Formal approaches to software development require that we correctly describe (or specify) systems in order to prove properties about our proposed solution prior to building it. We must then follow a rigorous process  to transform our specification into an implementation to ensure that the properties we have proved are retained. When we design and build the user interfaces of our systems we are similarly keen to ensure that they have certain properties before we build them. For example, do they satisfy the requirements of the user? Are they designed with known good design principles and usability considerations in mind? User-centred design approaches, which incorporate many different techniques which we may consider as informal, seek to consider these issues so that the UIs we build are designed around the needs and capabilities of real users. Both formal methods and user-centred design are important and beneficial in the development of underlying system functionality and user interfaces respectively. Given this we would like to be able to use both approaches in one integrated software development process. Their differences, however, make this a challenging objective. In this thesis we present a solution this problem by describing models and techniques which provide a bridge between the existing work of user-centred design practitioners and formal methods practitioners enabling us to incorporate (representations of) informal design artefacts into a formal software development process. We then use these models as the basis for a refinement theory for user interfaces which allows interface designers to retain their informal design methods whilst providing an underlying theory grounded in the trace refinement theory of the Microcharts language.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Formal methods</field><field name="subject">UI design</field><field name="subject">user-centred-design</field><field name="subject">refinement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Caring Face of Business?   The Discursive Construction of the New Zealand Businesses for Social Responsibility (NZ BSR) Organisation.</field><field name="creator">Allen, Clifford</field><field name="description">In 2008 the use of the term Business Social Responsibility (BSR) is now seen, in New Zealand at least, as being old fashioned. The field of BSR has been overwhelmed by the terminology of sustainability. In 1998, however, BSR in NZ was a new, exciting, and controversial development. The progression from BSR to sustainability is often presented as natural and inevitable but this thesis argues that BSR and sustainability in New Zealand arose from different roots and most of the key people who became involved in the NZ BSR organisation did so for reasons that were substantially different from the driving rationale of sustainability. Further, not all of those NZ BSR pioneers consider the current focus on sustainability to be a natural outgrowth of what they were trying to achieve through BSR. This thesis applies critical discourse analysis to interview transcripts and archived documents to examine the competing discourses surrounding the formation of the NZ BSR organisation in New Zealand up until the time of its merger to form the Sustainable Business Network. The NZ BSR organisation was seen by some as primarily a reaction to the prevailing hegemony of the ideas of the neo-liberal New Zealand Business Round Table (NZBRT).  The NZ BSR philosophy did not necessarily challenge the neo-liberal inspired reforms of the previous fourteen years but did offer an alternative way for businesses to react to the new environment they found themselves in.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business Social Responsibility</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Business for Social Responsibility</field><field name="subject">Discourse</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a recovery ethos for psychiatric  services in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Smith, Mark Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis is about developing a recovery ethos for psychiatric services in New Zealand. The argument of the thesis is that  currently a procedural ethos is dominant in psychiatric services in New Zealand, based on eclectic ways of facilitating recovery. Recovery from mental illness, is based on the criteria of symptom reduction and functioning and can be further refined to   have a client and professional perspective. Rather than using an eclectic approach to facilitating recovery the thesis argues for a pluralistic approach, where the virtues, the relationship with professionals, client narrative and the psychiatric community become central to decision making, rather than principle based procedures.  The thesis is an argued, applied philosophical thesis in terms of methodology. The scope of the thesis is psychiatric services and the focus is broadly ethical decision making. There are three main divisions to the thesis. Part 1 is concerned with clarification of the main terms used in the thesis. This involves exploring the  historical background to the concept of recovery, clarifying the concept of recovery itself and providing an argument for giving greater prominence to the term mental illness over the term mental disorder. Part 2  identifies the main problem of the thesis, namely the procedural ethos, and the problems it is causing clients suffering from mental illness in facilitating their recovery. Part 3  shows what is involved in developing a recovery ethos for psychiatric services in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Psychiatric services</field><field name="subject">pluralistic approach</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Educational issues in introductory tertiary biology</field><field name="creator">Buntting, Catherine Michelle</field><field name="description">The work presented in this thesis focuses on educational issues in first-year biology courses at university. First-year courses are important because they have the potential to influence student retention and subsequent subject selection choices, as well as learning at higher levels. Further, biology is considered to be an important enabling subject in New Zealand because of the Government's drive towards a biotechnology-based knowledge economy.  Specifically, the work in this thesis explores the educational implications of the increasingly diverse academic backgrounds of students entering first-year biology courses on teaching and learning in these courses. A social constructivist view of learning is adopted, in which prior knowledge of the learners is considered to have a significant influence on their learning. The social context of learning interactions also is considered to be important.  The research involved three phases: identification of prior knowledge assumed by faculty; identification of actual prior knowledge of students; and the implementation and evaluation of an intervention programme based on concept mapping.  In order to investigate faculty assumptions of student prior knowledge, 35 faculty from six New Zealand universities were interviewed. Document analysis and classroom observations provided data triangulation.  The findings for this phase of the research suggest that faculty were aware of the diverse prior knowledge of students, and reported a tension between teaching  from scratch  in order to accommodate those with very limited prior knowledge; and the risk of boring those with more extensive relevant backgrounds.  A range of concepts that are not explained during teaching (i.e., concepts it is assumed students understand) were identified, including biology-specific concepts and relevant chemical and mathematical concepts.  In the second phase, research findings from phase one were used to develop a prior knowledge questionnaire administered in two successive years to all students enrolled in first-year biology courses at one New Zealand university.  Data analysis for this phase suggests that although students with more extensive prior biology study were more likely to have a scientifically acceptable understanding of some key concepts, this was not true of all the concepts that were investigated, including chemical and mathematical concepts. The data also point to differences between what faculty expect students to know, and what students actually know. Furthermore, few students, regardless of the extent of prior biology study, were able to demonstrate understanding of the relationships between important biological concepts.  In the third phase of the research, an intervention based on concept mapping was implemented and evaluated. Two of the six weekly tutorial classes associated with two first-year biology courses were used for the purposes of the intervention. The intervention differed from the other concept mapping studies reported in the literature in that its implementation was of long duration, viz., a period of 11 weeks.  Students who participated in the intervention reported in 'tutorial experience questionnaires' and subsequent interviews that concept mapping helped them to learn the biology content covered during lectures, and to identify links between concepts. A large proportion of participants indicated that they used concept mapping for biology study outside of the intervention tutorial classes, and in some cases in other courses of study.  Classroom management strategies appeared to contribute to the positive views about the use of concept mapping during tutorials. Specifically, the tutor modelled the use of concept mapping, but students were also given opportunities to construct their own maps.  The role of the tutor in guiding discussions with students and providing feedback was also viewed as being important. Detailed analysis of course assessment tasks suggests that concept mapping enhanced learning for test questions that require understanding of links between concepts. Where tasks require only the recall of facts, concept mapping does not appear to make a statistically significant difference to student performance.  The findings from the concept mapping intervention thus suggest that although concept mapping is a strategy that can be used effectively in tertiary biology tutorial classes, it is more worthwhile if the type of deep learning that is encouraged by the use of concept mapping is also the type of learning required to successfully complete assessment tasks. This raises the issue of whether the type of learning faculty specify in course objectives is the type of learning they actually seek to develop in course delivery and associated assessment regimes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">undergraduate</field><field name="subject">tertiary</field><field name="subject">biology education</field><field name="subject">science education</field><field name="subject">concept mapping</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Going 'walli' and having 'jinni': Exploring Somali expressions of psychological distress and approaches to treatment</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Juanita Frances</field><field name="description">Western researchers conducting studies with Somali refugee participants have identified Somali-specific idioms of psychological distress as well as high rates of Western psychological disorders such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in this refugee group.  Methodological limitations of these previous studies, however, have limited the validity of the conclusions drawn.  These limitations include the use of Western psychometric instruments and diagnostic nosologies, limited information about the methodological procedures undertaken, the apparently unqualified use of terms such as  mental illness,  madness  and  craziness  in interview schedules, minimal exploration of psychosomatic idioms of distress, and limited applicability of some of the research findings to Somali women..   The current research primarily aimed to address these methodological short-comings and build on the findings of previous studies that have explored Somali conceptions of distress.  Two additional objectives were to (i) identify protective and resilience factors which may decrease vulnerability to experiencing psychological distress in Somali women, (ii) gauge non-Somali health professionals' understanding of (a) the nature of distress and suffering experienced by Somali women, and (b) effective treatment modalities to ameliorate this distress.   The analytical style employed in all three studies of this thesis was thematic.  In the first study, ten Hamilton (New Zealand) based Somali women were interviewed.  Particular areas of interest explored in the first study included psychological, physical and spiritual conceptions of distress, the symptoms of key idioms of distress, and the way in which these are managed/treated at the individual, community, and family levels. The findings of Study 1 identified spirit (jinn) possession as a form of distress known by at least some members of the local Somali community.  Jinn appeared to be an explanation for both milder forms of distress akin to depression and anxiety, as well as more severe forms of distress similar to psychosis.  Treatment for jinn possession tended to focus on Koran readings in conjunction with family and community-based support.  Generally participants considered there was a very limited role for mental health professionals and Western psychiatric medication in the extraction of jinn. Faith was considered a key protective factor against experiencing non-spiritual forms of distress such as stress, worry, anxiety and depression.  Although war trauma was acknowledged to have an adverse impact on the psychological functioning of Somali women it was not considered to impact on a woman's ability to manage her day-to-day responsibilities.  The impact of having family in refugee camps in Africa was, however, identified as a common and very distressing issue impacting on many Somali women.  The only way of alleviating the distress associated with this stressor, according to participants, was reunification.  Interviewees stated that Western interventions for distress were rarely pursued by Somali as they were not considered efficacious.  Given there is evidence that Somali communities residing in various cities in New Zealand are at various stages of acculturation, it was considered important to ascertain how valid the results from Study 1 were considered to be by women from other Somali communities.  Six focus groups were conducted with a total of 27 Somali women recruited from three New Zealand cities. The findings of Study 2 identified numerous culturally specific forms of distress reported by participants.  These states were qalbijab, boofis, murug, welwel and jinn.  These Somali idioms of distress were akin to some Western psychological disorders, particularly the depression and anxiety spectrums.  Treatment for Somali forms of suffering were reported to focus on Koran readings, in addition to family and community support.  Generally, participants in Study 2 considered there was a very limited role for general practitioners (GPs) and mental health professionals in assisting Somali to deal with psychological and spiritual distress.  Consistent with the findings of Study 1, faith was considered the most important protective factor, family separation was described as one of the most significant stressors, and war related trauma was suggested to cause significant distress only if the sufferer had family still in Africa. Study 3 explored non-Somali health practitioners' understanding of Somali idioms of distress, as well as their perspectives about how to best treat Somali presenting with psychological distress.   A total of 18 mainstream mental health practitioners, general health practitioners (both GPs and primary care nurses), and specialist refugee mental health practitioners took part in this research.  Few practitioners mentioned spirit possession as an aetiology for distress and none mentioned other Somali-specific forms of distress.  The psychosocial stressors identified as contributing to the psychological distress of Somali women were relatively consistent across the three groups of practitioners and also consistent with the stressors identified by participants in Studies 1 and 2 (e.g., family separation, social isolation, financial concerns).  Interviewees did not consider PTSD to be a common psychological disorder amongst Somali women living in New Zealand.  Advocacy work and assistance with day-to-day concerns were suggested by many participants as more efficacious for the amelioration of psychosocial stressors than medication-based treatment.  Generally, participants in Study 3 were supportive of traditional forms of healing being used as the treatment of choice by Somali clients.  The findings of the current thesis suggest that there are clear parallels between Somali idioms of distress and those of Western cultures.  However, the data indicate that equating Somali idioms with Western diagnostic labels would be rejected by Somali.  Regardless of the similarity of symptom profile of some of the Somali states to Western states, the manner in which these states are conceptualised, understood and treated is markedly different.  The findings of all three studies suggested that Somali tend to opt for their own traditional interventions to treat psychological and spiritual forms of distress rather than engage with Western mental health services.  Numerous barriers including long waiting lists, mental health practitioners' apparent lack of knowledge/expertise working cross-culturally and poor treatment outcomes were provided for Somali not engaging with such services.  The stigma attached to having a mental illness was also considered a barrier to engaging with mental health services.  With respect to improving service provision for non-Western clients, an intermediate service that sits between primary and secondary health care agencies is recommended as an effective means of meeting the needs of non-Western clients experiencing psychosocial stressors and mild to moderate psychological distress.  It is imperative, however, that any such service involves key stakeholders from the community groups it would serve, in the design, development, and implementation of interventions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Somali</field><field name="subject">Psychopathology</field><field name="subject">Mental Health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Water Quality Parameters on Prolonged Swimming Ability of Freshwater Fishes</field><field name="creator">Bannon, Henry James</field><field name="description">The critical swimming speed (Ucrit) of rainbow trout parr (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and three life stages of Galaxias maculatus, larval (whitebait), postlarval inanga and adult inanga, were tested at temperatures from 5oC to 25oC.

The potential effect of mild hypoxia (75% saturation) on trout parr and whitebait was also examined at 10oC, 15oC and 20oC, and also tested separately and in combination were the effects of mild hypoxia and severe anaemia on the prolonged swimming ability of trout smolts at temperatures from 10oC to 20oC. For all trout experiments, blood samples were taken from non-exercised and exercised fish by acute caudal venepuncture to determine haematological responses to both acclimation and exercise. Under normoxic conditions, Ucrit max for trout parr (7.0   0.5 cm fork length) was calculated to be 5.8 body lengths per second (BL s-1) at 15.1oC, but declined at lower and higher temperatures. This result implies that swimming performance was limited by temperature below 15oC, whereas performance at higher temperatures was limited by oxygen availability. In support of this hypothesis, mild hypoxia (75% saturation) had no effect at 10oC or 15oC but caused a significant reduction in Ucrit at 20oC. However, fish acclimated at 20oC showed an adaptive elevation in oxygen carrying capacity due to an increase in mean erythrocyte volume and haemoglobin content. Furthermore, acclimation to 20oC improved warm water swimming performance. Trout parr acclimated to 10oC performed significantly worse than fish acclimated to 20oC when swum at 20oC. However, trout parr acclimated to 20oC performed as well as fish acclimated to 10oC when swum at 10oC. Following exercise, haematocrit was elevated under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. However, the primary cause of this apparent increase in oxygen carrying capacity was splenic release of erythrocytes under normoxic conditions, whereas stress-induced erythrocytic swelling contributed to the observed increase in hypoxia. This contrasting response was most pronounced at 10oC. Larval whitebait (4.7 - 5.0 cm total length (TL)) also showed a temperature dependence of prolonged swimming ability with Ucrit max calculated to be 5.1 BL s-1 at 17.7oC. Hypoxia significantly reduced Ucrit at 15oC and 20oC, lowering the optimal aerobic temperature to 13.9oC and reducing Ucrit to 4.2 BL s-1. Mild hypoxia therefore had a more pronounced impact on inanga whitebait than trout. Postlarval inanga (3.9 - 4.0 cm TL) performed poorly at higher temperatures with Ucrit max of 5.6 BL s-1 at 9.4oC indicating an ontogenetic change in swimming ability, possibly resulting from a developmental shift in red muscle kinetics or a greater dependence on anaerobic muscle. Adult inanga (5.5 - 6.8 cm TL) prolonged swimming ability showed similar temperature dependence to that of inanga whitebait but lower relative swimming speeds due to their larger size. The dramatic decline in performance exhibited by juveniles at warmer temperatures was not apparent in adults. Ucrit max for adults was 4.0 BL s-1 at 18.3oC.

To fulfill this, I approached the thesis by examining several research questions and using multiple research methodologies.  The research questions were not all established at the outset.  Rather, they evolved as features of a journey down a road less traveled.  With this journey came the decision to write the thesis in the first person.  The first research question was  Q1:  What will bridge the divide between organizational learning and the learning organization?   By reviewing the extant literature on organizational learning and the learning organization, I developed a theoretical framework that linked these two streams.  The framework suggests that the extent of divide between the two streams is determined by the extent of learning transfer.  The learning transfer is affected by the learning barriers operating at the levels of learning (i.e., individuals, groups, and organizational).  This led me to my second research question Q2:  What are these barriers to learning transfer and how do they impact the levels of learning in the organization?   I cumulated the dispersed literature on learning barriers, and synthesized the learning barriers into five key dimensions: Intrapersonal, relational, cultural, structural, and societal.  I then used the Delphi technique on 17 individuals to investigate the impact of the learning barriers on the levels of learning.  This generated two additional research questions.  The third research question was Q3:  How do individuals initiate a double-loop change?   This deals with the little researched area of initiation of double-loop change whilst engaging with the interfaces at the levels of learning.  I used multiple case studies to examine this question and found that individuals transit through four distinct stages when initiating double-loop change: 'embedded', 'embedded discomfited', 'scripted', and 'unscripted'.  Once double-loop learning has been initiated at the individual level, it is important that it is transferred across the organization.  Therefore, my fourth research question was Q4:  How does a new shared understanding for a double-loop change develop across the organization?   I did an in-depth, single case based investigation of an organization.  Using Identity and Complexity theory perspectives, I tracked the evolving new shared understanding through four phases: de-identification phase, situated re-identification phase, transition phase, and identification with core ideology phase.  The key insights from examining these research questions, particularly insights from examining Q3 and Q4, enabled me to suggest nine key organizational interventions necessary to overcome the learning barriers and develop a learning organization:  Identifying, developing, and dispersing double-loop mastery; Enabling constructive contradictions; Creating a superordinate organizational identity; Building emotional intelligence (in individuals and groups); Ambidextrous leadership; Strategic support for experimentation; Promoting 'systems doing'; Accessibility of valid information; Institutionalizing scanning across industry boundaries.  When these nine organizational interventions are implemented, they produce five new learning organization orientations: genetic diversity, organizational ideology, organizational dualism, organizational coupling, and strategic play.  These five new learning organizational orientations provide the archetypes of the learning organization.  I then developed an instrument to assess these five new orientations, and did a preliminary testing of the instrument.  While aspects of my work overlaid with previous knowledge, new advances in knowledge were established by:   Postulating a link between the streams of organizational learning and learning organization  Synthesizing learning barriers into the five key dimensions, and investigating their impact on the levels of learning  Understanding the stages of double-loop learning initiation by an individual, whilst engaging with the interfaces at the levels of learning  Understanding the process of a new shared understanding evolving  Postulating five new orientations of the learning organization</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learning organization</field><field name="subject">organizational learning</field><field name="subject">learning barriers</field><field name="subject">learning constraints</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adoption and Non-Adoption: Profiling Internet Usage among Tourists to New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rao, Ulhas</field><field name="description">Since the explosion of the internet as a business medium, one of its primary uses has been marketing. The advantages of using the internet for business-to-consumer transactions are clear. The openness of the internet is creating opportunities for virtually all companies across various industries. The words 'internet', 'World Wide Web', 'www' or the 'web' refer to the same thing and are used interchangeably within this research study. The tourism industry is also experiencing a rapid adoption of the internet technology for marketing travel products and services. As a destination New Zealand is a small country comprising two main land masses and smaller outlying islands, with a population of about 4 million people (Statistics New Zealand 2004). Tourism is promoted as an essential part of the national economy, particularly to earn foreign exchange and generate employment. The number of international tourists visiting New Zealand is 2.2 million (Tourism New Zealand, 2006). In New Zealand almost all regional tourism organizations (RTOs) have a web presence, thereby exposing potential tourists to an array of destinations to visit. However, there are few New Zealand based studies that profile tourists based on their internet adoption and the differences between internet users and non-users. The question that baffles every business manager is what predisposes consumers to use a website? This is the fundamental question that motivated the study. While usability does play a major role in the adoption and use of a particular website, it is outside the scope of this project, otherwise the scope would have been too large and complicated to permit a useable questionnaire given the other concerns about respondents' past experiences and attitudes toward use of the net for the specific purposes of holiday purchases. The study draws upon innovation diffusion theory (IDT) and more recent conceptualizations of IT adoption behaviour to examine differences among Rogers' (1995) adoption categories. Within this context, 'adoption' refers to the stage in which a technology is selected for use by an individual. 'Diffusion' refers to the stage in which the technology spreads to general use and application. For this study an attempt is made to create a behavioural profile of visitors based on a sample of 517 overseas visitors to New Zealand. Visitors were asked to complete a questionnaire and provide information on their demographics, travel related behaviour, internet usage patterns, perceptions of the internet and online shopping in general. The thesis thus describes the initiation and evolution of an empirical research project, which investigates the adoption and diffusion of internet technologies amongst international visitors to New Zealand. The study was launched in an attempt to: 1) learn more about internet usage by visitors to New Zealand; 2) create a psychographic profile of visitors; 3) attempt to empirically validate the technology acceptance model (TAM); and 4) fill a noticeable void so that future researchers on IT and internet adoption by tourists in New Zealand have a foundation and starting point. Most of the previous research related to TAM has been in workplace related situations while studies in tourism have used students as subjects, rather than actual visitors to a particular destination (Shang et al., 2005, Moon and Kim, 2001, Klopping and McKinney, 2004). Specific market studies undertaken by destination marketing organisations or regional tourism organisations were considered only inasmuch as they aided generalization as place specificity hindered conceptual development pertaining to themes of adoption and general usage patterns. The study seeks to build on Rogers' (1995) seminal work on the diffusion of innovations and make a unique contribution to existing diffusion studies by its focus on the individual visitors as the unit of analysis and by its test of the TAM model. This study presents descriptive results via standard statistical analysis, a cluster analysis of users and a structural equation modelling of the TAM applied within a context of international visitors to New Zealand. The data were collected at major locations - the viaduct basin in Auckland and the international departure lounge at the Christchurch International Airport. The two locations were chosen to enable faster data collection. Initially the data was gathered at the viaduct basin in Auckland but the number of respondents was not many. Since the data collection was slow, decided to collect from Christchurch International airport where departing passengers could be approached. Individual passengers/tourists were approached and a screening question to ascertain if they were visitors or not was asked. If they were visiting, then they were asked to participate in the survey. No prior specific screening was undertaken to determine if they had used internet or not for their trip/travel to New Zealand. However, subsequent analysis shows that only 2.3% of the sample had not used the internet, and 31% of the sample had not bought tourism products or services over the internet. Therefore, overall, experience and internet usage was not uncommon for the majority of the sample, but a large proportion of non-users existed to permit comparative analysis. While there is a bias towards males in the sample, the 19-35 years age group was slightly more numerous for both genders, than were other age groups. The results indicate that mean internet usage is comparatively high, as is familiarity with many electronic consumer durables. The sample possesses a bias toward English speaking countries, younger people and educationally higher qualified people. Internet search engines seem to be the most popular source of search. The socio-demographic variables such as age, gender and educational attainment appeared to be but a moderate influence on general internet usage and thus on the use of the internet for booking holidays. Factor analysis of the attitudinal statements revealed six factors, which accounted for about 60 % of the total variance. The clear emergence of factors enabled the development of clusters. The clusters appear to have significance with reference to usage rates of internet. The home ownership of electronics shows a high percentage of respondents had mobile phones. This implies that New Zealand Tourism has to look at options or possible services it can introduce to market to these people who could be using mobile devices not only in their country but also while travelling in New Zealand. Wireless is another important development in the field of technology and many of the tourism DMO in other developed countries in Europe and US are adapting approaches based on these technologies to market to potential customers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TAM</field><field name="subject">Online Shopping</field><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2620</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fate and effects of pulp mill effluent solids in the soil environment</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Donald Scott</field><field name="description">The pulp and paper industry in New Zealand annually produces over one hundred thousand dry tonnes of solid waste due to the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents, the majority of which is currently landfilled. The New Zealand Waste Management Strategy (2002) has set a target for  the diversion of commercial organic wastes from landfill to beneficial use to exceed 95% by 2010 . Effluents produced by softwood pulp mills, such as in New Zealand, contain high concentrations of naturally derived resin extractive compounds that are toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms. Improvements in waste water treatment technology has enabled the industry to meet rigorous discharge standards, however, this has resulted in an increase in the production of pulp mill effluent solids which require disposal. This has become an issue for the pulp and paper industry, especially as current landfill space is limited. Land application has been used for many years as a means of disposal of pulp mill wastes. While most studies investigating land application of pulp mill effluent solids have concluded that the risk posed to the environment is low, few have investigated the potential toxicity of these wastes to soil organisms, and these studies did not directly address the effects of resin extractive compounds. Resin extractives have been shown to be recalcitrant and to accumulate in anaerobic sediments. It is not known to what extent resin extractives are bioavailable or degradable in land applied Pulp mill effluent solids (PMES), or their potential to bioaccumulate in soil organisms.  This PhD thesis research sought to extend the knowledge on the environmental fate and effects of pulp mill effluent wastes. It focused on terrestrial systems, which have not been well studied in this respect. Four chemically distinct softwood pulp mill effluent solids, a primary treatment solid and three secondary treatment biosolids, were used to investigate their effects on soil organisms and soil functions. An interdisciplinary approach was adopted, which incorporated three main areas of study, as follows: 1. A comprehensive resin extractives analysis of the pulp mill effluent solids undertaken so that effects on soil organisms and soil functions could be related to the resin extractives chemistry of the individual pulp mill effluent solids tested. 2.  A battery of bioassays used to investigate the toxicity of the selected pulp mill effluent solids. 3.	A field trial set-up to investigate how pulp mill effluent solids affected soil functions and also to investigate the decomposition of pulp mill effluent solids and of resin extractives in these solids. Three hypotheses tested were: I. Pulp mill effluent solids are toxic to soil organisms. II. Resin extractives in pulp mill effluent solids are recalcitrant in the terrestrial environment. III. Pulp mill effluent solids will cause significant measurable negative impacts on soil functional capacity.  A wide range of resin extractives compounds were identified in pulp mill effluent solids, and concentrations of individual compounds varied widely between the different pulp mill effluent solids tested. During the two years after field application of the pulp mill effluent solids, resin extractives declined, however, decay rates of individual compounds were variable. The decay rate of compounds was influenced by the type of pulp mill effluent solids containing these compounds and not by the initial concentration of compounds. All compounds, including resin acids, degraded rapidly in the applied primary solid and in one of the applied biosolids, with average half-lives calculated ranging from three to twelve months. In the other biosolids, resin acids were recalcitrant with average half-lives calculated to be nearly ten years. Laboratory bioassays conducted on oats, earthworms and enchytraeid worms indicated that pulp mill effluent solids had low toxicity to these organisms. An aquatic bioassay organism, however, was acutely affected by aqueous extracts from pulp mill effluent solids. Earthworms were shown to bioaccumulate some resin extractive compounds to a limited extent, indicating that resin extractives were bioavailable in pulp mill effluent solids. Enchytraeid reproduction was reduced by exposure to some pulp mill effluent solids but this was not correlated to resin extractives concentration of the solids tested. Field applied pulp mill effluent solids significantly enhanced the fluxes of CO2 from the soil surface. When mass losses of pulp mill effluent solids carbon were taken into account, it was shown that these solids had little effect on soil respiration. Needle litterbags were placed above and below pulp mill effluent solids and in the litter horizon of a control treatment for 12 months. Needle litter decomposition was not significantly different between treatments, however, changes in enzyme activities were detected in litter beneath pulp mill effluent solids compared to control needle litter that had not been exposed to pulp mill effluent solids. The decomposition rate of field applied pulp mill effluent solids was slow, with half-lives extrapolated to be between five and twenty five years. The decomposition rate appeared to be influenced by the pools of carbon available for decomposition, with primary solids decaying significantly faster than biosolids due to a higher cellulose component.  The conclusions of the PhD thesis research are, therefore, that generally, pulp mill effluent solids used in the study were demonstrated to be relatively benign and appear to pose a low risk to the terrestrial ecosystem when applied to soil. However, a cautious approach is still recommended to land application, based on the extensive evidence of disruption to aquatic ecosystems, and because pulp mill effluent solids will take many years to decompose and resin acids are recalcitrant in some pulp mill effluent solids. Further research is recommended to elucidate mechanisms of action by resin extractives in soil organisms and the ultimate fate of these compounds in the soil compartment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pulp mill effluent</field><field name="subject">resin acid</field><field name="subject">biosolid</field><field name="subject">soil application</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analysis of Precision teaching</field><field name="creator">Pocock, Trudy Louise</field><field name="description">This research examined three components of precision teaching; charting, timed practices, and performance aims. In the first study beginner skaters performed two roller skating skills, forward crosses and back scissors, with the aim of increasing fluency in these skills using precision teaching methods.  Skaters were told to perform the skills as fast as they could during 1-min practises, aiming at a set performance aim, or goal. After each timing skaters were told how many repetitions they had performed. One group charted back scissors only and the other forward crosses only. The skaters became faster in both skills and charting did not produce faster rates. The improvement seen may have been a direct result of the performance aims. Therefore the second study, using back crosses, compared a fixed, difficult performance aim (complete 50 per minute) for one group and an easier, flexible performance aim (beat your previous sessions' high score) for a second group. After each timing skaters were told how many back crosses they had performed. Performance rates increased similarly for both groups, thus the different performance aims did not have different effects, contrary to the goal-setting literature. A third study investigated this further. Skaters performed forward crosses and back scissors during a baseline condition, where there were no performance aims or feedback. Increases in performance rates for both skills occurred. In a second condition, a performance aim higher than their number of repetitions in the previous condition was set and feedback was given for one skill only. There was an immediate increase in rate of the targeted skill for 3 of the 4 skaters, suggesting that the goal, when given with feedback, influenced the rate at which the skaters performed the skill. In the fourth study, where the effect of feedback and practice was examined more closely, soccer players dribbled a ball in and out of cones. As expected those who took part in eight to ten sessions that were told to do their best (an easy goal) and not given feedback performed this skill faster than those who completed only two sessions with the same conditions. Unexpectedly, they also performed faster than those set a performance aim of beating their previous highest score (a hard goal) and who were given feedback. Methodological issues that may have been responsible for this latter result were addressed in the fifth study. Skaters completing 10 sessions of forward crosses, with feedback and with a performance aim of completing 60 repetitions in one minute (a hard goal), became faster than skaters completing 10 sessions without feedback who were told to do their best. Skaters told to do their best, who completed only three sessions without feedback, did not get faster. These results support those in the goal-setting literature that, hard goals with feedback have more effect than being told to do your best. Overall these studies show that short, timed practices and hard performance aims, or goals, may be effective components of precision teaching while visual feedback from charting may not. Further, precision teaching methods were effective when applied to sporting skills such as those used by roller skaters and soccer players for building fluency of basic skills.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">precision teaching</field><field name="subject">rate</field><field name="subject">goals</field><field name="subject">feedback</field><field name="subject">fluency</field><field name="subject">roller skating</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2622</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Correlations between MO Eigenvectors and the Thermochemistry of Simple Organic Molecules, Related to Empirical Bond Additivity Schemes</field><field name="creator">Lee, Matthew Colin John</field><field name="description">A bondingness term is further developed to aid in heat of formation (&#916;fH&#186;) calculations for C, N, O and S containing molecules. Bondingness originated from qualitative investigations into the antibonding effect in the occupied MOs of ethane. Previous work used a single parameter for bondingness to calculate &#916;fH&#186; in an alkane homologous series using an additivity scheme. This work modifies the bondingness algorithm and uses the term to parameterise a test group of 345 molecules consisting of 17 subgroups that include alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amines, amides, diazenes, nitriles, nitroalkanes, nitrates, thiols and benzenoids. Comparing experimental with calculated &#916;fH&#186; values, a standard deviation for the residuals of 6.3 kJ mol 1 can be achieved using bondingness with a simple steric repulsion term (SSR) in a bond additivity scheme, and a standard deviation of 5.2 kJ mol 1 can be achieved using a Lennard-Jones potential. The method is compared with the group method of Pedley, which for a slightly smaller set of 338 molecules, a subset of the test set of 345 molecules, gives a standard deviation of 7.0 kJ mol 1.  Bondingness, along with SSR or a Lennard-Jones potential, is parameterised in the lowest level of ab initio (HF-SCF) or semiempirical quantum chemical calculations. It therefore may be useful in determining the &#916;fH&#186; values for the largest molecules that are amenable to quantum chemical calculation.  As part of our analysis we calculated the difference between the lowest energy conformer and the average energy of a mixture populated with higher energy conformers. This is the difference between the experimental &#916;fH&#186; value and the &#916;fH&#186; calculated for a single conformer. Example calculations which we have followed are given by Dale and Eliel et al.. Dale calculates the energy difference for molecules as large as hexane using relative energies based on the number of 1,4 gauche interactions. We have updated these values with constant increments ascertained by Klauda et al. as well as ab initio MP2 cc-pVDZ relative energies and have included calculations for heptane and octane.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MOs</field><field name="subject">Enthalpy of Formation</field><field name="subject">Total Energy</field><field name="subject">Bond Additivity</field><field name="subject">Thermochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beginning Teacher Learning and Professional Development: An Analysis of Induction Programmes</field><field name="creator">Langdon, Frances June</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the first two years of beginning teachers' professional development and learning. The study sought to document and understand the conditions and discursive practices of seven purposely selected schools that were implementing robust beginning teacher induction programmes. The focus was on induction, located in a comprehensive national system, to reveal the practices and tensions experienced by beginning teachers as they advanced their learning and development. It is anticipated that the seven case studies, along with the working theory of sound induction will add to the body of knowledge in the field of teacher learning and professional development and contribute to the debate about teachers' work and quality teaching. Few studies have investigated beginning teacher (BT) induction in comprehensively resourced systems. Much of the research investigates fragmented parts of BT experiences. The literature shows that when a holistic examination of induction is carried out it tends to be predominantly in the secondary school context. In-depth research into year one and year two teacher learning and professional development in sound primary school induction programmes was not found. The study provides a working theory of beginning teacher learning and, as Renwick (2001, p. 33) suggested,  exemplars to maximise the effectiveness of schools to employ and support beginning teachers . Sound induction has the potential to positively influence teacher practice as research evidence indicates early career experiences affect future practice. The research is a multi-site collective case study that takes an interpretative, qualitative stance drawing on constructionism to inform the interplay between sociological and psychological theoretical disciplines, which make the information visible in different ways. The case studies scrutinise in depth, individual school contexts and are instrumental in providing better understanding and theorising about the collective case of beginning teacher induction. The primary sources of data were individual and focus group interview transcriptions. In addition, there were the accompanying notes and related school documentation. i Data analysis was an iterative process of inductive and deductive reasoning to make meaning that moved beyond description to identify categories and themes that emerged both within schools and across schools. Evidence of sound BT induction was found although variation in induction practices between schools was noted. Beginning teacher induction went beyond advice and guidance to incorporate educative mentoring in collaborative, collegial schools where high expectations prevailed. The findings suggest that teacher learning should be informed but not constrained by lock-step models of learning and development. Aspects of development as a professional were advanced and, in other respects, marginalised by the education policy focus on children's achievement. Feedback and children's learning and achievement underpin beginning teachers' judgements about their development as teachers. The socio-economic school contexts were less important than the quality of leadership, school cultures, expectations and the confidence of individual novice teachers. The study raises questions about the nature of teachers' work and teacher, government and societal expectations. It is anticipated that these findings will increase understanding of, and provoke debate about beginning teacher learning and their development as professionals.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">teacher learning</field><field name="subject">induction programmes</field><field name="subject">induction programs</field><field name="subject">professional development of teachers</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">school culture</field><field name="subject">mentors</field><field name="subject">mentoring</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Use of Solubility Parameters to Select Membrane Materials for Pervaporation of Organic Mixtures</field><field name="creator">Buckley-Smith, Marion</field><field name="description">Pevaporation is a method for separating volatile components from liquid mixtures at ambient temperatures. The paint processing industry uses Hansen solubility parameters (HSP) to indicate polymer solubility. The potential of this method to predict solvent-polymer affinity was investigated for screening potential membrane materials for the pervaporation of a model solution containing linalool and linalyl acetate (major components of lavender essential oil), in ethanol. Published HSP values were collated for various polymers, and statistically analysed to determine variations in HSP values for polymer species. An investigation of published research into pervaporation of organic/organic binary solutions separated by homogeneous membranes indicated that the solvent whose HSP value was closest to that of the polymer would preferentially permeate. This relationship did not always hold for halogenated solvents or aqueous/organic solutions. Conflicting literature regarding the relationship between solvent uptake by polymers and HSP relative energy differences was resolved using a logarithmic relationship between these two parameters. The following membranes were selected, using their HSP to indicate their potential to interact with lavender oil components: Polyamide (PA: 26.9 micro;m), Polycarbonate (PC: 20.5 micro;m), Poly(ether imide) (PEI: 29.2 micro;m), Poly(ether sulphone) (PES: 27.6 micro;m), Polyethylene (HDPE: 10 micro;m, LDPE: 13-30 micro;m), Polyimide (PI: 30.0 micro;m), Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA: 50 micro;m), Polypropylene (PP: 15.9 micro;m), and Poly(tetrafluoro ethylene) (PTFE: 26.7 micro;m). The HSP (dispersive, polar  hydrogen bonding components) for each membrane were calculated using the mean value obtained from swelling experiments, group contribution (calculated using Hoftyzer-Van Krevelen, Hoy and Beerbower methods), refractive indices (dispersive component), dielectric constants (polar component), and published HSP values. Pervaporation experiments investigated the effect of membrane thickness, process temperature, permeate pressure, impinging jet heights, feed flow rates and concentrations, and pre-soaking the membrane; on flow rate and selectivity in a polyethylene membrane. Membrane thickness was the dominant factor in membrane selectivity; the thinnest membranes (11.3-14.8 micro;m) had much poorer selectivity than membranes gt;24.7 micro;m. Temperatures between 22-34ordm;C, permeate pressure lt;10 kPa, impinging jet heights between 0.36-3.36 mm, feed flow rates between 541-1328 mL/min and concentrations between 1.78-6.01 % v/v of linalool and linalyl acetate in ethanol did not significantly affect selectivity. Flow rates increased with operating temperature, permeate pressure, and impinging jet heights. However, feed flow rate and concentration had no effect on membrane flux rate. Pre-soaking the membrane reduced the time to reach steady-state. Selected membranes were further investigated under standard operating conditions (permeate temperature 30ordm;C, permeate pressure lt;10 kPa, impinging jet height 1.36 mm, feed flow rate 804 mL/min and feed concentration of 5% v/v of linalool and linalyl acetate in ethanol). PMMA completely disintegrated in feed solution, and PC was too brittle to make an effective homogeneous membrane. PA, PC, PEI and PTFE had the highest efficiency (selectivity x flow rate) in their homogeneous form. However, PEI, PI and PTFE had the greatest selectivity, thus further trials should be done to improve stability and flow rates through these membranes. Pervaporation selectivity did not always follow trends predicted by HSP. Although polymers such as PA, PEI, PES, and PI preferentially permeated linalool as predicted, PC, PP and PTFE did not preferentially permeate linalyl acetate. This may have been due to the difference in size and diffusivity of these molecules (linalyl acetate, the larger molecule, did not follow the sorption selectivity predictions), or reliability of literature HSP values and those calculated by group contribution. This research shows that HSP is a good screening method for pervaporation membranes, especially where the molecules being separated are of comparable size. Polymers that have HSP close to the desired component and not to other components tend to have the best selectivity and flux characteristics. However, diffusion is an important factor, and is not completely accounted for by HSP. Recommendations for further research include: carrying out pervaporation analyses of selected polymers using pure lavender essential oil; modifying polymers to form asymmetric or composite membranes with improved permeation characteristics; and potential use of thin channel inverse gas chromatography to determine a more accurate HSP which includes diffusivity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pervaporation</field><field name="subject">essential oil processing</field><field name="subject">volatile organic liquid mixtures</field><field name="subject">organic-organic</field><field name="subject">organic/organic</field><field name="subject">membrane process</field><field name="subject">polymer membrane</field><field name="subject">Hansen solubility parameters</field><field name="subject">membrane selection procedure</field><field name="subject">permeation</field><field name="subject">evaporation</field><field name="subject">polymer solute solvent affinity</field><field name="subject">linalool</field><field name="subject">linalyl acetate</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interruption events and sensemaking processes: A narrative analysis of older people's relationships with computers</field><field name="creator">Richardson, Margaret Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a situated understanding of the ways in which the reality of a new technology is socially constructed. In particular, it examines how members of the aged interpretive community made sense of the computer as an interruption event, a technology not yet routinised as part of their everyday taken-for-granted reality, and needing to be consciously considered and evaluated to make it understandable. Members' sensemaking is studied as a narrative process in which meaning is produced by drawing on a repertoire of narratives, evaluating and developing localised responses to those narratives for the purpose of action taking. Two hundred and four participants over the age of 55 years, recruited predominantly from senior citizens' and SeniorNet organisations in the North Island of New Zealand, were interviewed in 28 focus groups over an eighteen month period between September 2001 and May 2003. Participants were categorised according to their self-identified membership of one of three groups:  computer users affiliated to SeniorNet member organisations; computer users without SeniorNet organisational affiliation; and non-computer-users. Their computer-related stories were analysed using narrative analysis to identify and map the similar and different ways in which they constructed computers and themselves in relation to computers, in the stories they told.  The research findings from this interpretive study augment the largely functionalist literature on older people and computers and provide insights not identified in previous studies. In particular, the findings indicate that participants identified a common meaning for the computer as actually or potentially useful for older people, but their meanings also varied according to their membership of one of the three participant groups, with SeniorNet members tending to identify the computer as an opportunity; Users, as a tool; and Nonusers, as a threat. Participants' meanings were traced through a storying process that identified three narrative elements as key: the settings in which accounts of the principal protagonists older people and computers were produced; the strength of the narrator's identification with old stories and values; and the ways in which the narrators oriented to the computer in the context of other technologies and events, or in isolation from them. The study makes a contribution to knowledge by enhancing understanding of older people's relationships with computers, through a micro level investigation of their experiences with, and meanings for, the technology. In addition, by identifying and explicating the processes through which the ongoing reality of a new technology is constructed and negotiated, and compared and contrasted in relation to three separate sub-groups of the one demographic population, the study contributes to social construction of technology theory. The study also makes a contribution to practice by showing how the alignment of old stories and new stories is a crucial component in the process for enabling those new to a technology to negotiate an appropriate placement for it, and how such alignment can be influenced by age-peer groups and the imperatives of inter-generational family communication.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interruption events</field><field name="subject">sensemaking</field><field name="subject">narrative analysis</field><field name="subject">computers</field><field name="subject">aged persons</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of Fibre Processing and Treatments on Hemp Fibre/Epoxy and Hemp Fibre/PLA Composites</field><field name="creator">Islam, Mohammad Saiful</field><field name="description">In recent years, due to growing environmental awareness, considerable attention has been given to the development and production of natural fibre reinforced polymer (both thermoset and thermoplastic) composites. The main objective of this study was to reinforce epoxy and polylactic acid (PLA) with hemp fibre to produce improved composites by optimising the fibre treatment methods, composite processing methods, and fibre/matrix interfacial bonding. An investigation was conducted to obtain a suitable fibre alkali treatment method to: (i) remove non-cellulosic fibre components such as lignin (sensitive to ultra violet (UV) radiation) and hemicelluloses (sensitive to moisture) to improve long term composites stability (ii) roughen fibre surface to obtain mechanical interlocking with matrices (iii)expose cellulose hydroxyl groups to obtain hydrogen and covalent bonding with matrices (iv) separate the fibres from their fibre bundles to make the fibre surface available for bonding with matrices (v) retain tensile strength by keeping fibre damage to a minimum level and (vi) increase crystalline cellulose by better packing of cellulose chains to enhance the thermal stability of the fibres. An empirical model was developed for fibre tensile strength (TS) obtained with different treatment conditions (different sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium sulphite (Na2SO3) concentrations, treatment temperatures, and digestion times) by a partial factorial design. Upon analysis of the alkali fibre treatments by single fibre tensile testing (SFTT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), zeta potential measurements, differential thermal analysis/thermogravimetric analysis (DTA/TGA), wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD), lignin analysis and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, a treatment consisting of 5 wt% NaOH and 2 wt% Na2SO3 concentrations, with a treatment temperature of 120oC and a digestion time of 60 minutes, was found to give the best combination of the required properties. This alkali treatment produced fibres with an average TS and Young's modulus (YM) of 463 MPa and 33 GPa respectively. The fibres obtained with the optimised alkali treatment were further treated with acetic anhydride and phenyltrimethoxy silane. However, acetylated and silane treated fibres were not found to give overall performance improvement. Cure kinetics of the neat epoxy (NE) and 40 wt% untreated fibre/epoxy (UTFE) composites were studied and it was found that the addition of fibres into epoxy resin increased the reaction rate and decreased the curing time. An increase in the nucleophilic activity of the amine groups in the presence of fibres is believed to have increased the reaction rate of the fibre/epoxy resin system and hence reduced the activation energies compared to NE. The highest interfacial shear strength (IFSS) value for alkali treated fibre/epoxy (ATFE) samples was 5.2 MPa which was larger than the highest value of 2.7 MPa for UTFE samples supporting that there was a stronger interface between alkali treated fibre and epoxy resin. The best fibre/epoxy bonding was found for an epoxy to curing agent ratio of 1:1 (E1C1) followed by epoxy to curing agent ratios of 1:1.2 (E1C1.2), 1: 0.8 (E1C0.8), and finally for 1:0.6 (E1C0.6). Long and short fibre reinforced epoxy composites were produced with various processing conditions using vacuum bag and compression moulding. A 65 wt% untreated long fibre/epoxy (UTLFE) composite produced by compression moulding at 70oC with a TS of 165 MPa, YM of 17 GPa, flexural strength of 180 MPa, flexural modulus of 10.1 GPa, impact energy (IE) of 14.5 kJ/m2, and fracture toughness (KIc) of 5 MPa.m1/2 was found to be the best in contrast to the trend of increased IFSS for ATFE samples. This is considered to be due to stress concentration as a result of increased fibre/fibre contact with the increased fibre content in the ATFE composites compared to the UTFE composites. Hygrothermal ageing of 65 wt% untreated and alkali treated long and short fibre/epoxy composites (produced by curing at 70oC) showed that long fibre/epoxy composites were more resistant than short fibre/epoxy composites and ATFE composites were more resistant than UTFE composites towards hygrothermal ageing environments as revealed from diffusion coefficients and tensile, flexural, impact, fracture toughness, SEM, TGA, and WAXRD test results. Accelerated ageing of 65 wt% UTLFE and alkali treated long fibre/epoxy (ATLFE) composites (produced by curing at 70oC) showed that ATLFE composites were more resistant than UTLFE composites towards hygrothermal ageing environments as revealed from tensile, flexural, impact, KIc, SEM, TGA, WAXRD, FTIR test results. IFSS obtained with untreated fibre/PLA (UFPLA) and alkali treated fibre/PLA (ATPLA) samples showed that ATPLA samples had greater IFSS than that of UFPLA samples. The increase in the formation of hydrogen bonding and mechanical interlocking of the alkali treated fibres with PLA could be responsible for the increased IFSS for ATPLA system compared to UFPLA system. Long and short fibre reinforced PLA composites were also produced with various processing conditions using compression moulding. A 32 wt% alkali treated long fibre PLA composite produced by film stacking with a TS of 83 MPa, YM of 11 GPa, flexural strength of 143 MPa, flexural modulus of 6.5 GPa, IE of 9 kJ/m2, and KIc of 3 MPa.m1/2 was found to be the best. This could be due to the better bonding of the alkali treated fibres with PLA. The mechanical properties of this composite have been found to be the best compared to the available literature. Hygrothermal and accelerated ageing of 32 wt% untreated and alkali treated long fibre/PLA composites ATPLA composites were more resistant than UFPLA composites towards hygrothermal and accelerated ageing environments as revealed from diffusion coefficients and tensile, flexural, impact, KIc, SEM, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), WAXRD, and FTIR results. Increased potential hydrogen bond formation and mechanical interlocking of the alkali treated fibres with PLA could be responsible for the increased resistance of the ATPLA composites. Based on the present study, it can be said that the performance of natural fibre composites largely depend on fibre properties (e.g. length and orientation), matrix properties (e.g. cure kinetics and crystallinity), fibre treatment and processing methods, and composite processing methods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hemp Fibre</field><field name="subject">Epoxy Resin</field><field name="subject">Poly(lactic acid)</field><field name="subject">Interfacial Shear Strength</field><field name="subject">Fracture Toughness</field><field name="subject">Impact Energy</field><field name="subject">Tensile Properties</field><field name="subject">Flexural Properties</field><field name="subject">Accelerated Ageing</field><field name="subject">Hygrothermal Ageing</field><field name="subject">Experimental Design</field><field name="subject">Cure Kinetics</field><field name="subject">Dynamic Sheet Forming</field><field name="subject">Long and Short Fibres</field><field name="subject">Untreated Fibre</field><field name="subject">Alkali Treated Fibre</field><field name="subject">Silane Treated Fibre</field><field name="subject">Acetylated Fibre</field><field name="subject">Zeta Potential</field><field name="subject">Differential Scanning Calorimetry</field><field name="subject">X-ray Diffraction</field><field name="subject">Infrared Spectra.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organising and Sustaining Hegemony: A Gramscian Perspective on Suharto's New Order Indonesia.</field><field name="creator">Casci, Ross Ormond</field><field name="description">The Suharto New Order was born out of ethnic conflict around religious, ideological and regional/cultural issues that were threatening national chaos.  As a pre-requisite to pursuing the socio-political and economic developmental agendas deemed necessary to legitimize their hold on power, the new regime committed the resources of the state behind forging national unity and stability out of potentially antagonistic ethnic and cultural diversity.  This study examines how the Suharto New Order sustained the processes that organised the Indonesian nation behind its agendas through an exclusive representation of the state ideology Pancasila, as the ideological pillar of socio-political and economic development.                        The Italian Marxist, Antonio Gramsci, viewed social politics as an arrangement that inextricably linked pluralism, political participation and ideological supremacy and placed critical emphasis on the methods by which a ruling order deployed ideology and culture to craft mass consensus that would underwrite the moral and intellectual legitimacy of hegemonic rule.  The study is original in that it contrasts Gramsci's insights into ideology as a discourse of hegemonic legitimacy, in the context of the Suharto New Order's exclusive representation of Pancasila as the ideological pillar of the regime's arrangement of Indonesian life.  The study also examines whether the Gramscian model of hegemonic order is robust when employed to explain the Suharto regime's decline and collapse, as well as the prospects for socio-political and economic stability during the post-Suharto transitionary phase and the pressures of Islamic socio-political resurgence, which were accompanied by demands for more liberal democratic processes and participation.                          Antonio Gramsci provides the analytical framework for the study, and the Suharto New Order the behavioural perspective, with the prime purpose of the research being to test Gramsci's model of hegemonic order and ideological legitimacy against a contemporary context.  With Indonesia comprising the world's largest Islamic population, the Suharto New Order's endeavours to construct national consensus and unity around Pancasila's secular-nationalist orientation suggest prima facie a highly appropriate perspective in which to test Gramsci's theories.  The post-Suharto era of transition, also offers a timely opportunity to test the Italian Marxist's thoughts on crafting national consensus to underwrite a ruling arrangement's ideological legitimacy in the contemporary environment of Islamic socio-political resurgence accompanied by a global spread of secular, liberal democratic ideals.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Suharto and Gramsci</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Communicating strategically: public relations and organisational legitimacy</field><field name="creator">Schoenberger-Orgad, Mich&#232;le Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to facilitate an understanding of some of the critical debates in public relations theory and practice. It joins others in contributing to a shift from a functional systems-based public relations paradigm to one where public relations is transparently seen as playing a role in shaping democracy in a global society. The research analyses NATO's communication operations in the Kosovo Campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, examining the case from a number of different perspectives. The thesis contributes to the body of knowledge of public relations practices and how, in this case, they were used to inform and persuade publics of the moral cause of a bombing mission to achieve specific strategic organisational and communication goals. Further, it contextualises the case of NATO as an organisation facing a crisis in legitimacy following the end of the Cold War. It demonstrates how the Kosovo Campaign provided a vehicle to transform NATO's identity while retaining military capabilities, to make the organisation relevant to the global demands of the 21st century. In this way, NATO could claim a  unique self  and maintain its credibility and relevance. The thesis argues that NATO's public relations campaign was successful in maintaining both credibility and popular support for a 78-day bombing campaign within the 19 nations of the Alliance. The campaign allowed NATO to claim that it was the only organisation that could provide ii security and stability, as well as be the main bulwark of the defence of Western values in a rapidly globalising and changing world. Moreover, by framing the Kosovo air campaign as a humanitarian intervention, NATO was not only able to legitimise its actions but transform its military might with an acceptable human face in order to achieve its broader ideological goals in Europe. This thesis demonstrates how military interventions on behalf of powerful interests can be legitimised if the appropriate public relations framework is used and acceptable communication strategies employed. It suggests how citizens of democratic countries can be led to support decision-makers who present themselves as acting altruistically even when their actions may be self-interested.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public relations</field><field name="subject">Kosovo</field><field name="subject">NATO</field><field name="subject">legitimacy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Price of Mauri: Exploring the validity of Welfare Economics when seeking to measure M&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori</field><field name="creator">Awatere, Shaun</field><field name="description">Since the 1980s New Zealand has pursued neo-classical or market-based policies with a particular fervour. Market-based options are seen by resource management decision makers as essential frameworks for efficiently allocating resources, an approach that continues to support the view of the inherent dominance of Western knowledge. This is particularly concerning, given that M&#257;ori (the indigenous people of New Zealand), have an important role to play in New Zealand resource management and perceive their own knowledge systems have been marginalised. The primary goal of this thesis is to explore the validity of welfare economics when seeking to measure quantitatively M&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori or M&#257;ori views of the environment through the contingent valuation method. A contingent valuation study is carried out using three separate samples drawn from the general M&#257;ori population in Auckland city, a h&#257;pu/sub-tribe indigenous to the Auckland isthmus, and drivers of motor vehicles in Auckland city. Data collection modes include a postal survey and face-to-face interviews. This thesis challenges the validity of political-legal ethnicity constructs to measure M&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori. The search for a central tendency will lead to biased, misleading and inaccurate results. The thesis also challenges the validity of contingent valuation to produce true economic measures and to measure and identify M&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori. Despite advances in analytical techniques, economic efficiency measures are always deficient, given the difficulty of capturing and anticipating all impacts and valuing them appropriately. M&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori is derived from a M&#257;ori epistemology and should be considered or analysed with primary reference to this body of knowledge. Economic analysis is only one important cog in the machinery of resource management policy. Given that an economist's contribution to local and regional resource management is most valuable when focusing on the  economic efficiency  of the proposed resource allocation, it is appropriate that other perspectives such as M&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori be considered.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">welfare economics</field><field name="subject">non-market valuation</field><field name="subject">contingent valuation</field><field name="subject">m&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploration of Senior High School Student Learning in Biology in Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Lu, Tan-Ni</field><field name="description">This thesis explores senior high school student learning in biology in Taiwan. The Confucian-heritage culture and beliefs associated with high stakes examinations influences the learning context in biology. There is a considerable body of international research on teaching and learning in senior high biology. There appears to be limited research on student and teacher views of learning in biology in this context. A social constructivist view of learning underpins this study. Using an interpretive paradigm, this study explores student and teacher perceptions of student learning experiences in senior high school biology. There are three phases in this study. In the first phase, Grade 11 and Grade 12 students and teacher perceptions of the existing teaching and learning situation in biology was explored. In the second phase, an intervention was designed and implemented for Grade 12 students. In the third phase, the intervention was evaluated.  The findings of this study indicate that most students take biology to increase their options for entering tertiary education. Noticeably, they were using learning approaches that they most disliked to increase their biology marks. Most of them considered the current biology classes were very effective in coping with the major examination, but the teaching was monotonous and teaching content as seemingly unrelated to real life. The teachers perceived that student learning was passive, which contributed to the teachers feeling of exhaustion. Qualitative and quantitative data indicated that both the students and teachers were dissatisfied with the current teaching and learning situation. A more interactive teaching and learning approach and more student responsibility in investigations were suggested by the respondents.  An intervention programme based on a social constructivist view of learning, including interactive teaching and open investigation, was designed and implemented. The intervention (70% lecture classes and 30% experiment classes) problematised the traditional lesson structure (90% lecture classes and 10% experiment classes) of senior biology in Taiwan, seeking a more cohesive and integrated overall structure for learning biology. Evaluation of the intervention programme suggested that through student-teacher and student-student interactions student conceptual and procedural understanding of biology was facilitated and their attitudes towards learning were enhanced. A few of the students could not accept the intervention as it conflicted with their view of learning in an examination culture. The implications of this research are that more teacher-student and peer interactions and open-ended investigations can lead to enhanced learning in biology in Taiwan for most senior high school students. Social constructivist approaches to teaching and learning are viable in a Taiwanese biology classroom context. The study also showed the potential for open investigations in this context.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">a social constructivist view of learning</field><field name="subject">approaches to learning biology</field><field name="subject">interactive teaching</field><field name="subject">open investigation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the performance of Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models on Information Extraction tasks</field><field name="creator">Chou, Lin-Yi</field><field name="description">This thesis presents novel methods for creating and improving hierarchical hidden Markov models.  The work centers around transforming a traditional tree structured hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM) into an equivalent model that reuses repeated sub-trees.  This process temporarily breaks the tree structure constraint in order to leverage the benefits of combining repeated sub-trees. These benefits include lowered cost of testing and an increased accuracy of the final model-thus providing the model with greater performance.  The result is called a merged and simplified hierarchical hidden Markov model (MSHHMM).  The thesis goes on to detail four techniques for improving the performance of MSHHMMs when applied to information extraction tasks, in terms of accuracy and computational cost.  Briefly, these techniques are: a new formula for calculating the approximate probability of previously unseen events; pattern generalisation to transform observations, thus increasing testing speed and prediction accuracy; restructuring states to focus on state transitions; and an automated flattening technique for reducing the complexity of HHMMs.  The basic model and four improvements are evaluated by applying them to the well-known information extraction tasks of Reference Tagging and Text Chunking.  In both tasks, MSHHMMs show consistently good performance across varying sizes of training data. In the case of Reference Tagging, the accuracy of the MSHHMM is comparable to other methods. However, when the volume of training data is limited, MSHHMMs maintain high accuracy whereas other methods show a significant decrease.  These accuracy gains were achieved without any significant increase in processing time.  For the Text Chunking task the accuracy of the MSHHMM was again comparable to other methods. However, the other methods incurred much higher processing delays compared to the MSHHMM.  The results of these practical experiments demonstrate the benefits of the new method-increased accuracy, lower computation costs, and better performance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hidden Markov model</field><field name="subject">hierarchical hidden Markov model</field><field name="subject">information extraction</field><field name="subject">text mining</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of climate and land use change on invasive species: A case study of Tradescantia fluminensis (Vell.) in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Storey, Liza Preethy</field><field name="description">Climate change, land use change and invasive species are transforming global biodiversity at multiple scales. Projections are for threats to biodiversity from these global changes to continue into the future, with varied and discernible distribution changes for many species. Concomitantly, these global changes will interact with each other to further exacerbate the problem, as exemplified in this study. In New Zealand, climate change is expected to affect landscapes, fragmented and disturbed by land use change, further increasing the potential invasibility of these landscapes for a suite of existing and emerging invasive species. This thesis is concerned with the combined effects of climate and land use changes on the spatial distribution of the sub-tropical invasive plant, Tradescantia fluminensis (Vell.). The contribution of this thesis is to undertake an integrated assessment of the distribution change for this species in New Zealand. On the basis that climatic variables affect species distribution at larger scales, while land use, habitat, disturbance and dispersal mechanisms affect distribution at smaller scales, two separate analyses were undertaken. At the national scale BioCLIM and the Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) were implemented using the variables: minimum temperature (July-August), MTminJ-A, and annual water deficit (November-February). At the landscape scale, only ENFA was implemented, using the variables: MTminJ-A, ECOSAT riparian classes (habitat) and proximity to roads, urban areas and streams (disturbance and dispersal sources). Three scenarios of climate change (CCSR B1-Low, CSIRO9 A1B-Mid and HadCM A1FI-High) and two scenarios of land use change (SmartGrowth and Buildout) were developed to the year 2050, using the CLIMPACTS Open Framework Modelling System and Geographic Information Systems, GIS, techniques respectively. The baseline species distribution model was extrapolated in ENFA, using the 2050 scenarios. Changes to potential threat from this species to protected areas at the landscape level were assessed spatially at the landscape level. This approach and its results are novel for this species.  At the national scale the results for the modelling show that climate change will increase the potential habitat suitability of Tradescantia under all combined scenarios of CCSR, CSIRO9 and HadCM for mean minimum temperature (July-August), MTminJ-A and Annual Water Deficit, AWD. At the case study landscape, in the Western Bay of Plenty and Tauranga also the modelling results showed that climate change and land use changes will increase the suitability for Tradescantia by 2050. The 'core' or highest suitability areas increase under all future scenarios. At the national level core suitability increased by about 13% for the CCSR:B1-Low and CSIRO9:A1B-Mid and 22% for HadCM:A1FI-High combined scenario on the North Island. On the South Island, core areas increased by a much lower margin - 1.4%, 2.3% and 2.9% for CCSR:B1-Low, CSIRO9:A1B-Mid and HadCM:A1FI-High combined scenarios respectively. At the landscape level core areas increased by 5%, 8% and 21% for the CCSR:B1-Low+SmartGrowth, Darlam:A1b-Mid+SmartGrwoth and HadCM:A1FI-High+Build-out combined scenarios, respectively. This is true also for the Protected areas within the case study landscape, and indicate that the increasing if Tradescantia is able to track both climate and land use change through its dispersal and migration within the landscape 9 primarily in the inland and upland direction), then is will pose a greater risk to native habitats than at present.  Integrated assessments and the outputs they produce are essential to exploring anticipated changes (through scenario-building) and in understanding the change spatial context and magnitude of projected changes from the combined effects of climate and land use changes into the future and need to be integrated into biodiversity-biosecurity management at multiple scales.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tradescantia fluminensis</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">land use change</field><field name="subject">Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA)</field><field name="subject">BioCLIM</field><field name="subject">scenarios</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2634</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Operant Methodology Out Of The Lab and Applied To Enrichment With Captive Chimpanzees (Pan Troglodytes)</field><field name="creator">Vivian, Melanie</field><field name="description">A group of socially-housed chimpanzees, maintained in a zoo facility, were given the opportunity to access each of several purpose-designed and built enrichment items. Each item was made freely available in the chimpanzees' regular setting, with their normal activities available. The time members of the group spent engaging with each item gave an assessment of their relative preference for the items. The group were shown to have the greatest preference for a foraging enrichment item (Screwfeeder) and the least preference for an audiovisual enrichment item (TV/Video). Individual preferences for the items were evident. The chimpanzees were then taught to operate a weighted lever to get access to an item. Once all chimpanzees had operated the lever for access to the items, the number of lever operations required for access to each item was systematically doubled over a series of 3 hr sessions until the chimpanzees did not gain any access to that item for two consecutive sessions. One item was presented for two series of increases. The group response rates for an item increased with increased response requirement and then decreased with further increases, reflecting data from individuals in other research. The highest response requirement that maintained the group behaviour differed over the items. The number of times an item was accessed (consumption) was plotted against the response requirement (price) on logarithmic coordinates. Lines fitted to the data (demand functions) were shallowest for a foraging enrichment (Screwfeeder) and steepest for the audio enrichment (Musicbox). There were not enough data points to fit a function for the audiovisual enrichment. Differences in individual's demand within the group were evident. In general, the rank order of preference for the items and the rank order based on the parameters of the demand functions (slope or elasticity and initial intensity) was broadly the same. Three individual chimpanzees were exposed to two series of increasing response requirement for access to the Screwfeeder whilst housed alone, in one hour sessions. Response rates were again bitonic and the linear demand functions for these individuals were steeper (more elastic) than the functions fitted to data for group responding and differed idiosyncratically from the data for these individual when responding as part of the group. Thus the change of social setting had a different impact on the behaviour of each of the individuals. These results show that an animals&#8223; demand for a commodity is altered by the environment in which it is tested. ii Overall the research provides the first example of operant methodology in a zoo setting with a group of chimpanzees. It is also the first research to show differential responding for access to different enrichment items by a group and how this relates to their preference (based on time allocation) for those items.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">operant methodology</field><field name="subject">chimpanzees</field><field name="subject">zoos</field><field name="subject">animal welfare and enrichment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agrobiodiversity Enhancement for the sustainability of the tropical uplands:  An evaluation of agricultural land use  in Liliw, Laguna, Philippines</field><field name="creator">Wagan, Amparo M.</field><field name="description">Agrobiodiversity Enhancement (ABDE) is a strategy that has been advanced for preventing environmental degradation without losing agricultural productivity. However, there is not yet sufficient evidence to support the important role that ABDE might have for managing agricultural land use in the tropical uplands. This research is an attempt to help fill this knowledge gap. The general aim of the thesis was to explore the potential of ABDE as a management alternative for agricultural land use in the uplands in terms of environmental protection, productivity and farmer acceptability. To achieve the aim, a methodological framework for evaluating agricultural land use in the uplands was developed. The methodology aimed at allowing one to understand the influence of agricultural land use on natural resources and farm productivity and the social factors that will most likely influence land users to enhance agrobiodiversity of their production. The methodological framework provided a minimum set of criteria and indicators that can be used for assessing agricultural land uses in the uplands. Main criteria for the evaluation included protection, productivity, viability security and acceptability. The following indicators were included: Shannon Diversity Index, Depth of Topsoil, Soil Organic Matter, Soil Nitrate, Crop Yields, Net Income, Trend in Income and Harvest Loss, Farmer Traits, Farm Characteristics and Farmer perceptions on the influence of farming on the health of natural resources and of the farm workers. The methodological framework also includes a range of methods and techniques for gathering environmental, economic and social data in the uplands and indicates circumstances under which each might best be utilized. Using the methodological framework, agricultural land use in an upland area in Liliw, Laguna Philippines was evaluated for protection of natural resources, specifically of the soil quality and for farm productivity and for the social factors that influence the way agricultural lands are managed. Results showed integration of horticultural trees and crops have potential for protecting thickness of the topsoil, reducing nutrient wastage and is more economically profitable than monocropping systems. Specifically, coconut exhibited importance in maintaining thickness of topsoil while lanzones played major role in augmenting farm income and as buffer to income losses from annual crops. Older farmers and women were found associated with agricultural land use with diversified production in the case study area. The Logit model analysis further showed that leadership quality and land ownership are the social factors that will likely influence integration of horticultural trees and crops in the uplands. Other personal characteristics like years of experience in farming, access to other sources of livelihood, land size, awareness of land degradation and effect of agrochemicals on heath of the farm workers have no likely influence on agricultural lands with integration of horticultural trees and crops. SWOT analysis of agricultural land use in the case study site showed that despite the environmental and economic advantages of agricultural lands with diversified production, there are weaknesses and barriers to its further development and implementation. From this assessment, implications for developing and implementing an ABDE intervention program for the tropical uplands were drawn.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agrobiodiversity Enhancement ABDE</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">agriculture</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="subject">tropical uplands</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Decay Fungi from New Zealand Leaky Buildings: Isolation, Identification and Preservative Resistance</field><field name="creator">Stahlhut, Dirk</field><field name="description">Leaky buildings are those that show elevated moisture contents of the framing timber, which can subsequently lead to the establishment of fungal and bacterial decay. Prior to this study, the causative agents of the decay in these leaky buildings were unknown, though it was suspected to be one or more species of decay fungi. Therefore, the overall goal of this multi-disciplinary PhD thesis research was to determine the causative agents of decay in leaky buildings of New Zealand in an effort to develop solutions for both their remediation and future prevention.  Use of molecular biology methodology and classical mycological techniques based on morphology enabled identification of decay fungi from framing timber and air samples of leaky New Zealand buildings and provided insight into relative importance based on isolation frequency. In most cases, fungi colonising Pinus radiata D. Don were isolated to produce pure cultures. Mycelia from these cultures on agar media were collected to extract DNA. To identify the fungi to the species level, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with fungal specific DNA primer pairs were performed followed by DNA sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Identification was by BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search on sequences in known GenBanks. In total, 421 samples from leaky buildings were processed, predominately untreated P. radiata decayed framing timber and also fibre cement boards and building paper. From these, sixty-eight fungal identifications were made. The only taxa that were isolated with significant frequency were identified as 4 basidiomycete species, as follows, along with the number of times they were isolated from the 421 samples:  &#8226;	Gloeophyllum sepiarium (Wulf.: Fr.) Karst.			13x &#8226;	Oligoporus placenta (Fries 1865) Gilb. In Ryv.1985		11x &#8226;	Antrodia sinuosa (Fr.) Karst.			  		  8x &#8226;	Gloeophyllum trabeum (Fr.) Murr.		  		  4x Although these species were identified repeatedly, in total they represent less than 10% of the total samples and, therefore, it is concluded that the leaky building decay samples represent high fungal biodiversity.  An aerial spore study of internal air, wall cavity air and exterior air of leaky buildings was carried out using a Merck MAS-100 instrument which collects spores directly onto selective media plates. Viable fungal aerial spores were detected at every sampling location tested at the leaky buildings, by the criteria of culturing, with a highest mean of 3714 colony-forming units (CFU) per cubic metre found in the cavities of water-damaged walls. This aerial spore study in conjunction with isolation from decayed wood samples from the same leaky buildings enabled identification of G. sepiarium and A. sinuosa at the same test site. The use of carboxymethylcellulose medium further demonstrated the presence of potential cellulose-degrading fungi within and around the location. Overall, the combination of direct sampling of timber and air sampling proved useful for detection of fungal species variability at a multi-unit building.  Four decay fungi isolated from New Zealand leaky buildings and two standard control decay fungi (Coniophora puteana and Serpula lacrymans) were submitted to laboratory wood block testing to determine the effectiveness of currently used wood framing preservatives under laboratory conditions before and after a standard leaching regime. P. radiata blocks were treated with water based boron  copper azole and solvent based IPBC  propiconazole plus tebuconazole (1:1) preservatives and exposed to the basidiomycetes for 12 weeks. Mass loss for the fungal decay-infected samples was recorded of up to 55% for preservative-treated samples, up to 62% mass loss for leached samples and up to 58% mass loss for un-preservative treated samples. Additionally, well defined dosage responses and approximate toxic thresholds were obtained for all preservatives tested. Results suggested that the minimum IPBC retention specified by Hazard Class 1.2 of NZS3640:2003 (0.025% m/m) is on the low side, and demonstrated after the 2 week leaching regime complete loss of efficacy of boron at 0.4% m/m boric acid equivalent (BAE). This PhD research gave a first overview of fungi occurring in New Zealand leaky buildings, and it demonstrated the following key aspects of wood preservation:  1.	The isolated test fungus Antrodia sinuosa was more difficult to control with propiconazole plus tebuconazole at retention 0.007% m/m than the known tolerant fungus Oligoporus placenta; 2.	Boron at Hazard Class 1.2 retention of 0.4% m/m BAE was not toxic to Oligoporus placenta; 3.	Serpula lacrymans exhibited tolerance to the highest retention of 0.06 %m/m tebuconazole plus propiconazole; and 4.	Gloeophyllum species appeared susceptible to all wood preservatives.  In order to correlate fungal colonisation and wood decay, colonised wood blocks were studied using light microscopy (LM) and field- emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Microscopic observations of P. radiata wood blocks following a standard wood decay test of twelve weeks of fungal colonisation by Serpula lacrymans, Antrodia sinuosa, Oligoporus placenta and Gloeophyllum sepiarium revealed that the two microscopic techniques employed were complementary by allowing features such as pit membranes, chlamydospores or S3/S2 compound middle lamella interface to be photographed in greater detail, allowing for more precise analyses and interpretation of key findings, as follows:  1.	Brown rot fungi directly target their apical growth towards degraded pit apetures; 2.	Reliance on light microscopy and observed birefringence as a tool to record changes in cell wall crystallinity associated with brown rot decay alone could be misleading; 3.	Presence of fine (&#8804; 1 m) to wide (&#8805; 3.5  m) bore-hole and hyphal size ranges, and nearly unchanged cell wall thickness of all wood/test fungal combinations, confirmed active decay at moderate to late stages; 4.	Some ray parenchyma cells for Antrodia sinuosa, Oligoporus placenta and Gloeophyllum sepiarium colonised blocks were intact throughout late stages of decay, outlining that they were not preferentially degraded early in the brown rot decay process, and 5.	Presence of bore-holes, clamp and medallion clamp formation and resting spores (chlamydospores and arthrospores) are fungal specific, can aid in their differentiation and identification, and should be recorded during wood decay studies, as especially resting spores are an important factor when planning remediation strategies.  In summary, this PhD thesis research provided the first comprehensive investigation into the biodiversity of fungi from leaky New Zealand buildings, identified the dominant species and presented details about their micromorphology and their decay patterns. It also demonstrated substantial differences in efficacy of preservative formulations currently (December 2008) approved for framing treatments in New Zealand and possible deficiencies where framing may be subjected to severe leaching. This study also provided the first comparative analyses of viable fungal aerial spores between leaky wall cavities and the surrounding air environment. Subsequently, this research added to the knowledge of the decay fungal species diversity in and around New Zealand leaky buildings, outlined their capabilities to degrade treated and un-treated P. radiata framing timber and illustrated the efficacy of New Zealand approved wood preservatives for their potential as remedial treatment and future prevention.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Leaky Buildings</field><field name="subject">Pinus radiata</field><field name="subject">PCR-polymerase chain reaction</field><field name="subject">colony forming units</field><field name="subject">aerial spores</field><field name="subject">brown rot</field><field name="subject">Oligoporus placenta</field><field name="subject">Gloeophyllum sp.</field><field name="subject">Antrodia sinuosa</field><field name="subject">Copper azole</field><field name="subject">boron</field><field name="subject">IPBC</field><field name="subject">Tebuconazole/Propiconazole</field><field name="subject">decay micromorphology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the use of a human behaviour model for natural resource policy design and implementation by government (central and regional) agencies</field><field name="creator">Parminter, Terry Graham</field><field name="description">In recent years, one of the most significant pieces of environmental legislation in New Zealand has been the Resource Management Act (New Zealand Government 1991) that has empowered local government agencies to manage the use of natural resources in their regions.  Three Government Departments have been responsible for developing policies directly relating to the use of natural resources in New Zealand.  The Department of Conservation has been mainly concerned with the management of natural resources on public land.  The Ministry for the Environment has particularly addressed environmental policy issues of national significance.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has worked with New Zealand's agricultural, horticultural and forestry industries to encourage sustainable resource use and development for the benefit of all New Zealanders. In general, local and central government agencies carrying out policy analyses have drawn upon highly goal driven theories such as Rational Choice or Incremental Policy Theories or alternatively they have applied more loosely framed theories such as Systems Policy Thinking or Garbage Can Theory.  Policy formulation and instrument selection may have been based upon instrumentalist, proceduralist, contingentist or constitutivist selection criteria, depending upon the assumed influence of peoples' behavioural and social contexts in addition to the technical characteristics of the tools themselves.  However, there has been a limited range of policy theories to guide the integration of policy analysis, and formulation and operational planning into a management strategy for effective policy delivery.  Such theories would have assisted policy agencies to identify the human and social behaviours most closely related to policy issues and to better match policies to differences in the political and social context of each of the issues that they were dealing with. In academic articles a number of behaviour models from social psychology have been used to explain and predict human behaviour.  One of those, the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) has a long history of use in research and application.  It has been adapted to suit the needs of policy makers in human health, marketing, and education.  Applications of the TRA have been reported to have achieved coefficients of determination for behaviour of on average, 53% in one study and 71% in another.  Some of the modified models based upon the Theory such as the Theory of Planned Behaviour, have in themselves been able to make additional contributions to peoples' understanding of how to explain and predict human behaviour in more complex situations.  In this report, unless otherwise stated, references to the TRA are inclusive of all associated models, such as the Theory of Planned Behaviour. This thesis has examined the application of the Theory of Reasoned Action in the formulation of environmental policy.  Five research questions were considered. 1.	Could a human behaviour model based upon the Theory of Reasoned Action be developed sufficiently for environmental policy makers to explain landowner behaviour associated with managing indigenous vegetation? 2.	How well could the social psychology model of human behaviour based upon the TRA have predicted public responses to a policy programme? 3.	How well could the social psychology model of human behaviour based upon the TRA have distinguished between the policy-intervention needs of different stakeholder groups? 4.	How much have peoples' values, attitudes and beliefs affected their behaviour? 5.	What would be the immediate antecedents to peoples' behaviour and how have they led to behaviour change?  This has been a quantitative study to develop and test models of human behaviour specific to the preservation of indigenous vegetation.  Three data sets were compared from surveys of peoples' bush protection behaviour, the establishment of indigenous woodlots and the protection and planting of riparian areas with indigenous vegetation.  The results from the analyses have shown that accounting for peoples' intentions could have been used to improve the estimates of peoples' use of policy-desired practices.  The coefficients of determination in multivariate equations to predict peoples' natural resource behaviour based upon non-specific (external) variables, varied between 3 - 10%.  By including intentions in the models, the level of explanation increased to 10 - 17%.  The results may have been lower than expected from other examples in the literature due to poorly specified measures of behaviour relative to the measures used for intentions. When it came to estimating intentions (rather than the actual behaviours), the TRA variables in regression equations achieved coefficients of determination of 55 - 75% and these provided a measure of how well the underlying values, attitudes and beliefs could have given policy makers an understanding of peoples' behaviour.  Comparing the beliefs of people with high and low intentions to perform the behaviours, clear differences have been identified that could have been the basis of policy strategies for behaviour change. After analysing and considering these examples, this thesis has argued that the TRA could be used in the future to provide policy agencies with an increased level of understanding of human behaviour and so enable them to formulate policy interventions for achieving predictable levels of behaviour change.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theory of resoned action</field><field name="subject">indigenous vegetation</field><field name="subject">riparian protection</field><field name="subject">indigenous woodlots</field><field name="subject">policy formulation</field><field name="subject">theory of planned behaviour</field><field name="subject">strategic design</field><field name="subject">environmental policy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finding synergistic conservation values? M&#257;ori tikanga, science, resource management and law</field><field name="creator">Simon, Katie</field><field name="description">In this doctorate, I provide a balanced and collaborative approach to knowledge/value change between the contesting worldviews of indigenous knowledge and western science, termed 'synergistic'. My search for synergy is comparative and reconciliatory. This endeavours to overcome the popular pre-occupation with conflict and opposition. Rather, both difference and similarity are recognised. Through the comparison of such synergy, I argue that M&#257;ori development requires for its further advancement a focus not only on difference and conflict, but also on affinity and convergence.  My primary concern is to establish a better understanding of the synergistic, adaptive strategies or indigenous innovation of M&#257;ori kaitiaki, environmental stewards. I investigate conflicting and converging M&#257;ori and western scientific conservation and use values in Aotearoa/New Zealand  environmental governance and management regimes under the Resource Management Act 1991, with specific regard to indicator development. The balance of values were compared in ecological environmental governance, from five Aotearoa governmental authorities and three M&#257;ori river communities, utilising M&#257;ori and western social science methods. My focus on indicators pinpoints contesting knowledge/value change between the marginalisation of indigenous knowledge and dominance of western science. This seeks to highlight the potential viability of M&#257;ori kaitiakitanga, stewardship in global and national terms of sustainability.  However, potential synergy is held back by a prevailing viewpoint of the indigenous worldview as backward, past-oriented and non-synergistic. An oppositional dogma predominates, which is a key problem to overcome. It spans world and national literature, resulting in considerable gaps in knowledge on synergy, conceptually, methodologically, empirically and analytically.  This is addressed by an authoritative M&#257;ori synergistic standpoint from my own cultural lens and decolonised theorising, termed 'nuanced problem solving'. I articulate both worldviews in knowledge/value change through comparative, evolutionary, multi-dimensional, cross-cultural and inter-disciplinary research on synergy. My nuanced problem solving encapsulates the two main parts of the doctorate, whereby synergy is correlated between theory and social practice. Part one deals with value comparison in theory utilising high abstracted concepts and methods at the global level of environmental governance. Part two deals with value balance in social practice utilising medium abstracted and concrete empirical and analytical research at global, national, regional, district and cross-tribal levels of environmental governance. Potential synergy cross-cuts each part from high abstracted thought down and from the practical flax roots up. I argue that M&#257;ori advancement fluctuates between them. Drawing on cultural and theoretical leanings of the M&#257;ori synergistic standpoint, both a strong correlation with existing theory and expanded synergistic theorising was found. Due to the expansiveness of the research, these correlated findings only provide an embryonic understanding of potential synergy.  A postscript describes my other work on synergy with five external agencies concerning foreshore, lakeside, wastewater, land disposal and carbon marketing kaitiakitanga.  I argue that additional research on synergy is needed in order to further advance M&#257;ori.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous knowledge</field><field name="subject">western science</field><field name="subject">kaitiakitanga</field><field name="subject">synergy</field><field name="subject">indicators</field><field name="subject">environmental governance</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">resource management</field><field name="subject">tikanga</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variation in 'Hayward' kiwifruit quality characteristics</field><field name="creator">Woodward, Tim</field><field name="description">Quantify the magnitude, sources and distribution of variation in fruit quality traits within kiwifruit populations and identify opportunities for the management of this variation.  Near-infrared (NIR) grading was used as a tool for monitoring fruit quality, and measurements combined with orchard/vine information to investigate opportunities for the management of the variation in fruit quality traits with a particular focus on fruit DM. NIR enabled non-destructive assessment of the quality characteristics of individual fruit from 96 commercial orchards, comprising 550 fruit-lines, across four consecutive seasons, resulting in a dataset of measurements made on 146.7 million individual fruit. The distribution of quality traits within fruit populations and the relationships between quality traits were examined. The spatial component of variation in fruit quality was investigated to assess the potential for zonal management practices. Finally, the effects of growth temperatures on fruit quality were studied.  Significant variation in fruit quality was observed between-seasons, between-orchards, and between-vines within an orchard. From comparison of CVs between quality traits, cropload was more variable than fruit weight which varied more than fruit DM, independent of the production scale considered (between-orchard or between-vine). Across a hierarchy of fruit populations (individual vine, fruit-line and orchard), the majority of fruit quality distributions demonstrated significant deviations from normality. However, departures from normality can be tolerated for estimation of the proportion of fruit with specific quality criteria. The sources of variation in fruit weight and DM populations were investigated at both a between-orchard scale and a within-orchard scale. Between-orchard variation was significant, however, the majority of variation occurred within-fruitlines, within-orchards and within seasons. The within-fruitline component of variation was investigated separately. Both between-vine and within-vine variation were significant, but within-vine variation was dominant. The focus of management should be on reducing variation occurring within-fruitlines within-orchards, which is largely attributable to variation occurring within the individual vine.  Higher croploads per vine have negative consequences for fruit weight but variable effects on DM. Increasing croploads reduce both FW and DW allocations for each fruit, therefore the effect of cropload on DM is dependent on the relative reductions in FW and DW. The DW allocations to fruit are not limited by DW production, at least up to the croploads observed in this study (&#8804;65 fruit m-2).  The potential for zonal management was investigated. Variation in fruit quality characteristics between-orchards across the Te Puke growing region, and between-vines within an individual orchard area were investigated using geostatistics. A spatial component to variation was identified both between-orchard and between-vine. However, the effect of spatial variation was diluted by that of non-spatial variation and therefore, zonation between orchards or between areas within-orchards should not be where the effort in managing variation is concentrated. Orchard altitude correlated with some aspects of fruit quality. Mean fruit weight declined 0.5g and within-orchard variation in fruit weight declined 0.25 units with a 25m increase in orchard altitude. Mean fruit DM was independent of orchard altitude and within-orchard variability in DM declined 0.023 units per 25m increase in orchard altitude. Differences in orchard altitude equated with differences in growth temperatures. Warm spring and cool summer temperatures favour the growth of high DM fruit. The effects of spring temperatures on canopy development and maturation were investigated to elucidate potential physiological mechanisms for temperatures effects on fruit growth. Higher spring growth temperatures increased the rate of total leaf area development and promoted development of leaf photosynthesis. Higher spring growth temperatures favoured a more positive carbon balance, which has beneficial effects on the development of fruit quality characteristics.  Post-harvest, the traditional practice of grading fruit into count sizes generally also segregates for DM, and large count size fruit will often have higher DM than small sized fruit. Between fruit populations, a positive correlation was identified between fruit DM and acidity; therefore, segregation of the inventory by DM will also segregate for acidity. High DM fruit are also more acidic with a higher, more favourable brix/acid ratio when ripe. It is recommended that fruit DM status be managed in the inventory, not by maturity area as is the current practice, but by groups of similar count sizes within maturity areas.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kiwifruit</field><field name="subject">Hayward</field><field name="subject">fruit</field><field name="subject">quality</field><field name="subject">spatial variation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2640</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impacts of climate change on cattle water demand and supply in Khurutshe, Botswana</field><field name="creator">Masike, Sennye</field><field name="description">The primary question that the thesis investigates is: what impacts could climate change have on cattle water demand and supply in Khurutshe, Botswana. This thesis is pursued in light of the fact that there is a lack of knowledge on climate change and cattle water demand and supply. Thus, this thesis aims at filling the gap in knowledge on climate change and cattle water resources in Botswana and other semi-arid environments. A cattle water demand and supply model is developed to investigate the primary question of the thesis. The model is driven by rainfall and temperature over time as these variables largely determine cattle water supply and demand, respectively. Climate scenarios for 2050 are constructed using SimCLIM (developed by the International Global Change Institute of the University of Waikato) based on HadCM3 and CSIRO Mk2 General Circulation Models (GCMs). Three Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) are used: A1B, A1FT and A1T. These emission scenarios were selected based on their coverage for possible future Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHG). Climate scenarios show that by 2050 the temperature for the Khurutshe area could increase by as much as 3 oC depending on the GCM and SRES emission scenario and that there could be a decline in rainfall of up to 14% per month. CSIRO Mk2 displayed the maximum decline in rainfall while HadCM3 depicted the maximum increase in temperature.  The model is implemented in the Khurutshe of the Kgatleng District, Botswana. The results reported are for Masama Ranch and also for the whole of the Khurutshe area. The results show that climate change could lead to an annual increase of more than 20% in cattle water demand by 2050 due to an increase in temperature. In addition, climate change could lead to a decline in the contribution of surface pan water to cattle water supply. Overall, there could be an increase in abstraction of groundwater for cattle by 2050 due to an increase in demand and a decline in forage water content and surface pan water. Observations in semi-arid environments of Africa indicate that farmers encounter problems of declining borehole yields and local depletion in groundwater in summer and drought years when demand peaks. In addition, it has been observed that during drought more cattle are lost as a result of lack of water, particularly for those whose cattle are reliant on surface water. Thus, the results from this study indicate that climate change could enhance this problem. In the thesis I have shown the importance of integrating climate change impacts on water demand and supply when assessing water resources, which has been ignored in the past. Some of the policy options that are discussed are tradable pumping permits for controlling abstraction and allocation issues in the Khurutshe aquifer and, controlling stocking numbers. This is in recognition of the fact that climate change could result in more reliance on groundwater for both cattle farming and urban water supply hence compromising sustainability and allocation issues especially for the Khurutshe aquifer which is earmarked to supply the city of Gaborone and surrounding villages in drought periods.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cattle</field><field name="subject">water demand</field><field name="subject">water supply</field><field name="subject">forage water content</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">system dynamics modeling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sequestration of metal and metalloid ions by thermophilic bacteria</field><field name="creator">Hetzer, Adrian</field><field name="description">This Ph. D. thesis presents results and conclusions from studies 1) investigating the interaction between metal and metalloid ions and thermophilic bacteria, and 2) characterizing microbial populations in a geothermally active habitat with relatively high concentrations of metalloid ions and compounds.  In initial cadmium ion toxicity assays, the minimal inhibition concentration for 46 thermophilic bacteria of the genera Aneurinibacillus, Anoxybacillus, Bacillus, Brevibacillus, Geobacillus, and Thermus were determined. The highest tolerances to cadmium ions (Cd2+) in the range of 400 to 3200 micro;M were observed for species belonging to the genus Geobacillus. The thermophilic Gram-positive bacteria Geobacillus stearothermophilus and G. thermocatenulatus were selected to describe further biosorption reactions between cadmium ions and chemically reactive functional groups (potential ligands) within and onto the bacterial cell walls. Data obtained from electrophoretic mobility, potentiometric titration and cadmium ion adsorption experiments were used to quantify the number and concentrations of ligands and to determine the thermodynamic stability constants for the ligand-cation complexes. The first reported surface complexation models (SCMs) quantifying metal ion adsorption by thermophilic microorganisms predicted cadmium adsorption and desorption by both studied Geobacillus strains over a range of pH values and for different biomasses. The results indicated the functional group, with a deprotonation constant pK value of approximately 3.8, to be more dominant in cation biosorption accounting for 66 and 80% of all titrable groups for G. thermocatenulatus and G. stearothermophilus, respectively. The generated SCMs are different from model parameters obtained from mesophilic species that have been studied to date and might indicate a different biosorption behavior for both studied Geobacillus strains.  Another objective of this thesis was to characterize microbial populations in the hot spring Champagne Pool, located in Waiotapu, New Zealand. The thermal spring is approximately 65 m in diameter and discharges water at 75eg; C and pH 5.5, which is oversaturated with arsenic and antimony compounds that precipitate and form orange deposits. Recovered nucleic acids and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) concentrations obtained for Champagne Pool water samples indicated low microbial density and were in good agreement with relatively low cell numbers of 5.6 plusmn; 0.5 x10^6 cells per ml. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16S rRNA gene clone library analyses revealed the abundance of Sulfurihydrogenibium, Sulfolobus and Thermofilum-like populations in Champagne Pool. Two novel bacteria and one novel archaeon were successfully isolated with a distant phylogenetic relationship to Sulfurihydrogenibium, Thermoanaerobacter, and Thermococcus, respectively. Genotypic and metabolic characteristics differentiated isolate CP.B2 from described species of the genus Sulfurihydrogenibium. CP.B2 represents a novel genus within the Aquificales order, for which the name Venenivibrio stagnispumantis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. V. stagnispumantis is a thermophilic, chemolithothrophic bacterium, that utilizes molecular hydrogen as electron donor and oxygen as electron acceptor and displayed growth in the presence of up to 8 mM NaAsO2 (As3+) and more than 20 mM Na2HAsO4.7H2O (As5+). However, growth was not observed when Na2HAsO4.7H2O and NaAsO2 were provided as the sole electron acceptor and donor pair.

The Waitaki River catchment is located in the centre of the South Island of New Zealand, and produces 35-40% of New Zealand's electricity. Low inflow years in 1992 and 2001 resulted in the threat of power blackouts, and a national demand for electricity that is currently growing at 2 to 5% a year gives strong justification for better management of the hydro resource. Improved seasonal rainfall and inflow forecasts will result in the better management of the water used in hydro generation on a seasonal basis. Seasonal rainfall forecasting has been the focus of much international research in recent years, but seasonal inflow forecasting is in its relative infancy. Researchers have stated that key directions for both fields are to decrease the spatial scale of forecast products, and to tailor forecast products to end user needs, so as to provide more relevant and targeted forecasts, which will hopefully decrease the enormous socio-economic costs of climate fluctuations.  This study calibrated several season ahead lake inflow and rainfall forecast models for the Waitaki river catchment, using statistical techniques to quantify relationships between land-ocean-atmosphere state variables and seasonally lagged inflows and rainfall. Techniques included principal components analysis and multiple linear regression, with cross-validation techniques applied to estimate model error. Many of both the continuous and discrete format models calibrated in this study predict anomalously wet and dry seasons better than random chance, and better than the long term mean as a predictor. 95% confidence limits around most model predictions in this study offer significant skill when compared with the range of all probable inflows (based on the 80 year recording history in the catchment). Models predicting winter Lake Pukaki inflows are those with the strongest predictive relationships in this study. Spring and summer predictions were generally less skilful than those for winter and autumn. Inflows could be predicted with some skill in winter and summer, but not rainfall, and rainfall could be predicted with some skill in autumn and spring, but not inflows. Models predicting inflows and rainfall for different seasons in this study use very different sets of predictor variables to accomplish their seasonal predictability. This may be related to the significant seasonal snow storage in the catchment, so that other factors such as temperature and the number of north-westerly storms may have a large part to play in the magnitude of inflows. Similarly, predicting the same dependent variable but for different seasons led to different contributing variables, leading to the conclusion that different wider physical causative mechanisms are behind the predictability in different seasons, and that they too should be studied separately in any future research. SST5 (sea surface temperature to the north of New Zealand) was found to have more relevance than any other predictor in predicting Waitaki river inflows and rainfall in any season. The models calibrated with SOI and IPO included as predictor variables were almost invariably worse in their predictive skill than those without, and the list of the most important predictor variables in all models did not include equatorial sea surface temperatures, sea level pressures, or 700hpa geopotential height variables. The conclusion from these findings is that equatorial ocean-atmosphere state variables do not have significant relationships with season ahead inflows and rainfall in the South Island of New Zealand.  Seasonal climate forecasting on single catchment scale, and focussed to end user needs, is possible with some skill, at least in the South Island of New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Seasonal forecasting</field><field name="subject">hydro inflows</field><field name="subject">rainfall</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Once an Other, always an Other: Contemporary discursive representations of the Asian Other in Aotearoa/New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Cormack, Donna Moana</field><field name="description">Developments in the theorising of representation and the constitutive nature of language have encouraged an increased scholarly interest in the discursive construction of social identities, relations, and realities.  This includes a growing body of literature internationally that focuses on the construction of social groups positioned as Others.  However, critical research in this area is more limited in the domestic setting.  In Aotearoa/New Zealand, the contemporary construction of social identities is embedded within a specific socio-political and historical context, including a particular colonial context.  This context is fundamental to the ways in which social relations between the white settler Self and various Other groups have been, and continue to be, constituted.   In this thesis, I have explored the discursive representation of Asian identity in dominant institutional discourses in Aotearoa/New Zealand, with a particular focus on the construction of the Asian as Other.  Using critical discourse analysis, contemporary newspaper and parliamentary texts were examined to identify content areas, discursive strategies, and lexical choices involved in the representation of the Asian Other by elite institutions in Aotearoa/New Zealand.  Through this process, several recurring manifestations of Asian Otherness were recognised, namely those of Asians as threat, Asian as impermanent, Asian as commodity, and Asian as victim.  These representations of the Asian Other embody continuities and contradictions.  They function to contribute to contemporary understandings and positionings of Asian individuals and collectives, to the ongoing construction of the Self in Aotearoa/New Zealand, and to the broader national narrative.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">Asian</field><field name="subject">representation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Derivation and Application of a Theoretically and Economically Consistent Version of the Nelson and Siegel Class of Yield Curve Models</field><field name="creator">Krippner, Leo</field><field name="description">A popular class of yield curve models is based on the Nelson and Siegel (1987) (hereafter NS) approach of  fitting  yield curve data with simple functions of maturity. However, NS models are not theoretically consistent and they also lack an economic foundation, which limits their wider application in finance and economics. This thesis derives an intertemporally-consistent and arbitrage-free version of the NS model, and provides an explicit macroeconomic foundation for that augmented NS (ANS) model. To illustrate the general applicability of the ANS model, it is then applied to four distinct topics spanning finance and economics, each of which are active areas of research in their own right: i.e (1) forecasting the yield curve; (2) investigating relationships between the yield curve and the macroeconomy; (3) fixed interest portfolio management; and (4) investigating the uncovered interest parity hypothesis (UIPH). In each application, the ANS model allows the formal derivation of a parsimonious theoretical framework that captures the essence of the topic under investigation and is readily applicable in practice. Respectively: (1) the intertemporal consistency embedded in the ANS model results in a vector-autoregressive equation that projects the future yield curve from the current yield curve, and forecasts from that model outperform the random-walk benchmark; (2) the economic foundation for the ANS model leads to a single-equation relationship between the current shape of the yield curve and the magnitude and timing of future output growth, and empirical estimations confirm that the theoretical relationship holds in practice; (3) the ANS model provides a theoretically-consistent framework for quantifying risk and returns in fixed interest portfolios, and portfolios optimised ex-ante using that framework outperform a passive benchmark; and (4) the ANS model allows interest rates to be decomposed into a component related to economic fundamentals in the underlying economy, and a component related to cyclical influences. Empirical tests based on the fundamental interest rate components do not reject the UIPH, while the UIPH is rejected based on the cyclical interest rate components. This provides empirical support for suggestions in the theoretical literature that interest rate and exchange rate dynamics associated with cyclical interlinkages between the economy and financial markets under rational expectations may contribute materially to the UIPH puzzle.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">yield curve</field><field name="subject">term structure of interest rates</field><field name="subject">Nelson-Seigel</field><field name="subject">Heath-Jarrow-Morton</field><field name="subject">macrofinance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural Economics: The Inferior-Good Effect</field><field name="creator">Messick, Eric Michael</field><field name="description">These experiments used 15 domestic hens to investigate the inferior-good effect, a decrease in consumption of a commodity as income increases.  Experiment 1 investigated plain and salted wheat to serve as superior goods (opposite to inferior goods) and inferior goods.  Hens consumed mostly plain wheat when given ad-libitum access so it was the intended superior good and salted wheat was the intended inferior good.  In the next experiments, 3 s of plain wheat and 10 s of salted wheat were available for single responses on 2 keys during discrete trials.  Income changed by changing the inter-trial interval (ITI) of fixed-length sessions or the total number of trials.  Experiment 2 partially replicated the Silberberg et al. (1987) procedure, using the ITI income analogue for 6 hens.  When income increased, 4 hens sometimes responded less on the salted-wheat key (demonstrating the inferior-good effect), 2 of these hens and a 5th hen sometimes responded more on both keys but proportionally more on the plain-wheat key (termed here as a relative inferior-good effect).  Experiment 3a partially replicated the Hastjarjo et al. (1990a) procedure using the total-trials analogue for 7 other hens.  The inferior-good effect occurred across some conditions for 2 hens while other hens tended to respond on the plain-wheat key, suggesting lack of contingency contact.  When a 60-s ITI was added in Experiment 3b, variability increased for most hens, but only 1 hen showed the effect, 1 of the hens that did so in Experiment 3b.  These 6 hens' (1 died) 80% bodyweights were re-assessed in Experiment 4 and hens were below 80% during Experiments 3a and 3b, suggesting that the lack of the inferior-good effect was not due to some hens being at high weights.  The ITI analogue was used for these 6 hens in Experiment 5 and the effect occurred for 2 hens.  Experiment 6 added forced-choice trials to the total-trials analogue (with 60-s ITI) to guarantee contingency contact.  The inferior- and/or relative-inferior-good effect occurred for 3 hens.  Across Experiments 2 through 6, body weights were usually heavier in high-income conditions and a within-session pattern of early-salted-late-plain responding occasionally occurred.   Crop capacities  of 5 Experiment-2 hens and a new hen (1 died) were assessed in Experiment 7 and there was no relation between this measure and inferior-or relative-inferior-good effects.  Experiments 8 and 9 examined effects of pre- and post-feed in low-income conditions using the ITI analogue.  When hens were pre-fed, responding for 5 of 7 hens resembled responding in high-income conditions of Experiment 2 with more plain-wheat responding and similar or less salted-wheat responding in some conditions (behaviour similar to the inferior- and relative-inferior-good effects, but without the income change).  A similar pattern was found for 4 of 5 hens when hens were post-fed in Experiment 9, suggesting that food in the digestive tract may have played a role, and perhaps not the income manipulations themselves, where it (or other component of body weight) may have abolished quantity (i.e., the intended-inferior-good) as a reinforcer.  Although these experiments occasionally demonstrated inferior- and relative-inferior-good effects, but less convincingly than published studies, the effects of income may have been non-specific.  The usefulness of the inferior-good concept and other income-related economic concepts are thus challenged.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">behavioural economics</field><field name="subject">inferior good</field><field name="subject">income</field><field name="subject">choice</field><field name="subject">consumption</field><field name="subject">body weight</field><field name="subject">crop</field><field name="subject">gallus domesticus</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Becoming a Teacher: An Investigation of the Transition from Student Teacher to Teacher</field><field name="creator">Grudnoff, Alexandra Barbara</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to gain greater knowledge of the process of transition and development that beginning primary teachers undergo over their first year of teaching. The research focus is on investigating and understanding this process from the standpoint of the beginning teacher. Of particular interest is an examination of how the teacher preparation programme, contextual features of the school, and participants' own beliefs and biographies influence and impact on their transition to teaching and their professional and identity development as first year teachers. This longitudinal study takes an interpretive approach to investigate the first year teaching experiences of 12 beginning teachers in 11 primary schools. The qualitative methodology used in this thesis shares characteristics with a case study approach and utilizes procedures associated with grounded theory. Data were gathered systematically over a year by way of 48 semi-structured, individual interviews, two focus group interviews, and 48 questionnaires, supplemented by field notes. The collected data were analyzed, coded, and categorized, and explanations and theory that emerged from this process were grounded in the data. The findings of this study have three broad sets of implications for the education and induction of beginning teachers. Firstly, they question the role that practicum plays in the transition from student to teacher. The findings suggest that the practicum component of teacher preparation programmes should be re-conceptualized and redesigned to provide authentic opportunities for student teachers to be exposed to the full range of work demands and complexity that they will encounter as beginning teachers. Secondly, becoming a successful teacher appears to depend on the quality of the school's professional and social relationships, particularly in terms of the frequency and type of formal and informal interactions that ii beginning teachers have with colleagues. While the major source of satisfaction and self-esteem came from seeing the children whom they taught achieving socially and academically, the beginning teachers also had a strong need for affiliation, which was enabled through positive, structured interactions and relationships with colleagues. The study also indicates that employment status influences the way that the beginning teachers view their work and themselves as teachers, with those in relieving positions displaying greater variability in terms of emotional reactions and a sense of professional confidence than those employed in permanent positions. The third set of implications relate to beginning teacher induction. The study points to variability in the quality of induction experiences and challenges policy makers and principals to ensure that all beginning teachers are provided with sound and systematic advice and guidance programmes which are necessary for their learning and development. While the study confirms the critical role played by tutor teachers in beginning teacher induction, it suggests that the focus is on emotional and practical support rather than on educative mentoring to enhance new teachers' thinking and practice. This thesis provides a comprehensive and nuanced view of how beginning to teach is experienced and interpreted. It paints a complex picture of the relationship between biography, beliefs, preparation, and context in the process of learning to teach. The study contributes to the literature on the education of beginning teachers. It highlights the need for developing a shared understanding amongst policy makers, teacher educators, and schools regarding the multiplicity and complexity of factors that influence the transition and development of beginning teachers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teacher preparation programmes</field><field name="subject">teacher preparation</field><field name="subject">teaching experiences</field><field name="subject">beginning teachers</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General Knowledge? The Roles of the New Zealand University in a Knowledge Society</field><field name="creator">Reid, Grant Horace John</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the roles of the New Zealand university in a knowledge society. Gaps in the literature of the New Zealand university in a contemporary context mean that the enquiry is informed by European and North American discussions of the educational requirements of a knowledge society. As the notions of the knowledge society and a liberal university education are both problematic and central to this enquiry, they are interrogated, in the second chapter, in some depth.	  A second review examines the work, recommendations and subsequent legislative outcomes of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission (TEAC) policy process of 1999 to 2003. The principles of critical theory and critical policy scholarship inform these interpretative textual analyses. The two review chapters, which follow the introductory chapter, comprise the first part of the thesis. A description of the methodological framework employed throughout the project and a report of the findings of a survey of stakeholders follow. The discussion chapter comprises the third and final part of the thesis. The thesis seeks to distinguish the notion of the knowledge society from that of the neo-liberal approach to social and economic management. I argue that the notion of the knowledge society is viable in a range of socio-economic conditions. I suggest that the educational requirements of a knowledge society are better addressed when the scope of a university education is framed by holistic individual, social, and economic determinants, rather than rigid ideological imperatives such as those characteristic of neo-liberalism. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies is employed. Primary data are gathered by way of a postal questionnaire. The perceptions of three cohorts of stakeholders of the New Zealand university are analysed using both statistical and interpretative tools. Data gathered through a review of the literature of the university in relation to the notion of the knowledge society in New Zealand, North America, and various European contexts are analysed using a combination of critical and interpretive approaches. The major finding to emerge from the enquiry is that stakeholders of the New Zealand university associate an effective university education with breadth of learning. The notion of a liberal university education, with its attendant beyond-vocation curriculum assumptions, is not considered anachronistic by the majority of stakeholders surveyed during this project. Public and private sector employers and university students strongly associate a liberal university education with effective preparation for participation in a knowledge-intensive environment. Year 13 secondary students are less certain. A secondary finding is that most stakeholders consider that the research activities of the university academic should continue to inform university teaching, but that the teaching role is of growing importance, and therefore worthy of greater emphasis, in the context of a knowledge society. The project is intended to provoke further discussion around the relationship between the New Zealand university and the knowledge society. To date there has been little academic consideration of this relationship. The contribution of this thesis, relative to this gap, is therefore significant.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">liberal education</field><field name="subject">role of university</field><field name="subject">knowledge society</field><field name="subject">knowledge economy</field><field name="subject">vocational education</field><field name="subject">teaching and research</field><field name="subject">university teaching</field><field name="subject">academic freedom</field><field name="subject">repository of knowledge</field><field name="subject">broad education</field><field name="subject">critical thinking</field><field name="subject">knowledge for its own sake</field><field name="subject">neoliberalism</field><field name="subject">critical scholarship</field><field name="subject">critical theory</field><field name="subject">poststructuralism</field><field name="subject">postmodernist</field><field name="subject">Enlightenment</field><field name="subject">universalism</field><field name="subject">modernist</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Credit loss dynamics in Australasian banking</field><field name="creator">Hess, Kurt</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the drivers and dynamics of credit losses in Australasian banking over an extended period of time in order to improve the means by which financial institutions manage their credit risks and regulatory bodies safeguard the stability and integrity of the financial system. The analysis is based on a specially constructed data base of credit loss and provisioning data retrieved from original financial reports published by Australian and New Zealand banks. The observation period covers 1980 to 2005, starting at the time when such information was published for the first time in bank financial statements. It moreover covers the time of major crises which occurred in both Australia and New Zealand in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The heterogeneity of reporting the data both amongst banks and through time requires the development of a reporting typology which allows data extraction with equivalent informational content. As a thorough study of credit risks requires long data series often not available from third party data providers, the method developed here will provide value to a range of researchers. Based on an evaluation of many alternative proxies which track a bank's credit loss experience (CLE), the thesis proposes a preferred model for impaired assets expense (as % of loans) as dependent variable, mainly because of its timely nature and good data availability. Explanatory variables include aggregate macro variables of which changes in unemployment and the return in the share markets are found to have the most significant influence on a bank's credit losses. Bank-specific control variables include a pre-provision earnings proxy whose significance points to the use of provisions for the purpose of income smoothing by Australasian banks. The model also controls for size and nature of lending as smaller, retail-oriented housing lenders, on average, exhibit lower loan losses. Clear results are found with regard to the effect of rapid expansion which appears to be followed by a surge of bad debt provisions 2 to 3 years later. Moreover, inefficient banks tend to suffer greater credit losses. An important part of the thesis looks at the characteristics of alternative CLE proxies such as stock of provisions, impaired assets and write-offs which have been used by earlier literature. Estimating the preferred model with such alternative CLE parameters confirms their peculiarities such as the memory character of stock of provisions and the delayed nature of write-offs. These measures correlate rather poorly amongst themselves which calls for caution in the comparative interpretation of earlier studies that use differing CLE proxies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">credit risk</field><field name="subject">loan loss provisions</field><field name="subject">banking</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2649</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phylogeography and Ecology of New Zealand Freshwater Amphipoda (Paracalliope, Paraleptamphopus, and Phreatogammarus)</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Darin Lee</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT  This thesis examines phylogenetic patterns in three New Zealand amphipod taxa in relation to current geographic distributions and historical climatic (e.g. glaciation, marine inundation) and geological (e.g. mountain building) events using DNA sequencing and distributional data. It also examines how recognition behaviour can be used to delineate potential species boundaries and to assess the role of sexual selection. The endemic genus Phreatogammarus has been found in only a limited number of sites and is not very abundant. An analysis of the genetic variation of two species within the genus using allozyme electrophoresis revealed high levels of genetic differentiation among populations but low levels within populations. This suggested that limited dispersal occurred among habitats with one population possibly representing a cryptic species. The endemic freshwater genus Paraleptamphopus is thought to contain a large number of undescribed species with a number of these existing in small waterbodies such as seepages. Examination of the phylogeographic patterns using both mtDNA (CO1) and nuclear DNA (28S) showed that a number of distinct genetic lineages exist, with CO1 revealing 21 haplotypes with genetic distance of over 20%. Using a molecular clock rate of 2.4%, most haplotypes diverged approximately 8-12 million years ago during the Miocene era, possibly as a result of greater land availability increasing habitat diversity or by allopatric speciation. Morphological and genetic differences were not congruent, with morphologically similar taxa appearing among highly genetically distinct lineages, and some morphologically distinct forms appearing within single lineages. The distribution and habitat variables of 419 sites were analysed to determine what was affecting the presence or absence of Paraleptamphopus. The presence of native vegetation in catchments had a positive affect on Paraleptamphopus distribution suggesting that large anthropogenic changes in catchment vegetation could have a negative effect on their abundance. I found smaller waterbodies to be more important than larger ones highlighting the need to study such sites as rare taxa may be ignored. A better understanding is needed on the role of small waterbodies in promoting overall species diversity in catchments. Examination of Paracalliope fluviatilis phylogenetic patterns using the mtDNA gene CO1 showed that a number of separate clades existed suggesting long term isolation and limited dispersal among catchments. Due to the large genetic divergences among some populations there was the possibility that cryptic species might exist. Species recognition experiments were conducted on seven populations to help determine whether cryptic species were present. For the three most genetically divergent crosses there was bias against inter-population pairings, suggesting that there were between two or three separate species. Using a combined field and laboratory approach, size assortative mating was examined in Paracalliope fluviatilis. The field study showed positive size assortative mating and that larger females carried more eggs, suggesting they were more fecund. A series of laboratory experiments examining four existing theories explaining the phenomenon found that none adequately explained positive size assortative mating in P. fluviatilis. I therefore presented two new explanations to explain size assortative mating: a combination of female resistance and size-related variation in a male's capacity to amplex larger females or a form of indirect intra-sexual competition.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="subject">Evolution</field><field name="subject">Crustacea</field><field name="subject">Species diversity</field><field name="subject">Species recognition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Health and the Spiritual Self: Development and Application of a Theory and Measure of the Process of Healthy Change</field><field name="creator">Faull, Kieren</field><field name="description">The overall goal of the thesis was to investigate the nature of the healthy human self and the process of achieving health.  This was undertaken by reviewing established self-theory and presenting a summary of each theory and its position with regard to self-composition, self-agency and the nature of the healthy self.  An inclusive self-theory was then developed, congruent with reviewed literature, which positioned spirituality as the essential core of self.  From the foundational Spiritual Theory of Self and the findings of the first study in this thesis, the Health Change Process Theory was developed to explain and predict how people achieve sustainable health.  Three subsequent studies resulted in the construction and testing of a quantitative measure which enabled scientific investigation of the nature of the healthy self and the process of achieving health.  Method The methodology of the four studies in this thesis was based on the instrumental approach which posits that, while there are procedural differences between qualitative and quantitative methodologies, philosophically speaking, there is no fundamental difference as they are both equally applicable and valuable.  Consequently, the methodology judged to be the most appropriate instrument to investigate each study's topic of inquiry was chosen rather than allegiance to either qualitative or quantitative methodology.  The first study was qualitative, as it investigated the definition of health and the process by which it was achieved from the perspective of 30 people with chronic musculoskeletal impairments.  The findings from this study provided the theoretical basis for the three subsequent questionnaire development and validation studies.  The second study used qualitative methodology with 59 participants to identify participant-generated items used in a new quantitative holistic health questionnaire and then employed quantitative methods to perform preliminary tests of the reliability and validity of this measure.  The third study used quantitative methods with 233 participants to evaluate more robustly the reliability, content and concurrent validity of the original developmental measure and another, behaviourally-orientated assessment instrument, which used the identical item content but re-framed in the past tense.   The fourth study employed qualitative and quantitative methods with 205 participants to evaluate the clinical validity of the scale found to possess reliability and validity in the previous investigation.  Results The critical review of self-theory concluded with the development of the Spiritual Theory of Self.  The initial study supported this theory as a robust explanation and predictor of the determinants of a healthy self.  Furthermore, the findings of this study and a review of relevant literature concluded with the development of a Health Change Process Theory, which was based on the Spiritual Theory of Self.  The Health Change Process Theory explains and predicts the process by which a healthy self develops.  The subsequent questionnaire development and validation studies sought to provide a quantitative holistic assessment tool, congruent with the Health Change Process Theory, and found the 28-item QE Health Scale (QEHS) to be a reliable and valid measure of holistic health.  These results also demonstrated that the Health Change Process Theory and the underpinning Spiritual Theory of Self were robust.  With regard to clinical application, the QEHS was found to aid assessment, therapeutic intervention, a client-centred holistic approach to healthcare and evidenced-based practice.  The Patient Profile, derived from QEHS responses, provided a tool that enabled theory to be applied to practice by identifying the key indicator personal attributes determining holistic health status.  Conclusion The research results demonstrated that the Spiritual Theory of Self and the Health Change Process Theory provide valid explanations of the constructs that enable people with musculoskeletal disorders to remain otherwise healthy with such conditions.  Furthermore, the relationship between the findings and established self-theories suggest that the Spiritual Theory of Self and the Health Change Process Theory may advance knowledge of the predictors and interventions that enable all people to undertake a health-enhancing process of change when confronted with adversity.    The QEHS and associated Patient Profile were found to be reliable and valid tools that facilitated assessment and enhancement of the holistic health status for people with musculoskeletal impairments.  These tools identified barriers to achievement of holistic health, predicted by the Health Change Process Theory; facilitated the therapeutic process through a focus on issues meaningful to those receiving healthcare; aided treatment decision making; and enabled quantitative evidence-based evaluation of the efficacy of interventions.  Moreover, the overall results have advanced psychological knowledge with implications for all fields of psychology involved in the study of people.  The evidence of the research undertaken provides a basis for promoting knowledge and research of chronic healthcare delivery and a spiritually based conception of self and health.  The QEHS and associated theories provide a tool and basis for investigations where people are experiencing traumatic, irreversible crises.  However, the initial aims of further research should be to refine the QEHS and the associated Patient Profile to enable the use of theory and the QEHS across a diverse range of research populations and to investigate the applicability of these to facilitate the maintenance or achievement of a healthy self.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spirituality</field><field name="subject">holistic health measurement</field><field name="subject">the QE Health Scale</field><field name="subject">self-concepts</field><field name="subject">the Health Change Process theory</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative and Functional Analysis of Gene Expression in Ophiostoma Species</field><field name="creator">Robson, Lisa Marie</field><field name="description">Ophiostoma floccosum and Ophiostoma piliferum are polymorphic ascomycete fungi found throughout the world. Both species are important economically as they are known to colonise timber and cause discoloration of wood thus reducing its aesthetic value and subsequently price. Albino variants of the two species, in particular O. piliferum, are used as biological control agents to prevent sapstaining and have been used commercially for the past 15 years to reduce pitch/wood extractives in paper manufacturing. Other members of the genus include the plant pathogens O. novo-ulmi and O. clavigerum, known to have a severe effect on forest health and economy around the world. O. floccosum and O. piliferum have been demonstrated in the laboratory to be fermented in large volumes and they are particularly suitable as hosts capable of secreting extracellular recombinant proteins. This research aimed to investigate the transcriptome and molecular functioning of Ophiostoma floccosum and compare this to transcriptomic data available for Ophiostoma piliferum and other Ophiostoma species, O. novo-ulmi, O. clavigerum and O. piceae. This research contributes to the development of O. floccosum and O. piliferum as hosts for protein expression and advances the knowledge of gene expression and molecular functioning in this genus.  To gain insight into the molecular functioning of O. floccosum, an expressed sequence tag (EST) collection from yeast-like growth (blastospores) was created during early phase growth.  A total of 1207 EST sequences with an average length of 713 bp were identified. Clustering and assembly of the high-quality EST data set resulted in the identification of 598 unique putative transcripts (UPTs). Functional classification of these UPTs, using both homology searching and ab-initio methods, indicated that the majority of protein transcripts produced were involved in metabolism and cell proliferation. Up-regulation of mitochondrial transcripts involved in respiration and the presence of transcripts homologous to enzymes involved in the tri-carboxylic acid cycle indicated that aerobic respiration was likely the preferred method of ATP production in O. floccosum blastospores. However, the putative identification of genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenases within O. floccosum ESTs and the presence of homologues in other Ophiostoma species would suggest that these Ophiostoma species are also likely to be capable of metabolic functioning under anaerobic conditions.  To identify homologous genes between Ophiostoma species, the O. floccosum EST data set was compared to 20,783 ESTs from other Ophiostoma species including O. piliferum, O. novo-ulmi, O. clavigerum and O. piceae. All UPTs identified within each of the datasets were aligned resulting in the identification of 347 clusters containing EST sequences from more than one Ophiostoma species. Six were identified that had homologues in all of the datasets excluding O. piceae. Three of the six homologous UPTs were predicted to function in core metabolism with two of the UPTs identified as encoding enzymes used in the glycolysis pathway and one encoding a 60S ribosomal protein. The other three homologous UPTs were thought to have a functional role in protein fate and were putatively identified as being a superoxide dismutase, heat-shock protein and a structural alpha-B chain tubulin gene. Of the 347 clusters, 86 of these contained transcripts identified in the O. floccosum EST datasets, and of these 86, only 10 fragments did not align with any significant homology to other fungal sequences contained in the NCBI non redundant database, indicating that the majority these transcripts are conserved in other fungal species.  Predicted genes within the Ophiostoma EST datasets were also investigated to determine codon usage and to identify the presence of genes predicted to encode proteases. Both are important factors in recombinant protein expression. Protease production can severely inhibit the production of recombinant protein in fungal hosts. Based on sequence homology to known proteases, putative proteases were identified in all of the Ophiostoma species investigated with the exception of O. piceae. Homologues for all six peptidase groups were identified including a possible glutamic acid protease and proportionally high numbers of serine and metallo-protease homologues. This research constitutes the first reported findings of putative peptidases in the aspartic, cysteine, glutamic and threonine peptidase families in Ophiostoma species. Key to the over-expression of recombinant proteins is the optimisation of codons in a cloned gene to better utilise available tRNA species within the recombinant host. No codon bias was apparent between up-regulated and lower frequency transcripts in O. floccosum, O. piliferum, O. clavigerum and O. novo-ulmi. Codon usage was found to be consistent between these Ophiostoma species. However, a large difference between the codon usage in mitochondrially encoded genes compared to nuclear encoded genes in O. floccosum was indicated. To optimise the efficiency of a recombinant expression system, we sought to identify promoters in both O. floccosum and O. piliferum that may be applied to a vector system. Using EST data, the most up-regulated UPTs identified from O. floccosum and O. piliferum ESTs were a putative subunit 4 of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase protein (NADH-UR4) and a possible heat-shock protein (HSP), respectively. A unique hydrolase gene was also identified by molecular probing of O. floccosum genomic DNA. This putative 96 kd protein, called PLIP-Lg, was predicted to be a mitochondrial A1 phospholipase based on both nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence structure and homology. These gene sequences were investigated using genome walking methods to further elucidate nucleotide sequences in the 5' and 3' directions. In silico investigation of the 5' promoter region of the genes identified a number of predicted transcription factor binding sites, including possible TATA boxes identified previously in the promoter region of an O. floccosum protein. Additionally, RT-PCR methods were used to compare the expression of these transcripts throughout growth in both the mycelial and blastospore forms. All three predicted genes were found to be transcribed throughout growth in both morphological forms and, thus, the use of their promoters in a vector system would not be limited to one morphology. However, the level of expression in blastospores compared to mycelial growth varied by up to 20 fold.  Therefore, the morphological form of the fungi did influence the level of expression of these genes and is a factor for consideration for future promoter use.  This PhD thesis research provides the first comprehensive investigation into gene expression and the transcriptome of O. floccosum while also providing the first comparative look into similarities between the transcriptomes of several Ophiostoma species. Subsequently, this research adds to the knowledge of metabolic functioning in Ophiostoma species and illustrates the usefulness of EST analysis in determining core molecular functioning within this group. Further to addressing these goals, the research will augment future research into various biotechnological applications for the genus, specifically the development of O. floccosum and O. piliferum as hosts for recombinant protein expression.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ophiostoma</field><field name="subject">EST</field><field name="subject">transcriptome</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Acoustic Ecology of the First-Person Shooter</field><field name="creator">Grimshaw, Mark Nicholas</field><field name="description">This thesis contributes to the field of Game Studies by presenting the hypothesis that the player(s) and soundscape(s) in the first-person shooter (FPS) game, and the relationships between them, may be construed as an acoustic ecology.  It explores the idea that the single-player FPS game acoustic ecology has the basic components of player and soundscape and that the relationships between these two lead to the creation and perception of a variety of spaces within the game world constituting a significant contributing factor to player immersion in that world.  Additionally, in a multiplayer FPS game, these individual acoustic ecologies form part of a larger acoustic ecology which may be explained through autopoietic principles.  There has been little written on digital game sound (much less on FPS game sound) and so the research contained within this thesis is an important contribution to the Game Studies field.  Furthermore, the elaboration of the hypothesis provides insight into the role of sound in the perception of a variety of spaces in the FPS game, and player immersion in those spaces, and this has significance not only for Game Studies but also for other disciplines such as virtual environment design and the study of real-world acoustic ecologies.  A text-based methodology is employed in which literature from a range of disciplines is researched for concepts relevant to the hypothesis but, where necessary, new concepts will be devised.  The aim of the methodology is to construct a conceptual framework which is used to explicate the hypothesis and which may, with future refinement, be used for the study of sound in digital game genres other than FPS.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acoustic ecology</field><field name="subject">audio</field><field name="subject">autopoiesis</field><field name="subject">digital game</field><field name="subject">first-person shooter</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preformulation and Formulation of Steroids and Assessment of an Electronically Modulated Intravaginal Device for Induced Calving or Oestrous synchronization of Cattle.</field><field name="creator">Ismail, Ali Abdi</field><field name="description">Drug delivery technology is currently advancing faster than at any time in biotechnology history. The challenge of drug delivery is to achieve a controlled release of therapeutic agents over an extended period. Controlled release potentially offers significant advantages over conventional dosage forms, by eliminating both under- and overdosing while maintaining a desired range of drug concentrations. An existing drug regimen for induced calving produces a declining blood profile that does not mimic the naturally occurring, gradually increasing, cortisol blood level around parturition effectively, causing animal health issues.  Likewise, while the existing progesterone controlled release systems for oestrous control successfully synchronise oestrus, it is however, associated with reduced fertility and as such other drugs have to be administered to improve the fertility during oestrus. Therefore, there is a need for a drug delivery system that is capable of delivering multiple drugs at various times and patterns. This research aimed to investigate, characterize, identify steroids with high absorption rates through vaginal mucosa and evaluate the potential of an electronic drug delivery system for the delivery of steroids for either the control of the bovine oestrous cycle or induced calving. In order to identify steroids with high absorption rates across the vaginal mucosa, an in vitro permeation method was developed to screen selected steroids for their ability to permeate artificial and biological membranes. The steroids were pre-formulated to enhance their solubility and permeation through these membranes. Analytical UV and HPLC assays to characterise the pure and formulated steroidal compounds were also developed and validated. An assessment of an intravaginal Electronically Modulated Intravaginal Device (EMID) for the control of the bovine oestrous cycle or induced calving was carried out. Five different release assessment methods were investigated and critically evaluated in order to identify the most appropriate release assessment method for the EMID. These were: 1) the Drug Dissolution Test, 2) a weight loss method, 3) the dispensed weight method, 4) the determination of piston travel distance method, and 5) the rod expulsion from the EMID method. The methods investigated were critically evaluated in terms of ease of use and automation, reproducibility and cost/time savings. Optimisation of various components and construction materials of the EMID were also investigated. Animal trials were carried out using the original EMID (manufactured from polypropylene polymer) and modified inserts (manufactured from high density polyethylene polymer) to determine their retention rate in the animals. Accelerated stability testing of progesterone in suspension, oestradiol-17 tablets, cloprostenol as a powder blend and the driving mechanism of the EMID were examined. The flux of the steroids was evaluated through poly-&amp;-caprolactone and excised cow mucosa membranes using side-by-side permeation cells. Results indicated that progesterone followed by dexamethasone acetate and dexamethasone valerate showed higher permeability values through vaginal mucosa compared to dexamethasone or its other analogues. The weight loss method of the EMID proved to be an easy and appropriate method to measure the release rate from the EMID. A high density polyethylene polymer was identified as the most ideal body material for the insert compared to polypropylene body. Also double O-ring silicone, Elastollan WYO 1388-5 and solid silicone pistons were found to be amongst the best pistons tested and all performed well compared to other piston materials. There was a low retention rate with either the original EMID or the modified inserts. Further modification of retention wings of the EMID did not improve the retention rate, but a good blood profile response was obtained from cows treated with the complete EMID containing formulated progesterone. The formulations and driving mechanism were found to be stable under the tested conditions.  Therefore, the EMID has potential for commercial application of induced calving or oestrous control per vaginum administration, reliant on improvement of its retention mechanism.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">steroids</field><field name="subject">dexamethasone</field><field name="subject">steroids permeation across biological and non-biological membranes</field><field name="subject">formulation</field><field name="subject">HPLC analytical methods</field><field name="subject">electronically modulated intravaginal device</field><field name="subject">induced calving and oestrous synchronisation..</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The factors responsible for the varying levels of UMF&#174; in m&#257;nuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey</field><field name="creator">Stephens, Jonathan McDonald Counsell</field><field name="description">The variability in the level of the non-peroxide antibacterial component (UMF&#174;) of m&#257;nuka honey produced in New Zealand was studied. A field analysis confirmed considerable variability existed in the honeys, and a number of hypotheses to explain this variability were proposed and examined.  Nectar derived from Leptospermum scoparium (m&#257;nuka), was confirmed to be the source of UMF&#174;.  The dilution of m&#257;nuka honey with nectar derived from other floral sources was found to proportionally reduce the UMF&#174; in monofloral m&#257;nuka honey. The utilisation of the thixotropic properties of m&#257;nuka honey allowed the degree of dilution in the field samples to be established, and an adjustment of the field results to account for the dilution of UMF&#174; by other honey types revealed all monofloral m&#257;nuka honey contains UMF&#174;. However, in the monofloral m&#257;nuka honey, significantly different levels of UMF&#174; activity were found to come from reasonably well-defined geographic regions.  The cause of the variable levels of UMF&#174; activity in m&#257;nuka honey would appear to be the different varieties of L. scoparium being harvested by the honeybees, and the environmental parameters influencing nectar production or another species interacting with L. scoparium do not appear to influence UMF&#174; activity.  Three methods were used to establish genetic variability within regions of the North Island of New Zealand that gave rise to the various levels of UMF&#174; activity. Analyses of morphological characteristics, chemotaxonomic essential oil profiles, and population genetics of L. scoparium populations were conducted, and the conclusions that were drawn from each of these were very similar. Two major divisions were identified, each divided into two varieties. The northern division, which contained the core populations from Northland and Waikato, represented the previously described L. scoparium var. incanum and L. scoparium var. linifolium. This division yielded m&#257;nuka honey with high UMF&#174; activity. The southern division, which contained the core populations from the Central North Island and East Coast, represented the previously described L. scoparium var. myrtifolium and an unnamed variety. The latter, growing principally on the East Coast, uniquely contains triketones essential oils. The southern division yielded m&#257;nuka honey with low UMF&#174; activity. Hybridisation between these varieties will occur, leading to a continuum of UMF&#174; activity in m&#257;nuka honey.  The data indicated multiple dispersions of L. scoparium to New Zealand from the evolutionary centre of the persistent-capsule Leptospermum group in south-east Australia, and later regional dispersal in New Zealand.  From this study two hypotheses were accepted: the variability in the UMF&#174; activity of m&#257;nuka honey is due to both the dilution of m&#257;nuka honey by other honey types and the variety of L. scoparium harvested.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Leptospermum scoparium</field><field name="subject">manuka</field><field name="subject">honey</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Introducing a new subject: The case of environmental education in Taiwanese junior high schools</field><field name="creator">Yueh, Mei-Chun (Michelle)</field><field name="description">The introduction of environmental education in schools has been the focus of a long campaign worldwide since the late 1960s.  The difficulties in teaching environmental education, including the choice of curriculum models, and the obstacles to changing contemporary schooling patterns have been well documented.  The traditional process of new subject emergence has been detailed in the literature; whether or not environmental education should or could follow this traditional pattern of subject emergence in schools is the focus of this thesis.  In Taiwan, the introduction of environmental education in junior high schools occurred as part of a nationwide curriculum change in 2002.  This research used an interpretive approach to explore the views and practices of staff in three typical Taiwanese junior high schools at this time.  The focus of the research was to study what happened at the level of classroom teaching and school development.  The research program was designed to interview both administrators and teachers before, during and after the first year (2002 school year) of curriculum implementation in each of the three case study schools.  Three rounds of interviews were conducted over a period of three years (Sept. 2001 - June 2004).  As well as interviews, national and school documents were collected; and announcements and decisions from the Ministry of Education and schools were documented.  Also, because the reform encouraged the development of school-based curriculum, a questionnaire was given to the one school which chose environmental education as their school-based curriculum in order to better understand the emergence of environmental education in this school.  The findings show a paradox in Taiwanese junior high schooling: although each school placed considerable value on environmental education, the data showed that the introduction of environmental education via an infusion strategy during a time of national curriculum change had minimal impact in the three Taiwanese case study schools.  A cross-case analysis indicated the reason for this failure was the lack of effectiveness of eleven supporting themes often discussed in the emergence of a new subject: the possibility of gaining external examination credit and entry to a university department; the prioritising of the subject in school timetabling and programming; the development of a systematic syllabus; the presence of proactive support from central government leadership; the provision of teacher professional development; the inclusion in the informal as well as the formal curriculum in a school; the inclusion of environmental education in non-formal education in society; the presence of clear subject characteristics and definition; the presence of substantial school-based material interests; the gaining of support from an external constituency, especially parents; and the presence of an emergence process that couples internal value evolution with external compulsion.  The Taiwanese case studies raised three particular and additional themes for the emergence of environmental education, specifically: the need to set up long-term partnerships with local groups that have an interest in or responsibility for the local environment (e.g. societies, agencies and non-governmental organisations) to achieve local environment involvement; the need for a whole school approach through curriculum integration to achieve the transformative nature of environmental education; and the need to build up a sound cooperative network that includes people at all levels of the education system and society to achieve a national cooperation network.  These three particular themes derived from the nature of environmental education as a holistic, integrative and interdisciplinary subject.  In summary, the findings not only confirmed the themes important for the emergence of environmental education and other contemporary school subjects, but they also raised particular themes pertinent to the emergence of environmental education.  When these three particular themes are not taken into account, the effective emergence of environmental education in contemporary schooling, as exemplified by Taiwanese junior high schools, will be difficult to achieve in mainstream education.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental education</field><field name="subject">infusion strategy</field><field name="subject">curriculum change</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="subject">junior high schools</field><field name="subject">school development</field><field name="subject">school-based curriculum</field><field name="subject">school subjects</field><field name="subject">subject emergence</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modified Output in Response to Clarification Requests and Second Language</field><field name="creator">Ogino, Masayoshi</field><field name="description">Modified output, second language (L2) learners' reformulation of their own utterances, has been attracting researchers' interest as an important component of learner interactions, and as a manifestation of interlanguage development and psycholinguistic processing. The output hypothesis (Swain, 1985, 1993, 1995, 2005) claims that the act of production constitutes part of the process of L2 learning in terms of noticing, hypothesis testing and metalinguistic functions.  This hypothesis has been used as a theoretical framework to investigate the relationship between modified output and L2 learning (e.g., McDonough, 2001, 2005; Nobuyoshi  Ellis, 1993; O'Relly, Flatiz,  Kromrey, 2001; Takashima  Ellis, 1999).  However, the empirical evidence from these studies does not yet appear to confirm unequivocally that the production of modified output facilitates L2 learning. The present study further explored the impact of modified output on L2 learning, by means of an experimental pre-test, post-test and delayed-post design.  The production of modified output was triggered by one type of implicit feedback, clarification requests.  The data were collected from 28 undergraduate students who were learning Japanese as a foreign language.  The target linguistic feature was the negation of adjectives in Japanese, and a total of 1,011 negations were elicited and analysed.  The impact of modified output on L2 learning was measured in two different aspects of potential outcomes of modified output (i.e., grammatical accuracy and interlanguage development).  In addition, the study investigated whether the non-targetlike forms which participants previously modified were then produced in the subsequent situations of use.  The output hypothesis was originally framed in terms of the relationship between output and grammatical accuracy, but the findings of the current study suggest that production of modified output in response to clarification requests may facilitate the progress of interlanguage development towards targetlike use even when its immediate impact on grammatical accuracy may not be observed.  Therefore, the present study lends at least partial support to the claim of the output hypothesis.  The results did not clearly demonstrate whether or not production of modified output might sensitise learners to avoid the use of the same non-targetlike form that they have previously modified.  This indicates a possibility of the limited role of production of modified output in L2 learning, and suggests that the follow-up feedback to learners' modified output may be necessary to maximise the impact of modified output in facilitating L2 learning.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">modified output</field><field name="subject">clarification requests</field><field name="subject">the output hypothesis</field><field name="subject">Japanese as a second language</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2657</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being and Becoming Reflexive in Teacher Education</field><field name="creator">Norsworthy, Beverley Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Initial teacher education is constantly in the spotlight regarding its quality and its effectiveness.  The literature contains many claims from those who believe that it is ineffectual.  The notion of the reflective practitioner was introduced and embraced as an antidote to these claims, and as an approach to break the influence of technocratic beliefs and expectations which pre-service teachers bring with them to their initial teacher education.  Typically reflection targets the practicum experience.  However, this study focuses specifically on the contribution of course work to the development of a reflective beginning teacher.  This qualitative study invited pre-service teachers to provide insight into their initial teacher education experience: initially within a Teaching of Science methods paper, and then some 18 months later at the conclusion of their three year Bachelor of Education (Teaching) professional preparation.  A critical reflexive interpretive methodology which sought authenticity within its meaning-making process developed from an initial consideration of self-study research methodology.  Of particular importance was that the enquiry was authentic, participants' voices were valued and recognition was given to the implications embedded within the context within which the study occurred.  Methods of data collection included in phase one were: a pre-course questionnaire, a Gestalt-like activity, and pre-service teachers' email reflections based on Hoban's (2000a) categories of learning influences, and meta-reflections from the Teaching of Science paper.  The journal I kept during this phase was also drawn upon as data.  Phase two data collection included a vignette, and a three part final questionnaire to which 40 pre-service teachers and nine teacher educators responded.  The findings suggest that pre-service teachers' understanding of the nature of education is critical to the way in which they experience the course work within initial teacher education.  This understanding shapes their perception and consideration lens through which course work is experienced.  On entrance to initial teacher education this lens is described, for many pre-service teachers, as technocratic.  Education is seen as a commodity, something to acquire, teaching is telling and initial teacher education is dependent on the teacher educator providing the necessary tools and techniques so the beginning teacher can do the right thing.  This study suggests that such a stance toward educational experiences is a hindrance mechanism when teacher educators seek transformative teaching, learning, and reflexivity.  However, when that view of education is as a process of growth and transformation toward a valued 'way of being', the perspective and consideration lens is described as professional.  Rather than focusing on what a teacher does, the focus is on whom the teacher is and how this influences the teaching and learning process.  Teacher educators and the institution which is the context within which course work occurs also demonstrate a mixture of technocratic and professional lenses.  Important factors within initial teacher education which contribute to transformation from technocratic to professional lens include relational and pedagogical connectedness.  These factors lead to valuing, ownership and justification of learning where assessment tasks are tools for personal development and where critical consideration of multiple perspectives has an important role.  Relational connectedness (to self, peers, and teacher educators) is important for developing a safe, but challenging, dialogical space in which paradoxes, challenges and pre-service teachers' vulnerable sense of disorientation may be engaged.  Pedagogical connectedness relates to the fit between what the teacher educator says and does.  For example, a powerful approach to learning is where the pre-service teachers learn to be reflexive, by being reflexive.  The study indicates the importance of institutional congruency so that what is espoused is experienced through language, assessment, teaching approaches and contextual culture.  However, pre-service teachers' perception and consideration lens determines the degree to which course work is transformational.  Where a technocratic lens is dominant, reflection becomes a task to be completed.  Where a professional lens is dominant, reflection becomes an iterative process for improving practice by becoming professionally self aware through identifying assumptions in decisions and responses within the learning/teaching relationship, and judging those assumptions for their appropriateness in the light of a developing and critiqued personally owned educational vision.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teacher education</field><field name="subject">reflection</field><field name="subject">reflective practice</field><field name="subject">pre-service teacher</field><field name="subject">pedagogical connectedness</field><field name="subject">relational connectedness</field><field name="subject">reflexive connectedness</field><field name="subject">conceptual framework</field><field name="subject">teacher educator</field><field name="subject">transformative assessment practices</field><field name="subject">professional</field><field name="subject">critical reflexive interpretive methodology</field><field name="subject">practitioner-led research</field><field name="subject">vignette</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geodesic Geometry of Black Holes</field><field name="creator">Slezakova, Gabriela</field><field name="description">The study of geodesics is of intrinsic significance in the study of the geometry of space-time. In this thesis null, space-like and time-like geodesics are studied in the case of the space-times of Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrouml;m and Kerr black holes. These space-times have been investigated with varying degrees of thoroughness in many articles and some books. However, there are some significant gaps in these treatments and the central aim of this thesis is to fill these gaps where necessary. Moreover, the following topics are covered for the first time. 1. In Chapter 4 a thorough treatment of the space-like geodesics of the Schwarzschild solutions has been given. These geodesics are the trajectories of Tachyons (faster than light particles) and are treated in a complete manner. This has been done by obtaining exact solutions and solving them numerically. 2. In Part II all solutions for geodesics for a Reissner-Nordstrouml;m black hole have been given in complete detail, i.e. time-like, null and space-like geodesics and orbit of a charged particle. 3. In Chapter 14 all solutions for geodesics in the equatorial plane of a Kerr black hole have been given in complete detail, i.e. time-like, null and space-like geodesics. 4. The study of special types of non-equatorial geodesics for a Kerr black hole have been given in complete detail, i.e. time-like (Chapter 17), null (Chapter 15) and space-like (Chapter 16). This has been done in order to distinguish the qualitatively different types of solutions.  Calculation of the explicit formulas, which describe these geodesics, as well as numerically computed diagrams representing the geodesics have been incorporated in these studies. The following subjects have been also treated: 5.  Solutions for the geodesics in Reissner-Nordstrouml;m black holes with |Q_*| gt;= M, which are black holes with one (|Q_*| = M) or no horizon (|Q_*|gt; M) (Chapter 8). 6. Solutions of geodesics in extreme and fast Kerr black holes, i.e. black holes with a = M (extreme) and a gt; M (fast). As in the case of |Q_*| gt; M, fast black holes have naked singularities (Chapter 14). 7. Some general observations about orbit types of the Kerr black holes regarding relationships between parameters such as angular momentum, energy, Carter constant and mass and angular momentum of black holes (Chapter 13). 8. Some corrections to errors found in the literature.  While it has not been possible to cover all different cases which occur for possible relations amongst the parameters specifying a general black hole, interesting geodesics have, however, been studied and a more thorough  presentation of the properties of geodesics has now been given.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geodesic</field><field name="subject">black hole</field><field name="subject">geometry</field><field name="subject">Schwarzschild</field><field name="subject">Kerr</field><field name="subject">Reissner-Nordstrom</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Context and change in management accounting and control systems: A case study of Telecom Fiji Limited</field><field name="creator">Sharma, Umesh Prasad</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to contribute to research in management accounting and control systems (MACS) in a developing country context: that of Fiji.  It seeks to gain a theoretical understanding of how MACS reflect the social and political contexts in which they operate by using a case study of Telecom Fiji Limited (a major supplier of telephone communications in Fiji).  The definition of  MACS  for the purpose of the thesis is broad- a social constructivist perspective is adopted in which systems are used to align employee behaviour with organisational objectives and to assist external relationships (with the State, Commerce Commission, aid agencies and customers).  The thesis draws on institutional theory while raising questions as to how to refine and extend institutional theory.  This theory has often been associated with institutional embeddedness (stability).  The social constructivist approach helps to incorporate agency and cultural issues normally missing in conventional applications of institutional theory to accounting change.  Telecom Fiji Limited (TFL) was restructured under the Fiji government's public sector reforms.  Such reforms were insisted upon by the international financial agencies of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund.  Under the reform policy, TFL was transformed from a government department into a corporatised organisation and was subsequently privatised.  The MACS changes which eventuated helped to change TFL management and employees' interpretive schemes. However, employees resisted initial changes to commercial business routines and it took some years for TFL actors to assimilate commercial practices.  While the literature dealing with MACS changes has mostly portrayed changes as occurring with little resistance, MACS changes at TFL took several years to become institutionalised, partly because of cultural and political factors specific to Fiji.  The study has practice implications as it shows that management accountants can act as institutional entrepreneurs in organisations, shaping new accounting technologies in reformed entities, and changing actors' interpretive schemes.  The study has implications for policy makers, consultants and other stakeholders in terms of promoting a need for better understanding of the sensitivity to cultural and political circumstances in Less Developed Countries (LDC's) like Fiji in relation to the introduction of MACS changes.  The study has implications for other recently corporatized/ privatised and state-sector organisations in Fiji and elsewhere.  It also has implications for other researchers as institutional theory can be refined on the basis of new empirical evidence.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">management accounting</field><field name="subject">control systems</field><field name="subject">institutional theory</field><field name="subject">institutional entrepreneurs</field><field name="subject">Fiji.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2660</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Psychological Contract: The Development and Validation of a Managerial Measure</field><field name="creator">Cable, Donald Alfred James</field><field name="description">The research objective was to develop, through two phases involving development and validation, a measure of the psychological work contract for managerial level employees.  The psychological contract is the unwritten implicit contract that forms in the minds of employees and contains the obligations and expectations that they believe exists between themselves and the organization.  In the first and qualitative phase of the study, a structured interview procedure resulted in the collection of 651 responses from a convenience sample of 35 managers from seven New Zealand organizations.  Responses related to what these managers believed they were obligated to provide the organization (perceived organizational expectations), and what they believed the organization was obligated to provide them (their expectations).  Content analysis of these 651 statements resulted in the development of two initial measures of the psychological contract (employee obligations, organization obligations).  The employee obligations measure (perceived organizational expectations of the employee) contained 16 items, and the organization obligations measure (employee expectations of the organization) contained 23 items.  In the second and quantitative phase of the study, and using the same criteria for participation as for phase one, a convenience sample of 124 managers from 13 New Zealand organizations completed questionnaires.  The questionnaires included the measures of psychological contract content developed in phase one of the study, and 8 organizational psychology variables to be included in a nomological network.  The nomological network included intention to quit, perceived organizational support, work and job involvement, job satisfaction, career plateau, organizational commitment, person-organization fit, and 2 performance measures.  A separate questionnaire covering job performance and organizational citizenship behaviour was completed by 94 of the participants' managers.  Of the 54 relationships predicted in the nomological network, 41 were significant.  Of the 13 non-significant relationships, 10 involved relationships with the two performance measures.   The measures of the psychological contract were subjected to a construct validation process involving two steps.  The first step involved item and factor analysis.  Factor analysis of the two measures of the psychological contract revealed two factors in each.  One factor, termed relational obligations and reflecting a collective interest between the employee and the organization, included the items that were believed to influence more directly the relationship between managers and the organization.  This factor included items such as  be committed to the job  (an employee obligation) and  provide a physically and socially safe environment  (an organizational obligation).  The other factor, termed transactional obligations and reflecting a self/other interest on the part of the employee, included the items that were believed to be of a more direct employment transactions nature.  This factor included items such as  stay true to your own values and beliefs  (an employee obligation) and  provide professional and personal support  (an organizational obligation). In the second step of the validation process, the measures of the psychological contract were embedded into the nomological network and their relationships with the ten variables in that network were tested.  Of the ten hypothesised relationships, only one emerged as significant, that being the relationship between the organization obligations component of the psychological contract and person-organization fit.  Minimal support for construct validity of the measures of the psychological contract was provided confirming that further effort will be required before complete construct validity may be claimed for the measured.  Although the contribution the research makes to the field of knowledge may be limited, it does provide some validation of existing measures of the psychological contract, developed in other studies using different samples.  The present findings increase our knowledge of the content of the psychological contract for managers.  Additionally, a methodological framework has been established for continuing research into the content of psychological contracts, including an exploration of the relationship between content and fulfilment, along with a structure for comparing the psychological contract of disparate occupational groups.  The most likely explanation for the hypotheses not being fully supported is that it is fulfilment (or conversely breach or violation) of the psychological contract, rather than the content of the contract per se, that is related to the variables in the nomological network.  Whilst the hypotheses were based on research that considered fulfilment of the contract, this study focussed on the content of psychological contracts.  The reasons for basing the hypotheses on research that considered fulfilment, the influence of this decision on hypothesis testing, and other possible explanations for the hypotheses not finding greater support, are explored.  The limitations of the study, and possible directions for future research, are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psychological contract</field><field name="subject">construct validation</field><field name="subject">nomological network</field><field name="subject">job performance</field><field name="subject">organizational citizenship behavior</field><field name="subject">intention to quit</field><field name="subject">perceived organizational support</field><field name="subject">work and job involvement</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">career plateau</field><field name="subject">organizational commitment</field><field name="subject">person-organization fit</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2661</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processing mathematical thinking through digital pedagogical media: the spreadsheet</field><field name="creator">Calder, Nigel Stuart</field><field name="description">Abstract  This study is concerned with the ways mathematical understanding emerges when mathematical phenomena are encountered through digital pedagogical media, the spreadsheet, in particular. Central to this, was an examination of the affordances digital technologies offer, and how the affordances associated with investigating mathematical tasks in the spreadsheet environment, shaped the learning trajectories of the participants. Two categories of participating students were involved, ten-year-old primary school pupils, and pre-service teachers. An eclectic approach to data collection, including qualitative and quantitative methods, was initially undertaken, but as my research perspective evolved, a moderate hermeneutic frame emerged as the most productive way in which to examine the research questions. A hermeneutic process transformed the research methodology, as well as the manner in which the data were interpreted. The initial analysis and evolving methodology not only informed this transition to a moderate hermeneutic lens, they were constitutive of the ongoing research perspectives and their associated interpretations. The data, and some that was subsequently collected, were then reconsidered from this modified position.  The findings indicated that engaging mathematical tasks through the pedagogical medium of the spreadsheet, influenced the nature of the investigative process in particular ways. As a consequence, the interpretations of the interactions, and the understandings this evoked, also differed. The students created and made connections between alternative models of the situations, while the visual, tabular structuring of the environment, in conjunction with its propensity to instantly manage large amounts of output accurately, facilitated their observation of patterns. They frequently investigated the visual nature of these patterns, and used visual referents in their interpretations and explanations. It also allowed them to pose and test their informal conjectures and generalisations in non-threatening circumstances, to reset investigative sub-goals easily, hence fostering risk taking in their approach. At times, the learning trajectory evolved in unexpected ways, and the data illustrated various alternative ways in which unexpected, visual output stimulated discussion and extended the boundaries of, or reorganised, their interaction and mathematical thinking. An examination of the visual perturbations, and other elements of learning as hermeneutic processes also revealed alternative understandings and explanations.  Viewing the data and the research process through hermeneutic filters enhanced the connectivity between the emergence of individual mathematical understanding, and the cultural formation of mathematics. It permitted consideration of the ways this process influences the evolution of mathematics education research. While interpretive approaches are inevitably imbued with the researcher perspective in the analysis of what gets noticed, the research gave fresh insights into the ways learning emerges through digital pedagogical media, and the potential of this engagement to change the nature of mathematics education.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematics education</field><field name="subject">ICT</field><field name="subject">problem solving</field><field name="subject">primary</field><field name="subject">spreadsheets</field><field name="subject">mathematical thinking</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wage Structures and Employment Outcomes in New Zealand, and Their Relationship to Technological Change</field><field name="creator">Hector, Christopher James</field><field name="description">After 100 years at an historically low level, inequality began to rise in the late 20th century, a trend which was especially marked in the English-speaking countries including New Zealand. Various explanations have been advanced, but internationally the most favoured theory is skill-biased technological change, driven by the new information and communication technologies. This thesis used income and wage data from the New Zealand Population Census and the New Zealand Income Survey to examine wage trends between 1991 and 2004. As in other developed countries wage dispersion was increasing in the 1990s, though it appears to have slowed since 2001, and the increased inequality is strongly correlated with workers' skills and qualifications. There is also a correlation between new technology and earnings inequality, but this appears to be attributable to the demand for skills in the industries which are changing fastest, rather than anything intrinsic to the new technology.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Inequality-New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Technological change-New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2663</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Axial Variations and Entry Effects in a Pressure Screen</field><field name="creator">Atkins, Martin John</field><field name="description">Pressure screens are used for contaminant removal and fibre length fractionation in the production of pulp and paper products.  Axial variations and entry effects in the screen are known to occur and these variations have not been adequately quantified.  This thesis describes a fundamental study of the axial variations of several factors that occur within an industrial pressure screen; namely, pulp consistency, fibre length distribution, rotor pressure pulse, and feed annulus tangential velocity.  Axial variations of pulp consistency in the screen annulus and the accept chamber of the screen were studied using an internal radial sampling method.  Localised pulp samples were taken and evaluated and common measures of screen performance such as fibre passage ratio and fractionation efficiency were calculated along the screen.  Consistency generally increased along the length of the screen although under certain conditions the consistency toward the front of the screen was lower than the feed consistency.  A two passage ratio model that incorporated forward and reverse passage ratio was derived to elucidate the flow of both fibre and fluid through the screen and their effects on overall screen performance.  The passage of fibre through the screen decreased with screen length which generally had a positive effect on the fractionation efficiency toward the back of the screen.  The passage of individual fibre length fractions was also studied and it was found that long fibre had a much lower passage than short fibre which caused the average fibre length in the annulus to increase.  Rotor induced pressure pulse variations along the screen length were also investigated.  The magnitude of the pressure pulse was significantly lower (up to 40 %) at the rear of the screen.  The variation in pressure caused by the rotor is due to a Venturi effect and the shape of the rotor.  The relative velocity of the fluid and the rotor, called the slip factor, also directly affects the size of the pressure pulse in the annulus.  The slip factor decreases along the length of the screen due to the increase in tangential velocity of the fluid.  Pressure pulse data was also used to estimate the instantaneous aperture velocity and back-flush ratio.  The instantaneous aperture velocity was calculated to vary considerably from the superficial aperture velocity by up to 5 m/s in the forward direction and 10 m/s in the reverse direction.   Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used to model tangential velocity changes in simplified screen annuli with axial through flow.  For a smooth screen rotor the mean tangential velocity increased over the entire length of the annulus without reaching a maximum value.  A step and bump rotor were modelled and the shape of the pressure pulses showed good agreement with experimentally measured pulses.  The mean tangential velocity and the entrance length were found to be heavily dependant on the screen rotor used.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pressure Screening</field><field name="subject">Pulp Screening</field><field name="subject">CFD</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2664</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Chemical Investigation of New Zealand Unifloral Honeys</field><field name="creator">Senanayake, Mahima</field><field name="description">The diethyl ether-extracted organic compounds of 155 samples of unifloral grade New Zealand kamahi and honeydew honeys, and New Zealand and Norwegian erica honeys, together with a series of active and inactive manuka honeys were analysed using combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. It was found that Kamahi honey is characterized by the presence of 2,6-dimethylocta-3,7-diene-2,6-diol, meliracemoic acid, and kamahines A-C and these compounds were typically present at average levels of 31, 14, and 73 mg/kg of honey, respectively. 2,6-Dimethylocta-3,7-diene-2,6-diol was isolated and the structure of this compound was defined using one- and two-dimensional NMR analyses.  The only recognizably distinct peak present in the honeydew honey profile was indole acetic acid. In this honey, a relatively low to moderate level of indole acetic acid, ranging from 0.9 to 9.1 mg/kg honey was detected.  In the New Zealand erica honey samples, ericinic acid, isoericinic acid isomers (average levels 363 and 34 mg/kg respectively), trans,cis and trans,trans-abscisic acid isomers (average levels 302 and 224 mg/kg respectively) and benzoic acid (average level 6950 mg/kg) were identified as floral marker compounds. Ericinic acid was isolated and the structure of this acid was defined using one-and two-dimensional NMR analyses.  Low levels of ericinic and isoericinic acids (average levels of 1.1 and 0.32 mg/kg respectively) were detected in the Norwegian erica-rich honeys. The results presented here indicate that ericinic and isoericinic acids are likely to be universally present in erica honeys at levels which may range from as low as 1 mg/kg or less, as found in some Norwegian samples, to more than 100 mg/kg in some New Zealand samples.  Two groups, namely a fingerprint pattern which characterized active manuka honeys, and a fingerprint pattern that characterized inactive manuka honeys were identified. Some substances contributing to the GCMS profile were found as marker compounds for the presence of unidentified substances responsible for the UMF activity. A statistically significant correlation was found between a small set of marker compounds (i.e. phenylacetic acid, 2-methoxyacetophenone, 2-methoxybenzoic, phenyllactic, octanedioic, cis-cinnamic, trans-cinnamic, nonanedioic, 4-methoxyphenyllactic and decanedioic acids and methyl syringate) and UMF activity of manuka honey. The best-fit marker compound regression equation (R = 0.92) was obtained for a set of pooled 30 moderate to high activity (UMF gt 14.1) samples. It was shown that the marker compound regression equation is capable of predicting the approximate UMF activity in both active and inactive manuka and kanuka honey samples.  The leaf oil profiles of manuka (L. scoparium) plants that yielded active and inactive manuka honeys were characterized using an adaption of the micro-scale extraction and GC/FID or GC/MS, technique developed by Brophy et al. (1989). Six major groups of volatile (steam distillable) compounds (monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated sesquiterpenes [excluding eudesmols], eudesmols, triketones, and nor-triketones) and 3 groups of non-volatile or semi-volatile compounds (flavonoids, grandiflorone and nor-grandiflorone) were recognized in the leaf oil components. The active manuka honeys do not appear to be derived uniquely, or predominantly, from a single leaf oil chemotype.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand Unifloral Honeys</field><field name="subject">Manuka Honey</field><field name="subject">UMF</field><field name="subject">GC/MS</field><field name="subject">Manuka Leaf Oil</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational transformations in the New Zealand retirement village sector:   A critical-rhetorical and -discursive analysis of promotion, community, and resident participation.</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Mary Louisa</field><field name="description">This thesis examines quotcustomer-focusedquot communication and resident participation within the retirement village sector which is one part of the increasingly quotmarketisedquot aged-care services in New Zealand. In this respect the sector is no different from other domains of consumer life where marketing-oriented organisations aim to find out what their customers want and give it to them. This research examines communication related to customer-focused organisational activities and residents' enactment of participation within retirement village organisation (RVO) settings with respect to these processes of marketisation. Taking a critical-interpretive perspective, the thesis undertakes a collective case study involving two major New Zealand RVOs. Both organisations were defined as quotretirement villagesquot within the meaning of the Retirement Villages Act 2003, established in the 1990s, and offered quotretirement livingquot independent housing and apartments across a range of locations.  A significant part of the study also examined publicly available promotional material from six RVOs operating multiple sites in various New Zealand locations. This thesis explores retirement villages as co-productions between the corporate entities that develop and market villages and the residents who live in them.  The thesis also explores RVO rhetoric about quotretirement living for active 55 plusquot, RVO enactment of customer focused communication and activities, and residents responses to and expectations of both. It is argued that this co-production has implications for residents' participation, their roles and relationships with employees, as well as for organisational communication processes and structures. The rhetorical and critical discourse analysis reveals the complexity of what quotparticipationquot means for the residents. Through a close examination of these meanings, the thesis extends current understandings of relationships between quotcustomersquot and quotcustomer-focusedquot organisations and highlights the role of older people in Western Society as co-producers of the very product they purchase: the retirement village. It also raises practical and theoretical issues for organisational communication. At the practical level it highlights how communication messages, structures and processes within RVOs experience tensions in meeting the needs of both internal, current, and long-term customers, and external, potential, and future customers. The thesis offers insights into issues of individual action and freedom within the frame of market-driven and avowedly quotcustomer-focusedquot organisations and consequently suggests a reconsideration of participation in organisations in which customers are also quotinsidersquot.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Retirement communities</field><field name="subject">Participation</field><field name="subject">Marketisation</field><field name="subject">Rhetorical Cricitism</field><field name="subject">Discourse Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Interface between science and law:  What is science for members of New Zealand's Environment Court?</field><field name="creator">Forret, Joan Boyce</field><field name="description">This study investigates the interface between science and law with reference to models of science described by members of New Zealand's Environment Court.  The aim of the research is to identify differences and consistencies between the members of the Court in the way that they articulate their understanding of science and of scientific evidence.  This research also aims to locate those individual models of science within a wider philosophical discourse concerning the nature of science.  The research adopts a qualitative and interpretive approach that focuses on understanding the detail of contextual interactions arising from interviews with eight Environment Judges and 13 Commissioners.  The interview group comprised all of the judges of the Court during the research period (1999 - 2000) and all but one permanent Commissioner.  The analysis of interviews show a wide range of views concerning the scope and nature of science.  Criteria significant to each individual's model of science have been identified as a series of micro themes.  Those micro themes differ between individuals as to the combinations of criteria significant when locating the boundary between science and non-science.  The analysis of interviews also identifies three macro themes that describe whether and how individuals differentiate science, technology and expertise.  That analysis identifies a group of interviewees, comprising both judges and commissioners, that equates science with expertise without distinction as to any knowledge component or process considerations.  The analysis of interview responses adopts a boundary-work approach that identifies how individuals locate the boundary between science and non-science through their articulation of the micro themes significant to their model of science.  The study contributes to the discourse concerning the relationship of science and law within modern society.  That discourse commonly addresses the appropriate legal framework to assess questions involving scientific expertise and invariably describes the legal process and the role of expert and decision maker within that process.  However, that discourse rarely articulates the meaning of the terms science, scientist, or technology, assuming that science is a self-evident concept, its meaning having universal application and acceptance.  This research challenges that approach and identifies wide differences in the models of science held by individual decision makers and differences in their expectations of evidence from expert witnesses.  Aside from the implications of the research results for the discourse concerning the relationship of science and law, this research also has practical implications for the evaluation of expert scientific evidence within an adversarial system of law, and for expert evidence before the Environment Court.  Suggestions to improve communication both within the Court and between the Court and parties appearing before it are made with a view to identifying consistent and fair expectations of experts and their evidence.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">scientific evidence</field><field name="subject">boundary work</field><field name="subject">scientific witness</field><field name="subject">expert evidence</field><field name="subject">expert witness</field><field name="subject">Environment Court</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2667</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oceanographic Considerations for the Management and Protection of Surfing Breaks</field><field name="creator">Scarfe, Bradley Edward</field><field name="description">Although the physical characteristics of surfing breaks are well described in the literature, there is little specific research on surfing and coastal management. Such research is required because coastal engineering has had significant impacts to surfing breaks, both positive and negative. Strategic planning and environmental impact assessment methods, a central tenet of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM), are recommended by this thesis to maximise surfing amenities. The research reported here identifies key oceanographic considerations required for ICZM around surfing breaks including: surfing wave parameters; surfing break components; relationship between surfer skill, surfing manoeuvre type and wave parameters; wind effects on waves; currents; geomorphic surfing break categorisation; beach-state and morphology; and offshore wave transformations. Key coastal activities that can have impacts to surfing breaks are identified. Environmental data types to consider during coastal studies around surfing breaks are presented and geographic information systems (GIS) are used to manage and interpret such information. To monitor surfing breaks, a shallow water multibeam echo sounding system was utilised and a RTK GPS water level correction and hydrographic GIS methodology developed. Including surfing in coastal management requires coastal engineering solutions that incorporate surfing. As an example, the efficacy of the artificial surfing reef (ASR) at Mount Maunganui, New Zealand, was evaluated. GIS, multibeam echo soundings, oceanographic measurements, photography, and wave modelling were all applied to monitor sea floor morphology around the reef. Results showed that the beach-state has more cellular circulation since the reef was installed, and a groin effect on the offshore bar was caused by the structure within the monitoring period, trapping sediment updrift and eroding sediment downdrift. No identifiable shoreline salient was observed. Landward of the reef, a scour hole ~3 times the surface area of the reef has formed. The current literature on ASRs has primarily focused on reef shape and its role in creating surfing waves. However, this study suggests that impacts to the offshore bar, beach-state, scour hole and surf zone hydrodynamics should all be included in future surfing reef designs. More real world reef studies, including ongoing monitoring of existing surfing reefs are required to validate theoretical concepts in the published literature.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aramoana Beach Dunedin (New Zealand)</field><field name="subject">ArcGIS</field><field name="subject">ArcSDE</field><field name="subject">artificial surfing reef</field><field name="subject">backscatter</field><field name="subject">Baseline Data Collection</field><field name="subject">bathymetry</field><field name="subject">bathymetric surveying</field><field name="subject">beach morphodynamics</field><field name="subject">beach-state and morphology</field><field name="subject">breaking wave height</field><field name="subject">coastal engineering</field><field name="subject">coastal environment</field><field name="subject">coastal management</field><field name="subject">coastal monitoring</field><field name="subject">coastal processes</field><field name="subject">coastal structures</field><field name="subject">currents</field><field name="subject">economic value</field><field name="subject">EIA</field><field name="subject">environmental data management</field><field name="subject">environmental impact assessment</field><field name="subject">geographic information systems</field><field name="subject">geoid</field><field name="subject">geomorphic surfing break categorisation</field><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="subject">groin</field><field name="subject">hydrodynamic modelling</field><field name="subject">hydrographic surveying</field><field name="subject">hydrography</field><field name="subject">ICZM</field><field name="subject">incline plane modelling</field><field name="subject">integrated coastal zone management</field><field name="subject">Main Beach Mount Maunganui (New Zealand)</field><field name="subject">Manu Bay Boat Ramp Raglan (New Zealand)</field><field name="subject">measuring water levels</field><field name="subject">Mission Bay Jetties San Diego (California)</field><field name="subject">morphological coupling</field><field name="subject">multibeam echo soundings</field><field name="subject">oceanography</field><field name="subject">offshore wave transformations</field><field name="subject">Palm Beach Reefs Gold Coast (Australia)</field><field name="subject">relationship between surfer skill surfing manoeuvre type and wave parameters</field><field name="subject">RTK GPS</field><field name="subject">salient</field><field name="subject">surf zone hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">surfing break components</field><field name="subject">surfing reefs</field><field name="subject">surfing tourism</field><field name="subject">surfing wave climate</field><field name="subject">surfing wave parameters</field><field name="subject">Tay Street Mount Maunganui (New Zealand)</field><field name="subject">The Whangamata Bar Whangamata (New Zealand)</field><field name="subject">wave breaking intensity</field><field name="subject">wave climate</field><field name="subject">wave focusing</field><field name="subject">wave modelling</field><field name="subject">wave peel angle</field><field name="subject">wave section length</field><field name="subject">wind effects on waves</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2668</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On-farm fractionation of milk components</field><field name="creator">Chand, Amita</field><field name="description">Methods for on-farm extraction of low-concentration (minor) proteins from raw whole bovine milk directly after milking were explored. These minor proteins have high commercial value. Lactoferrin (LF) and lactoperoxidase (LP) were used as model proteins for extraction using cation exchange chromatography. Laboratory fractionations showed that milk could be processed by conventional column chromatography without excessive column backpressures if resin with large particles sizes were used and the temperature was high enough so fat in the milk was malleable; ideally the milk should be near the secretion temperature of 37oC. Processing parameters such as equilibrium and dynamic capacities were determined for SP Sepharose &#8482; (GE Healthcare Technologies) and Bio Rex 70 (BioRad Laboratories) resins. SP Sepharose Big Beads (SP BB) were found to be more suitable than BR 70, for raw whole milk processing due to the larger size (200 um). Design considerations showed that column chromatography was not the most practical method for on-farm processing of fresh, raw whole milk. Trials with a single-stage stirred tank showed that SP BB resin could extract up to 65% of LF (initial LF concentration of 0.5 mg/mL) with a 10-minute adsorption time. The composite non-linear (CNL) model of Rowe et al. (1999) was used to describe LF uptake by SP BB resin in raw whole milk with initial LF concentrations of 0 to 1.0 mg/mL and resin:milk volume ratios of 0.010, 0.012, 0.017 and 0.024 over 45-minute contact times. The CNL model could be used to predict LF yields if initial feed concentration, milk and resin volumes, and contact times were known. Laboratory extractions showed that processing did not significantly affect bulk milk composition (fat, protein, lactose and total solids), indicating that the milk could be used for conventional processing after the minor proteins had been extracted. Resin cleaning and regeneration studies, using a procedure similar to that recommended by the resin supplier, showed that the Sepharose resin had not degraded and there was no significant decrease in binding capacity after 50 extraction cycles. A Protein Fractionation Robot (PFR) prototype based on a single-stage stirred tank and the operating parameters obtained from the laboratory trials was designed, assembled and coupled to an Automated Milking System (AMS) to process fresh, raw whole milk from individual cows immediately after milking. The LF and LP extracted from the milk from 16 individual cows were 19.7 - 55.2% (35.6   10.2%) and 21.2 - 99.5% (87.1   12.0%) respectively. Generally, higher extraction levels were obtained at higher resin:milk ratios. The amount of LF extracted on-farm agreed within 14.1   9.8% of those predicted by the CNL model, with predicted values generally being higher. The experimental on-farm adsorption values were calculated using data of LF recovered after elution, so differences between actual and predicted values may be due to losses during post-adsorption processing. Economic feasibility studies, based on experimental data from the PFR and realistic wholesale prices for LF and LP ($400 and $150/kg respectively) showed that PFR-based processing is economically viable if the farmer is paid for the LF and LP produced as well as the bulk milk. This system would have a payback period of approximately five years and an internal rate of return of 14.5%. Further case studies determined the sensitivity of the economics to various operating parameters and value/cost assumptions, including producing recombinant human protein from transgenic bovine milk. These studies showed that the higher the value of the processed raw milk, the higher the absorptive capacity of the resin, and the higher the value of the extracted protein, the more favourable the economics. In the extreme case of producing a very high value therapeutic protein (e.g. $20 000), the payback period could be as low as 0.3 years, with an internal rate of return of 818%.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">on-farm</field><field name="subject">extraction</field><field name="subject">chromatography</field><field name="subject">lactoferrin</field><field name="subject">lactoperoxidase</field><field name="subject">protein</field><field name="subject">fractionation</field><field name="subject">raw whole milk</field><field name="subject">bovine</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2669</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Virtue and self-interest</field><field name="creator">Hardwicke, Tery Vance</field><field name="description">Why be moral? One possible, and compelling answer is that to act morally is in an agent's self-interest. Such an answer can be either elevationist (broadly speaking the Aristotelian/Platonic approach) where self-interest is elevated to coincide with living the good life, or reductionist where morality is defined as acting in an agent's self-interest.  Elevationist moral theories appear flawed. If you are in possession of information that, if divulged, will bring about the deaths of others then it may be virtuous to stay silent. However, if staying silent results in you being slowly tortured to death in an effort to extract the information then it seems bizarre to suggest that in doing so you are flourishing, happy, or acting out of self-interest.  Reductionist moral theories, acting for the 'good of self' rather than the 'good of others', are widely considered to be the antithesis of morality. Moral philosophers tend to attack such positions claiming that the doctrine of egoism is unworkable. It is commonly claimed that any theory which recommends 'an agent do x if x is in the agent's best interest' is inconsistent, incoherent, or contradictory and fails to meet the basic requirements of a moral theory (notably the requirement of universalisability).  I begin this thesis with an examination of ethical egoism in its most widely known consequentialist form; i.e. an agent ought to act so as to bring about the best consequences for that agent. I examine the major criticisms of this theory and demonstrate that the axioms of egoism can be developed so as to overcome these criticisms. I argue that consequentialist based ethical egoism is coherent, consistent and noncontradictory. However, I go on to argue that while egoism can be formulated in a manner that overcomes all the aforementioned analytic criticisms it is a flawed moral theory in that within certain contexts the action deemed morally correct by egoism is, as a matter of fact, morally pernicious. That a theory contains a flaw is not reason enough to discard the entire theory and I go on to contend that the problem with egoism is the consequentialist approach, not the fact that it is based on self-interest. In Part 2 of the thesis I abandon the consequentialist approach and examine the possibility of a flourishing-based form of ethical egoism. I further develop the axioms of egoism established in Part 1 through an examination of the concept of flourishing (as commonly associated with virtue ethics). Ultimately I tread a path between the consequentialist and elevationist positions. While I do not elevate self-interest to acting virtuously I do contend that an egoist must adopt certain virtues if that egoist is to have the best possibility to flourish. However, I further contend that an egoist ought to act so as to promote that which the egoist values and that this agent-relative hierarchy of values, which necessarily contains certain virtues, determines the manner in which an egoist ought to act.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Egoism</field><field name="subject">Flourishing</field><field name="subject">Virtue</field><field name="subject">Rand</field><field name="subject">Groundhog Day</field><field name="subject">Morality</field><field name="subject">Self-Interest</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heteronormativity and early childhood education: Social justice and some puzzling queries.</field><field name="creator">Gunn, Alexandra Claire</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the discursive production of heteronormativity in the historical and present day contexts of early childhood education in Aotearoa New Zealand.  A Foucauldian genealogical investigation of early childhood policy and documents revealed how heteronormative discourses shaped understandings in early childhood education in the twentieth century.  Then a study of practices as accounted for and produced in focus group interviews showed how heteronormative discourses were confirmed and resisted in the present day.   The thesis argues that the locus of heteronormativity in early childhood education centres on constructions of the family, of genders and of sexualities.  It sought to investigate whether heteronormative discourses were shaping practices in early childhood education, and if so how.  Following the writing of a genealogy of heteronormativity in early childhood education, the fieldwork of the study entailed three rounds of focus group interviews with queer teacher, queer ally and teacher educator participants.  Discussions in the interviews were provoked by dilemmas of heterosexism, homophobia and heteronormativity in early childhood settings.  Participants were asked to talk about what they thought was occurring in the dilemmas and they were also asked to share examples of practices from their own professional lives where same-sex sexualities had been troubled or affirmed.  The texts produced from the focus group interviews were read the same way as the historical and policy and documents.  Foucault's discourse analysis combined with questions from Davies' (1994) study of teaching practices, and queer theory provided a theoretical framework through which I was able to explore relations between constructions of genders, families, and sexualities; concepts of insiders and outsiders; and notions of power.  A queer turn in the project enlarged the focus of the study to investigate how heteronormative discourse might have been shaping the research interviews too.  A discourse of silence along with a discourse of risk was interpreted as contributing to heteronormativity in this work.  A strategy designed to assist teachers to interrupt heteronormativity was explored.  It allowed teachers to bring together ideas and concepts that would constitute families and parents in ways inclusive of and broader to the (hetero)norm.   In the study, teachers, children and parents were shown to draw on (hetero)normalising discourses in their interactions with each other in early childhood education.  Such activity limited opportunities for valid alternative options to heterosexuality to be known.  This meant that heterosexuality was repeatedly constituted as dominant and normative, thus supporting heteronormativity.  Constructions of genders, families and sexualities in the study were regularly shaped by traditional and essentialising discourses that positioned heterosexual sexuality as normal and non-heterosexual sexualities as not.  These in combination with other discourses, such as a discourse of developmentalism, provided few opportunities for non-heterosexual sexualities to be recognised, valued and included in early childhood education. The extent to which socially just and inclusive policy aims in early childhood education might therefore be met in practice, could be seriously questioned.   However, examples of practices that worked to expand opportunities for the recognition of diverse families and sexualities in early childhood education were also documented.  These provided evidence that some teachers, parents and children in some circumstances can and do access and use discourses of social justice, family and sexual diversity, inclusion and human rights.  Sustained access to these was not documented, in fact, discourses of social justice, family and sexual diversity, and inclusion were often immediately countered by limiting and (hetero)normalising responses.  The thesis concludes with suggestions as to how such processes might be explored and challenged so that more teachers, more children, more families can enjoy recognition and welcome in early childhood education settings designed to include.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Early childhood education</field><field name="subject">heteronormativity</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">nuclear families</field><field name="subject">sexualities</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">social justice</field><field name="subject">inclusion</field><field name="subject">Te Whaariki</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2671</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Phosphorus Fertiliser on Soil Organic Matter Composition of Hill Country Pasture</field><field name="creator">Binoka, Danfung Teresa</field><field name="description">Soil organic matter is important as storage for carbon and nutrients, supporting soil structure, and as a filter for pollutants entering the soil ecosystem. The recovery of soil organic matter in depleted soils can take decades, or even hundreds of years. It has been assumed that in non-eroding pasture, soil carbon levels either increase or not change over time. However, some recent studies have suggested that fertiliser addition to pasture soils may contribute to decreases in soil carbon content. My hypotheses were: 1. As P fertiliser loadings increase the soil carbon content and C:N ratio will decrease. 2. Changes in C pools will be greater in the more active pool (readily available carbon, and microbial biomass carbon) within the soil total carbon The study was undertaken at a long term fertiliser trial, established in 1980, at the Whatawhata Hill Country Research Station west of Hamilton, New Zealand. The fertiliser trial has P fertiliser application rates maintained since 1984. Olsen P, total C, total N, labile carbon, respirable carbon, specific respiration rate, microbial biomass C, microbial quotient, mineralised N, microbial biomass N, microbial N quotient, and mineralised N per microbial biomass nitrogen, C:N ratio, and soil pH were measured on soil samples collected from 12 paddocks with six P fertiliser loading (0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 kg P ha-1 yr-1). As expected, the available P (Olsen P) increased significantly (P less than 0.001) with increasing P fertiliser application rate. Total carbon, labile carbon, and total nitrogen all decreased significantly (P less than 0.05) with increasing P fertiliser application. No significant relationships were found between P fertiliser and respirable carbon, microbial carbon, microbial (C) quotient, microbial specific respiration, microbial nitrogen, microbial (N) quotient, mineralised N, or C:N ratio. The first hypothesis was rejected as the C:N ratio did not change with increased P fertiliser application. However, both C and N decreased with increased P fertiliser application. The second hypothesis was, therefore, accepted in part because there was a decrease in labile carbon (readily available carbon) and total carbon, with P fertiliser application, but no relationship was evident for the respirable carbon and microbial biomass.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil organic matter</field><field name="subject">fertiliser</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">soil carbon</field><field name="subject">microbial carbon</field><field name="subject">microbial respiration</field><field name="subject">nitrogen mineralised</field><field name="subject">microbial nitrogen</field><field name="subject">C:N ratio</field><field name="subject">agricultural intensification</field><field name="subject">Olsen P</field><field name="subject">hill country</field><field name="subject">pasture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Demography of nineteenth century New Zealand education: gender and regional differences in school retention</field><field name="creator">Hodder, Catherine</field><field name="description">Abstract  This thesis examines the progress of pupils through New Zealand schools in the last two decades of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth century. The purpose of this study was to apply demographic techniques to primary historical education data to enable the progress of pupils to be quantified and to allow comparisons to be made among different Education Districts and longitudinally over a period of some three decades.  The present work applies demographic methods using cohort and period analyses to overcome difficulties in direct comparisons of historical education data because of differences in population structure and differing examination pass rates in various Education Districts. This approach allows the determination of retention rates of pupils both by age and by level from Standard 4 to Standard 6 using primary data from the nineteenth century. In addition, gender differences in retention by age are analysed from the 1880s to the end of the first decade of the twentieth century. Previous published work considered school attendance only in general terms and usually on a national basis, but generally without analysing specific educational data on gender differences. Studies prior to the present work have suggested that in the nineteenth century Education Districts differed in school enrolments (Hodder, 1996) and it is thus likely that there were differences in school retention of pupils between various Education Districts. Pilot research to the present work developed demographic methods for studying retention of pupil populations allowing for changes in the number and structure of the pupils populations over time (Hodder, 2005). These pilot methods are applied in the present research to study pupil retention in all thirteen Education Districts over the approximately 30 years from the 1880s. In addition to age and level cohorts, gender differences are analysed. Direct comparisons among all Education Districts and over time are now possible.  This study has used a novel approach to the analysis of historical education data. The results enable comparisons to be made among all thirteen Education Districts and across several decades; such comparisons have not previously been possible and will facilitate future research on the possible factors affecting pupil retention particularly in relation to employment opportunities for school leavers and differences according to gender.  __________ Hodder, C.

This thesis addresses the lack of attention in previous experiential studies to the relationship between heritage buildings and tourism. Specifically, this thesis explores the influence of heritage buildings in shaping international tourists' experiences of a particular region of New Zealand: Hawke's Bay. This research sought insight into the specific attributes of heritage buildings that influenced the experiences of international tourists visiting the region, and examined the relative importance of heritage buildings for international tourism to Hawke's Bay, as perceived by international tourists visiting the region. In this way, results are assumed in the personal constructs of individual consumers (Beeho  Prentice, 1997; Prentice, Witt  Hamer, 1998; McIntosh  Siggs, 2005). An increased understanding of the relationship between heritage buildings and tourism is essential in strengthening support for preservation, for product development and promotion.  A mixed-methodology comprising of 50 semi-structured interviews, 66 photograph-supported interviews and 354 structured questionnaires was adopted. Hawke's Bay's heritage buildings were found to have an important influence on tourists' experiences of the region, visually and as part of the narratives of their reported experiences. Attributes of Hawke's Bay's heritage buildings that influenced tourists' experiences of the region included their architecture, exterior and interior design, colour, history and associated stories. Furthermore, the interviews elicited three key experiential themes that emerged from respondents' narratives of their experiences in Hawke's Bay. They are; 'visual appeal', 'personal reflections' and 'engaging experiences'. Specifically, it was found that a townscape is not a passive space. Heritage buildings render the townscape an experiential place filled with emotion, mindfulness, engagement, and imbued with personal meaning. Visitors in effect created their own experiences through their active interaction with the environment; rendering it relevant to a context they were personally interested in, or which held personal significance for them. Analysis of the questionnaires revealed that, as perceived by international tourists, heritage buildings are important to a region; a significant proportion of respondents indicated that they would theoretically be willing to pay some money to ensure the preservation of Hawke's Bay's heritage buildings. This thesis evidences the important relationship between heritage buildings and tourism, and future research is advocated to advance upon the conclusions made in this research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">heritage buildings</field><field name="subject">heritage tourism</field><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">tourist experiences</field><field name="subject">Hawke's Bay</field><field name="subject">Art Deco</field><field name="subject">Spanish Mission</field><field name="subject">commerical buildings</field><field name="subject">experiential tourism</field><field name="subject">visitor experiences</field><field name="subject">architecture and tourism</field><field name="subject">buildings and tourism</field><field name="subject">Napier</field><field name="subject">Hastings</field><field name="subject">heritage</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variability in Extended and Alternating Extinction</field><field name="creator">Neshausen, Leanne</field><field name="description">Hens were trained to peck a square stimulus on a touch-sensitive screen under an FR5 reinforcement schedule for a maximum of 30 reinforcers (taking approximately 10 minutes). Then hens experienced extinction sessions of 40 minutes duration. For a total of six conditions, reinforcement and extinction conditions were alternated. Each condition consisted of between approximately 7 and 10 sessions. Results show that structures developed during conditioning remain in extinction, at least for the duration of previous reinforcement sessions. After approximately 10 minutes, behaviour becomes more variable. There was also an absence of any 'extinction burst'. Extended extinction conditions, and alternating extinction conditions with reinforcement conditions had little effect on the variability of behaviour, but did influence the rate of responding. Responding persisted a little longer before gradually declining across sessions in the first extinction condition. In extinction conditions 2 and 3 responding tended to occur more as 'peaks'; short periods of increased responding with periods of non-responding between peaks.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Extinction</field><field name="subject">behavioural variability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbiological Quality of Toroi:  A M&#257;ori food delicacy</field><field name="creator">Dixon, Lorraine Louise</field><field name="description">A study was undertaken to determine the food safety of the fermented M&#257;ori delicacy, Toroi.  Ten batches of Toroi were prepared by a commonly used traditional method that consisted of boiling the vegetable component, either watercress or puha, and combining it with chopped mussel flesh.  The mixture was cooled and then stored in a refrigerator for up to eight months to allow natural fermentation to take place.  All ingredients were sourced from retail outlets.  The Toroi was examined at intervals over eight months for a range of pathogens (seven in all) that have been related to incidents of food poisoning in ready-to-eat foods in New Zealand.  The survival of a faecal contamination indicator, the laboratory grown strain Escherichia coli NZRM 916, was mapped over eight months.  Two strategies to prevent the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in Toroi were also investigated.  Only one of the seven pathogens sought was recovered from any sample.  This pathogen was Bacillus cereus, a spore-former known to be associated with vegetables.  All batches contained B. cereus on the day of preparation but after two weeks refrigerated storage there was no further recovery from any sample.  There was a very low incidence of natural E. coli in the Toroi, consistent with levels permitted in mussels sold in retail outlets.  The laboratory grown strain, E. coli declined substantially over two months and was not recovered from any samples at eight months.  A laboratory grown strain of Listeria monocytogenes, (L70) was added to Toroi and grew well with an increase in concentration of about seven-fold, over 19 days storage in a refrigerator.  A bacteriocin producing lactic acid bacterium, Lactobacillus sake Lb706, was added in combined culture with L. monocytogenes to Toroi.  It was found that at least 5 x108 L. sake cells were required as an inoculum to ensure elimination of L. monocytogenes from the Toroi.  When a purified bacteriocin; nisin, was added, a concentration of 10 mg g-1 in the Toroi was required to eliminate L. monocytogenes.  The inhibition study results suggest that unacceptably high inocula or purified bacteriocin would be required to prevent the growth of L. monocytogenes in Toroi.  The results of this suggest that Toroi be prepared from mussels either purchased from a retail outlet or harvested from sites known to be free from contamination.  Toroi should be safe to eat if prepared carefully, chilled promptly and thoroughly and allowed to ferment for at least two weeks.  In addition, care should be taken to maintain Toroi at refrigerated temperatures until it is eaten.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Toroi</field><field name="subject">faecal contamination</field><field name="subject">watercress</field><field name="subject">mussels</field><field name="subject">Sonchus spp.</field><field name="subject">Listeria monocytogenes</field><field name="subject">Lactic Acid Bacteria</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">(Re)presenting the Past: Historiographical and Theoretical Implications of the Historical Docudrama</field><field name="creator">McKeown, Luke Daniel</field><field name="description">This thesis contributes to the growing body of scholarship surrounding historical and filmic representations of the past. Moreover, it seeks to further the understanding and practical use of this sub-field in history by examining two films: Amistad (1997); and, The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006). Building on the insistence of scholars such as Robert Rosenstone and Hayden White, this thesis seeks to evaluate historical films on their own terms as representations of the past that must be judged according to their own conventions. Cinema's attraction to historical subjects is not a recent phenomenon. However, the past two decades, have seen a marked increase in the academic critique of 'historical films' - most notably Hollywood features and television documentaries. Moreover, the appetite of the general public for filmic treatment of historical topics continues unabated. While it is agreed that historical film cannot be judged according to the criteria used in accessing traditional modes of historical representation, there is little agreement about what criteria, precisely, should be used in evaluating historical films' historical attributes and implications. This thesis commences with a general theoretical and methodological survey of the literature in this relatively new sub-field. It then analyses the film Amistad and its reception and criticism amongst historical professionals. This analysis, coupled with the findings of the first chapter, forms the basis for an original and independent review of The Wind That Shakes the Barley, a film that has not yet been widely critiqued by historians. The thesis suggests how historical films may be fruitfully evaluated in ways that are sympathetic both to the peculiar exigencies of the medium and the traditional concerns of historical scholarship.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">film</field><field name="subject">Hollywood</field><field name="subject">cinema</field><field name="subject">The Wind That Shakes the Barley</field><field name="subject">Amistad</field><field name="subject">Robert Rosenstone</field><field name="subject">Hayden White</field><field name="subject">Robert Toplin</field><field name="subject">historiophoty</field><field name="subject">historiography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In a World of its Own:  How Operative Closure Limits the Law's Ability to Protect Children from Maltreatment.</field><field name="creator">Peploe, Matthew</field><field name="description">New Zealand's figures for child maltreatment are consistently amongst the highest in the OECD. The purpose of this thesis is to understand what the legal system can do to protect children in New Zealand from maltreatment and why legal responses to child maltreatment often appear to be ineffectual or of limited effect.  This thesis uses the theories of Luhman and Teubner to argue that the law's ability to protect children from maltreatment is limited because the legal system creates and responds to its own abstract world.  This process arises from the functional requirements of the law and its operation as an autopoietic system of power that produces its own abstract knowledge about the world.  The legal system's function within New Zealand society is to stabilise behavioural expectations and maintain society's coherence and it does so by reducing the complexity of subjective human existence into binary alternatives.  However, this process of reducing complexity limits the way in which the law produces its knowledge about the world and controls how power is distributed within the law's abstract world to such an extent that the legal system is closed from the world of subjective experience.  This closure from the world outside the legal system limits the law's ability to regulate and reform that outside world and protect the children who live within it.  By identifying these limits, this thesis will contribute to an understanding of the limits of the law's ability to protect children from maltreatment and thereby improve the effectiveness of New Zealand society's attempts to protect its children.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Law</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">maltreatment</field><field name="subject">operative closure</field><field name="subject">systems theory</field><field name="subject">Luhman</field><field name="subject">Teubner</field><field name="subject">Habermas</field><field name="subject">Derrida</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lowering Sperm Dose Rates in Frozen Semen for Bovine Artificial Breeding</field><field name="creator">Pitt, Colin John</field><field name="description">The New Zealand Dairy industry relies on artificial breeding to produce high genetic merit replacement stock. Proven bull semen is extended and preserved as either ambient temperature product or as frozen doses. High fertility is essential to maintain synchronicity of lactation with the spring surge of grass growth. To improve efficiency in the utilization of the very best bulls producers try to lower sperm dose rates without compromising fertility. Livestock Improvement Corporation's (LIC) Long Last Liquid &#8482; (LLL) is most commonly used during the peak season and is their most important product. However, shortfalls and specifically targeted matings are met with frozen semen. Lowering sperm dose rates in both liquid and frozen semen maximises the usage of elite sires increasing genetic gain, lowering overheads and garnering premium prices for the semen producer. A product for improving frozen semen technology was developed whereby a discrete quantity of pretreated semen was placed alongside a beneficial post-thawing redilution medium in a standard semen straw. This emulated a larger-scale process developed to freeze semen in times of low demand and redilution into the LLL form for use as an ambient temperature product. This rediluted product has been proved to enhance semen survival and to allow fertility to be maintained at sperm dose rates lower than the widely accepted standard for frozen semen. The physical packaging of the semen into the industry standard single dose straw in a configuration that separated incompatible components was novel. This configuration was essential to prevent damage to the sperm during the freezing process from low solubility components in the post-thaw redilution medium. Separation between the semen and diluent within the straw was achieved by the introduction of a gas partition or air bubble between the two liquids. A large-scale field trial showed that the new product could produce savings of up to 25% of the sperm needed for a semen dose to achieve equivalent fertility. Furthermore, the production cost per dose was lowered in comparison to the standard semen processing system used at LIC.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">semen</field><field name="subject">sperm</field><field name="subject">frozen semen</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">artificial breeding</field><field name="subject">artificial insemination</field><field name="subject">AB</field><field name="subject">bovine</field><field name="subject">cattle</field><field name="subject">cow</field><field name="subject">bull</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of using Think-Pair-Share during Guided Reading Lessons</field><field name="creator">Carss, Wendy Diane</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to describe the effects of Think-Pair-Share strategies, used during Guided Reading lessons, on reading achievement.  Think-Pair-Share is a co-operative teaching strategy that includes three components; time for thinking, time for sharing with a partner and time for each pair to share back to a larger group.  The use of Think-Pair-Share unites the cognitive and social aspects of learning, promoting the development of thinking and the construction of knowledge.  The strategy lends itself to inclusion within Guided Reading lessons, where the focus is on meaningful discussion around text and promotion of the use of comprehension skills and strategies to foster comprehension.  The literature review describes the effectiveness of explicit comprehension strategy instruction within the context of small group discussion.  Strategies that foster cooperative learning have been successful in developing interpersonal skills, cognitive skills and metacognitive awareness.  There is very little research documenting the effects of the use of the Think-Pair-Share strategy.  The study took place in a Year 6 classroom with two intervention groups, each containing six children.  One group was reading above their chronological age and the other below.  Control groups reading at these levels were also used. Three variations of Think-Pair-Share were utilised during the eight week intervention period; Predict-Pair-Share, Image-Pair-Share and Summarise-Pair-Share, and the research centred on the effects of the intervention on reading comprehension.  A quasi-experimental design was employed using a pre-test, post-test format and a mix of quantitative and qualitative measures to ascertain the effects.  The results confirmed the positive effects of the strategy on reading achievement, especially for those students reading above their chronological age, although an extended period of intervention may have had more significant effects on those reading below.  Positive effects on aspects of oral language use, thinking, metacognitive awareness, and the development of reading comprehension strategies were noted with both of the intervention groups.  Results have significance for those concerned with implementing effective literacy practice.  They demonstrate the versatility of the Think-Pair-Share strategy as a tool to foster conversation, and one that can be adapted to suit the learning focus and the needs of particular groups of students.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Think-Pair-Share</field><field name="subject">Guided Reading</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forecasting seasonal drawdowns in Whangamata town supply wells</field><field name="creator">Jelley, Neil</field><field name="description">The coastal township of Whangamata's reticulated water supply is provided by a number of groundwater bores, extracting water from local fractured rhyolite and andesite aquifers. A need has arisen to create a greater understanding of the aquifers, because of an increased demand for water abstraction. Water demand in Whangamata increases dramatically during the summer vacation period. Occupant numbers increase from 4,000 up to 50,000 during peak times, resulting in increased water demand. Over the past five years an increase in groundwater abstraction has produced an evident downward trend in bore water levels. Electrical conductivity is also increasing in several aquifers, posing a realistic threat of sea water intrusion and questioning the sustainability of current abstraction volumes. Multiple linear regression and an artificial neural network model were investigated as simple empirical forecasting tools for well drawdowns to predict the effect of future increases in groundwater demand. This approach was adopted as opposed to a groundwater numerical model because of poor time resolution of available data and the complex, fractured nature of the aquifer. By using pumping volumes as variables, seasonal bore water level variations and long term trends were predicted. The models were evaluated with independent validation data sets. The actual ability of a model to predict bore water level seasonal variation and long term trends was assessed using a comparison with a moving average of the validation data set. Multiple linear regression proved superior to the neural network in almost every bore modelled. Although neural networks proved capable of modelling seasonal bore water level variations it was not to the same degree of accuracy as the regression approach. The regression approach yielded a modified index of agreement of 0.6-0.74 when comparing a moving average of observed data with the validation data sets. The developed models were used to forecast well water levels with varying abstraction volumes aiming to prevent further long term decline in bore water levels.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">coastal</field><field name="subject">sea water intrusion</field><field name="subject">Coromandel</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Products and Processes of Cone-Building Eruptions at North Crater, Tongariro</field><field name="creator">Griffin, Anna Marie</field><field name="description">North Crater occupies the north-western quadrant of the Tongariro Volcanic Centre and represents one of at least eleven vents which have been active on Tongariro since the last glacial maximum. The most recent cone-forming activity at North Crater is thought to have occurred between 14-12 ka ago to produce the distinct, wide, flattopped andesite cone. This project focused mainly on the cone-building eruptions at North Crater, including stratigraphic correlations with distal tephra, interpreting eruptive processes, and establishing the sequence of events during cone construction. Detailed field work identified key stratigraphic sections and facies in the proximal, medial and distal environments. These sections allowed stratigraphic correlations to be made between proximal cone-building facies and distal sheet-forming facies at North Crater, and established a complete North Crater eruption stratigraphy. In the proximal environment, welded and non to poorly welded facies formed from fallout of a lava-fountain, pyroclastic flow or as fallout from a convecting plume. In the medial and distal environment, the lithofacies consist of fallout from a convecting plume and minor pyroclastic flow. Convective fall and non to poorly welded pyroclastic flow deposits dominate the lower eruption stratigraphy suggesting explosive eruptions involving a gas-rich magma. A change to welded deposits produced from lava-fountaining occurs later in the cone-building sequence and suggest a change to lower explosively and eruption of gas-poor magma. Grain size, componentry data, density, petrography and SEM analysis were carried out on representative samples to characterise the different facies, and reveal information about eruption processes. The non to poorly welded deposits are typically made up of vesicular pumice, scoria and mingled clasts of sub-rounded bombs and lapilli. The welded facies are relatively dense and clast outlines are often difficult to distinguish. The eruptives are porphyritic with abundant plagioclase gt clinopyroxene gt orthopyroxene gt opaques. Quartzofeldspathic crustal xenoliths are common and indicate crustal assimilation. Mingled clasts of light and dark glass were found to have microlites present in the dark glass, but were absent in the light glass. Electron microprobe analyses found that the dark and light glass components in a single clast had similar compositions, showing that the contrasting physical appearance of the glass is not due to a different chemical composition. Forty three whole rock XRF analyses showed that the magmas ranged from basaltic andesite to andesite, and Harker variation plots display linear trends typical of magma mixing. Magma mixing as the most important magmatic process is supported by disequilibrium of phenocryst compositions and phenocryst textures. Magma viscosity, bulk density and temperature was determined using MAGMA (Kware), and indicate that they fall into the range of typical andesites. Eruptive activity involved vigorous lava-fountaining, minor convecting eruption plumes and dominant collapsing eruption plumes. This activity has produced welded and non-welded pyroclastic flow and fall deposits to form the large cone seen today. There are significant volcanic hazards associated with this style of activity at North Crater, characterised by lava-fountaining, eruption plume fallout, and widespread pyroclastic flows and lahars extending beyond the ring plain. These could all be potentially devastating to the central North Island of New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tongariro Volcano</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">andesite</field><field name="subject">lava-fountain</field><field name="subject">welded deposits</field><field name="subject">pyroclastic flow</field><field name="subject">magma mingling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bacterial Community Analysis of Meat Industry Conveyor Belts</field><field name="creator">Mills, John</field><field name="description">At the commencement of this study, some sensitive overseas markets were rejecting chilled vacuum-packed New Zealand lamb due to higher than expected total viable counts, and counts of Enterobacteriaceae, a family of bacteria used to indicate sanitary condition. Of the many factors that influence the bacterial composition of chilled lamb in the overseas marketplace, the meat producer can only exert significant control over: Hygiene, ensuring the bacterial viable count on the meat prior to packaging is as low as possible, and comprised of as few species as possible that are capable of anaerobic growth at chilled meat temperatures. Maintaining the pH of the meat within acceptable limits, by careful animal selection and minimal pre-slaughter stress. Refrigeration temperatures, through rigorous maintenance of the cold-chain. The type of preservative packaging used, which is often limited by regulation in the marketplace. Initial work established that the bacterial microbiota present on the meat contact surfaces in the butchering facilities at some premises, in particular conveyor belting, was excessive and comprised of species that contributed to the high counts on the meat reported above. As a means of improving the hygiene of this process, this study investigated the hypothesis that some species of bacteria were able to form biofilms on the conveyor belt contact surfaces, becoming reservoirs for cross-contamination. This hypothesis was not been proven by this work; the results showing that biofilms were not present and that adequate hygiene of these surfaces instead depends on the ability to remove all meat-based residues from them at the completion of each day's processing. For premises operating interlocking belts from one manufacturer (Intraloxreg), a clean-in-place system is now available that is able to achieve this. Premises operating conventional disinfectant and water sanitisation of either continuous or interlocking belts must ensure that meat residue is completely removed before disinfection. The majority of New Zealand meat industry premises can now demonstrate that their hygienic processes in this area are under control. The microbiota of conveyor belting in this study was found to consist of bacteria from five taxonomic groups; the Flavobacteriaceae, the Actinomycetales, the Bacillus/Clostridium group, and the alpha and gamma branches of the Proteobacteria. The genera present on belts from premises whose hygiene was found to be in control did not contain species known to cause food-borne disease or spoilage of vacuum packaged meats. The bacterial viable count remains the most effective method available at this time for monitoring conveyor belt hygiene. Attempts to develop a monitoring system based on microscopy of an in-situ sampling device were unsuccessful due to an inability to penetrate the meat residue matrix.

The observed influence of the experimental conditions upon the extent of phosphate adsorption to various iron phases shows a considerable quantity of phosphorus is present in the reducible phase and in the residual mineral phase. The phosphorus associated with iron(III) oxide phases was released into solution under reducing conditions when ferric iron oxide/oxyhydroxides, including amorphous and poorly crystalline Fe(III) phases, were solubilized. The residual primary and secondary mineral phases remained stable in the sediments until they were exposed to extremely acidic media analogous to strongly reducing conditions. Manganese is not involved in phosphorus retention to the same extent as iron. Aluminium phases present were released from surface complexes with relative ease and also from mineral structures under the prevailing conditions. The results show a strong agreement between aluminium and phosphorus suggesting it is associated with various aluminium phases to some extent. The sediments of Lake Rotorua are rich in organic-bound P which is released when organic material is oxidized under conditions analogous to anaerobic degradation. The degradation of refractory organic material represents a significant source of phosphorus for incorporation into diagenetic minerals forming in oxic and anoxic layers of the sediment. Heavy liquid separation of the sediments concentrated the small quantities of dense minerals into a separate fraction and the presence of iron sulfides could be verified. Three density fractions obtained by this method separated the diatoms (d less than 2.6 g cm-3), the silicates (d greater than 2.6 less than 3.7 g cm-3) and the heavy minerals (d greater than 3.7 g cm-3) present in the sediment sample. In the heavy mineral phase spherulitic framboidal pyrite and rhombohedrial siderite were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis of the framboidal pyrite detected significant fluorescence's for sulphur and iron. The elemental analysis of siderite characterised it as an iron-rich, non-sulfidic particle with no phosphorus fluorescence. Particles were also observed that had a variable morphology to the framboidal pyrite minerals but similar ratio of Fe to S in the XRF spectrum. It is likely they are other stable forms of iron sulfides or pyrites in various stages of diagenetic dissolution. Digestion of the three density fractions shows the heavy mineral phase is significantly enriched in sulfur and in iron confirming the presence of sulfides. The sulfide-forming trace metals are concentrating in the heavy mineral phase but a progressive enrichment of trace metals down core is not found in the results. Many of the trace elements show maximum concentrations in the Tarawera tephra. There is a good agreement between iron and phosphorus in both treatments that implies iron phases are the predominant phosphorus fixers in the sediments of Lake Rotorua. However the identity of the phosphorus sink could not be confirmed by SEM or XRF analysis of the heavy minerals. The most likely explanations for the observed concentrations of iron and phosphorus and enrichment in the heavy mineral fraction are the persistence of the highly insoluble crystalline iron oxyhydroxides (goethite) in reducing sediments or the formation of the reduced iron mineral vivianite. Considering the density of vivianite it would have being taken into the heavy fraction by default which would account for the enrichment demonstrated by the solution analysis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sediments</field><field name="subject">phosphate</field><field name="subject">diagenesis</field><field name="subject">ferrous wheel</field><field name="subject">iron minerals</field><field name="subject">sequential extraction</field><field name="subject">density separation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cult on the rise? Students' perspectives on cult issues in secondary and national high schools in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Drawii, Judy Tatu</field><field name="description">In the last five years there has been a dramatic increase in perceived levels of antisocial behaviour amongst students in Secondary and National High schools in Papua New Guinea. Certain events have caught the public's attention, such as the burning down of school buildings and reports of Satanic worship. Despite widespread concern, there seems to be little understanding of why such problems are occurring and no systematic studies to estimate the exact extent of such behaviours or their underlying cause. The main objective of this study was to collect information about the students' perspectives on the nature and extent of these perceived problems. For ethical reasons, and with regard to ease of access to participants within the time frame of the study, data were collected from the first year student teachers at Madang Teachers' College, Papua New Guinea, who had been Secondary/National High school students only a few months previously. As this was an exploratory investigation, and it was not known whether participants would feel more at ease talking one-on-one with the researcher or in groups, two methodologies were used: focus group discussions and individual interviews. The research was conducted over a period of three weeks in June 2007, and involved a total of 21 participants (three focus groups of five, five and six people respectively, and six individual interviewees, one of whom also joined a group). The main findings to emerge from these discussions were as follows. First, the participants explained their own and other students' behaviour in terms of exploring old and new traditions of school life. Second, although several participants reported knowledge of supernatural practices, many of the group activities described in the discussions were normal activities among peer cliques that provided a sense of belonging and positive support for school achievement. There were no major differences in the stories told by male and female participants, and no obvious differences in the type of information provided under different research conditions. There was some disagreement among participants as to whether or not school authorities should take strong action to eliminate the possibility of cult practices. The findings are interpreted with reference to both Western psychological ideas about the nature of adolescence, and to local traditions, practices, and understandings of lifespan development. In particular, the notion of 'searching for identity' stands out in these accounts of student behaviour. This was an exploratory study and not designed to yield results that provide an overall picture of the situation in the Secondary/National High schools of Papua New Guinea. Nevertheless, participants' reports did relate to events experienced in the majority of PNG Secondary and National High schools, and some recommendations are tentatively offered.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cult issues</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">secondary schools</field><field name="subject">national high schools</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Affective commitment and citizenship behaviour: The role of LMX and personality and the mediating effects of empowerment</field><field name="creator">Rodriguez-Llewell, Yanahina</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to identify motivational factors that would predict organisational commitment and citizenship behaviour. One important motivational factor is empowerment, which is an intrinsic motivator (Spreitzer, 1995, p. 121 table 5 ), this study examined the contribution of each of its four dimensions  in predicting affective commitment and citizenship behaviours targeted towards both individuals and the organisation. I also investigated the association that leader-member exchange and three personality factors (extraversion, emotional stability and openness to experience) had with both empowerment and organisational outcomes (affective commitment, citizenship behaviours). I further examined empowerment mediation effects. This research was conducted among ten occupational groups at The Waikato District Health Board in New Zealand. 872 questionnaires were distributed and a final sample of 306 responses (35.1%) was obtained. The results, consistent across all occupational groups and other demographics, suggested that although extraversion, emotional stability and openness to experience individually contributed to empowerment, affective commitment and citizenship behaviours, when their contribution towards affective commitment and citizenship behaviour was examined simultaneously with empowerment and LMX contributions, personality contribution decreased. The regression equation results showed emotional stability as the only significant personality contributor towards citizenship behaviours. In addition, leader member exchange contribution was significant only towards affective commitment whereas empowerment was the strongest predictor of the three organisational outcomes explored. Moreover, two of the four empowerment dimensions were also found to mediate the relationship between LMX and affective commitment. However, no empowerment mediation effects were found between LMX and citizenship behaviours. Overall, this research provides valuable information on how to increase employee's affective commitment and extra role behaviours by adjusting organisation's structures and policies and fostering employees' perception of empowerment. Recommendations for further research and practical implications for organisations are discussed in the final chapter.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organisational commitment</field><field name="subject">citizenship behaviour</field><field name="subject">LMX leader member exchange</field><field name="subject">empowerment</field><field name="subject">empowerment meaning</field><field name="subject">empowerment competence</field><field name="subject">empowerment self determination</field><field name="subject">empowerment impact</field><field name="subject">personality</field><field name="subject">extraversion</field><field name="subject">emotional stability</field><field name="subject">openness to experience</field><field name="subject">engagement</field><field name="subject">motivation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using the Internet to Enhance Teaching at The University of Waikato</field><field name="creator">Dewstow, Ross Albert</field><field name="description">The University of Waikato brought the Internet to New Zealand, was one of the first Universities in New Zealand to graduate students who had completed a bachelor's degree online, and recently won an award for innovative use of video software in an online classroom. The video software was created by a company that had its beginnings within the University. However, the use of the Internet for teaching and learning in the University has reached a plateau in the last few years, as measured by the daily page views of the online platform (Moodie, 2004), the number of courses taught online and staff teaching online remaining fairly constant. This thesis sets out to investigate why the use of online teaching at the University has not increased to a point where a majority of staff are using online teaching to at least supplement their classroom teaching. Previous research into online teaching and learning focused heavily on technology barriers and lack of access to computers and the Internet. It is the position of the researcher that this lack of access is no longer a valid reason for academics not to use online environments for teaching and learning in a tertiary environment. This study hypothesized that enhancing their teaching using online technologies may be related to the culture of different subjects, disciplines and Schools of study. Accordingly three groups of lecturers from different Schools within the University were invited to participate in focus group interviews. Questions asked were related to their approach to teaching in their subject areas, the culture of their Schools and the University, as well as their reflections on teaching online.  The study found that there was a strong relationship between the use of online technologies and subject areas as well as the culture that exists within the School of study. The influence of University management on the use of online technologies was also highlighted. But more surprising was the relationship between trained teachers in the University, and their uptake and use of online technologies. To take advantage of the changing student population, with their greater awareness and use of computing and new technologies, the University of Waikato, and indeed many other similar institutions, are now at a technological and educational crossroad. Decisions need to be made by senior management regarding the importance of the Internet and emerging media technologies in shaping the teaching and learning environment of tomorrow's University.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">e-learning</field><field name="subject">online learning</field><field name="subject">teaching and learning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cultural Conversations in a Counselling Context</field><field name="creator">Harkness, Jane</field><field name="description">This research project focuses on counselling practice with M&#257;ori women who have engaged in counselling in relation to overcoming the effects of both historic and recent sexual abuse.

During muscle growth and regeneration satellite cells are activated in response to growth signals from the environment, which induces the expression of one or both of the two MRFs, Myf-5 or MyoD. Activated satellite cells migrate to the site of injury and proliferate before these transcription factors go on to activate transcription of myogenic genes. The myoblasts can then adopt one of two fates. Some myoblasts initiate terminal differentiation and are able to either fuse into existing myofibres to repair them, or fuse with other myoblasts to form new fibres. Other myoblasts do not differentiate but instead return to quiescence and adopt a satellite cell position on repaired or newly formed fibres.  Mighty, a downstream target of myostatin that was discovered by the Functional Muscle Genomics Laboratory has recently been shown to induce cell hypertrophy in cell culture through enhanced differentiation and fusion of myoblasts. Myostatin-null mice have hypertrophic muscles and an improved muscle regeneration phenotype. These mice have also been shown to have higher basal levels of Mighty in skeletal muscle than wild-type mice. In this thesis the expression profile of Mighty during skeletal muscle regeneration was characterised in relation to MyoD. During regeneration Mighty gene expression was induced at day five post-injury in both wild-type and myostatin-null mice. In the myostatin-null mice Mighty gene expression remained elevated at day seven post injury in contrast to the levels in the wild-type, which had decreased at this time point. By day-14 and day-28 post-injury Mighty levels were decreased. The up-regulation of Mighty occurs at the time of peak myotube formation in regenerating skeletal muscle, consistent with a role for Mighty in enhancing differentiation and fusion of myoblasts. The extended up-regulation of Mighty in the myostatin-null muscle may be responsible for the enhanced regeneration phenotype of these mice.  Analysis of the myotube and reserve cell populations, which are an in vitro model of satellite cells, from both C2C12 cells and Mighty over-expressing clones (Clone 7 and Clone 11) showed that Mighty expression down-regulates two satellite cell markers, CD34 and Sca-1. Both these molecules have been recently shown to be involved in myoblast fusion and reserve cell specification, although their exact role in these processes is not yet known. Expression of Sca-1 is associated with a slowly proliferating non-dividing state while CD34 is associated with the population of reserve cells that do not fuse when notch signalling is inhibited. The results of this thesis indicate that Mighty over-expression may cause the enhanced fusion phenotype by regulating these two molecules.  In conclusion the data in this thesis supports a role for Mighty in the myotube formation phase of regeneration and may be able to enhance regeneration by recruiting more myoblasts to terminal differentiation by altering CD34 and    Sca-1 expression.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">skeletal muscle</field><field name="subject">regeneration</field><field name="subject">Mighty</field><field name="subject">Sca-1</field><field name="subject">CD34</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The vulnerability of tongatapu coastal zone to local impacts of climate and sea level rise related risks</field><field name="creator">Lao, Fine Faitehina Tutu'u</field><field name="description">Tongatapu coastal zone vulnerability assessment study was conducted to examine the degree of current and future risks of projected climate change and sea level rise on the coastal zone of the main island of the Kingdom of Tonga-Tongatapu. Inundation, and flooding hazards generated by tropical cyclone storm surges are the common threats to Tongatapu coastal towns and villages because of their low-lying settings. Flooding problems are exacerbated by the social trends of population growth and migration from the outer islands of the Kingdom, to Tongatapu the main island where the capital town of the Kingdom, Nuku'alofa is located. Other threats include beach erosion, saltwater intrusion, and seawater spraying of coastal vegetations and properties. A survey of the local people of Tongatapu, mapping of vulnerable areas with GIS, and using my local knowledge of the island coastal zone were the three methods were used to conduct this study. The main objective of this research was to assess the vulnerability of the coastal zone of Tongatapu to local impacts of inundation and flooding hazards associated with climate and sea-level rise related risks. The results of the survey indicated that more than 95% of the respondents agreed that the coastal zone of Tongatapu is vulnerable to inundation and flooding risks generated by tropical cyclones that visit Tongatapu coastal water every year, based on their recollection, knowledge, and experienced of the past storm events that hit Tongatapu. GIS work showed that those coastal towns and villages of Tongatapu that are located in areas less than 5 meter above sea level are vulnerable to the local impacts of inundation and flooding hazards. It is concluded that the yearly visited tropical cyclones to Tonga that are actually hit Tongatapu coastal zone had increasing the vulnerability of the coastal towns and villages of Tongatapu that are located in areas below 5 meters above sea level to inundation and flooding hazards associated with climate change and sea level rise related risks. Other possible cause might be the gradual uplifted of the south coast of Tongatapu due to ongoing earthquake activities in Tonga since the last 200 years. But in facts more research it has to be done to confirm this argument. The response to the local impacts of inundation and flooding hazards in the coastal zone of Tongatapu should be focused on adaptation, risk and hazard management.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Climate change</field><field name="subject">sea level rise</field><field name="subject">vulnerability</field><field name="subject">coastal zone</field><field name="subject">Tongatapu</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diversity or Perversity? Investigating Queer Narratives, Resistance, and Representation in Aotearoa / New Zealand, 1948-2000</field><field name="creator">Burke, Christopher J. F.</field><field name="description">This thesis contributes to the burgeoning field of the history of sexuality in New Zealand and seeks to distill the more theorised and reflexive understanding of the subjectively understood queer male identity since 1948. Emerging from the disciplines of History and English, this project draws from a range of narratological materials: parliamentary debates contained in Hansard, and novels and short stories written by men with publicly avowed queer identities. This thesis explores how both 'normative' identity and the category of 'the homosexual' were constructed and mobilised in the public domain, in this case, the House of Representatives. It shows that members of the House have engaged with an extensive tradition of defining and excluding; a process by which state and public discourses have constructed largely unified, negative and othering narratives of 'the homosexual'. This constitutes an overarching narrative of queer experience which, until the mid-1990s, excluded queer subjects from its construction. At the same time, fictional narratives offer an adjacent body of knowledge and thought for queer men and women. This thesis posits literature's position as an important and productive space for queer resistance and critique. Such texts typically engage with and subvert 'dominant' or 'normative' understandings of sexuality and disturb efforts to apprehend precise or linear histories of 'gay liberation' and 'gay consciousness'. Drawing from the works of Frank Sargeson, James Courage, Bill Pearson, Noel Virtue, Stevan Eldred-Grigg, and Peter Wells, this thesis argues for a revaluing of fictional narratives as active texts from which historians can construct a matrix of cultural experience, while allowing for, and explaining, the determining role such narratives play in the discursively constructed understandings of gender and sexuality in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">queer</field><field name="subject">homosexual</field><field name="subject">homosexuality</field><field name="subject">gay</field><field name="subject">queer theory</field><field name="subject">cultural history</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">novels</field><field name="subject">narrative</field><field name="subject">parliamentary debates</field><field name="subject">Hansard</field><field name="subject">House of Representatives</field><field name="subject">Frank Sargeson</field><field name="subject">James Courage</field><field name="subject">Bill Pearson</field><field name="subject">Noel Virtue</field><field name="subject">Stevan Eldred-Grigg</field><field name="subject">Peter Wells</field><field name="subject">politicians</field><field name="subject">members of parliament</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Aotearoa</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Service for Audio Icon and Audio Books in the Mobile Tourist Information System (TIP) via the Greenstone Digital Library</field><field name="creator">Gao, Xin</field><field name="description">This project provides an audio notification about nearby tourism place to visit (named sight in this thesis), a chapter based Audio Books related to the current sight and involving Digital Library to provide text for the Audio Books for the Tourist Information Provider on a mobile device (TIP).

Low-lying coastal communities in particular are vulnerable to a range of natural hazards including coastal erosion, storm surge inundation, tsunami and water safety that come with varying levels of risk to life and property. New Zealand's coastal hazard monitoring network is patchy and resources are limited. As a consequence there is considerable potential for coastal communities are going to need to take a more active role in monitoring their environment and building data bases and knowledge that can be used to better manage their coast. This paper describes simple methodologies based on the needs of various community groups and sound science principles that can be used to monitor beaches and the coastal environment. By employing these tools councils, technical experts and community groups will be able to make better-informed decisions for managing activities in the coastal environment. One of the keys to the successful uptake of a monitoring programme by a community group is its relevance to the group. The programme and the tools provided must fit the interests, needs, capability and resources of the group. This project develops tools for coastal monitoring and targets coastal community groups such as Coast Care, Coastal Hapu, Secondary Schools, and Surf Life Saving Clubs. The monitoring methodologies have been developed in consultation with Tainui ki Whaingaroa hapu, Raglan Area School, and the Waikato Beach Care and Coast Care Bay of Plenty. Successful methodologies for measuring changes on the coast are also those that are matched to the type of beach, use appropriate equipment, collect structured data, provide data to which analysis can be applied, incorporate local knowledge of the environment, and feed results back to the community and other interested parties such as councils and science organisations. This project provides the target groups with simple monitoring methodologies, field forms/checklists, and appropriate survey and measurement equipment (which have undergone field trials) to carry out coastal monitoring.  A web-based facility has been developed to input, check and store data; and provide immediate feedback using graphs and images. It also provides background information on coastal processes relevant to monitoring programmes.  In this manner, a scientifically robust data set is collected and stored within a secure and future proofed archive, providing valuable information to coastal groups for years to come. Although the primary objective of this research is to develop a means for coastal communities to monitor changes in their environment, there are additional benefits associated with engaging communities in the study of their environment. These benefits include increasing awareness of coastal hazards, capacity building, providing valuable educational resources, and improving the temporal and spatial data coverage of information for the New Zealand coastline.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Science</field><field name="subject">Monitoring Tools</field><field name="subject">Coastal</field><field name="subject">Environmental</field><field name="subject">Community</field><field name="subject">coastal management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Breakdown of Skeletal Muscle in Dairy Cows During Peak Lactation</field><field name="creator">Gray, Tarra Stacee</field><field name="description">The decline in fertility in dairy cows is of international concern. Since 1950, milk production demands have increased while first service rates of conception have decreased. It is unclear why fertility has decreased, however current dairy management practice requires cows to be kept on a tight yearly calving schedule to ensure maximum milk production over the lifetime of the cow. The current postulate suggests that this regime places a high metabolic burden on the cows, which in turn requires the breakdown of tissues such as fat and muscle to provide substrates to meet the increased energy demands of lactation.  Immediately after calving, dairy cows enter a state of negative energy balance (EB), as they cannot consume enough energy to sustain lactation. During this period of negative EB, fat is mobilised in the form of non-esterified fatty acids to help supply the body with the extra energy it needs, but fat mobilisation decreases after four weeks while cows remain in a state of negative EB for several more weeks. It is unclear whether or not muscle breakdown occurs and plays a role in the restoration of EB in lactating cows during peak lactation. I hypothesized that the breakdown of muscle does occur in cows during peak lactation, and that it occurs to a greater extent in cows producing higher amounts of milk.  Dairy cows from three strains, NZL, NZH and OSH, representing cows with differing milk production abilities (low, intermediate and high, respectively), were studied for 12 weeks postpartum. Blood was drawn at weekly intervals and muscle biopsies taken at -1, 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks postpartum.  Analysis of plasma revealed an increase in the abundance of troponin I-fs (a marker of muscle breakdown) over the period of study, suggesting that breakdown of skeletal muscle was occurring. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that expression of the ubiquitin-proteasome (UbP) ligases atrogin-1 (atro1) and muscle ring finger protein 1 (murf1) increased initially, but returned to normal levels by four weeks postpartum. Concentration of mRNA of the lysosomal proteases, cathepsin B, D, H and L, did not change over the period of study. Therefore, the UbP pathway may contribute to the breakdown of muscle detected by troponin I-fs in plasma.  Proteins involved in translation initiation were examined by Western blotting. The ratio of phosphorylated over total eIF2alpha and 4E-BP1 remained unchanged throughout the study, indicating that the breakdown of muscle was not a result of decreased protein synthesis. However, there was a greater ratio of phosphorylated to total eIF2alpha in NZL cows compared with NZH and OSH, suggesting that protein synthesis was less overall in NZL cows than other strains. Measurement of myosin heavy chain composition indicated there was no change in the abundance of type I and type IIx muscle fibres and plasma myostatin levels did not change over the period of study. However, the OSH cows had less myostatin in their plasma than the NZL and NZH cows, suggesting that there may be inhibition of muscle growth occurring in this strain.  The results of this study suggest that breakdown of muscle could be important in restoring the EB in high-producing dairy cows during peak lactation. Upregulation of the UbP pathway during the first four weeks of lactation may contribute to this muscle breakdown. However, it remains unclear what processes then continue to regulate breakdown of skeletal muscle to maintain the elevated abundance of troponin I-fs in plasma from four to 12 weeks postpartum in lactating dairy cows.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dairy cows</field><field name="subject">lactation</field><field name="subject">breakdown of skeletal muscle</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beginning primary teachers' induction and mentoring practices in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Deruage, Joseph Kua</field><field name="description">Professional development of beginning teachers through induction and mentoring has been commonly viewed as important for teachers' success and continuation in the teaching profession. Induction and specifically mentoring programs focus attention on transitions from one stage of teacher development to another. The three phases of teacher development are initial teacher education, known as pre-service, the induction phase and the ongoing teacher in-service education. The move from student to teacher is the most demanding change in learning to teach. The beginning teacher in this change must adjust from thinking and acting as a student, absorbed with his or her own learning and performance, to thinking and acting as a teacher, accepting responsibility for the learning and performance of others. Beginning teachers are fully engaged in this essential development, and mentoring programs are purposely intended to support them through this period of change. This study has established that beginning teachers in Papua New Guinea (PNG) do experience challenges in the first few months of teaching but these issues lapse over time with the support and assistance of mentors/supervisors. Mentoring has great potential for group effort and transformational teacher learning within schools as professional learning communities. In order for mentors to perform their tasks well and draw benefits from mentoring, appropriate support and training for mentors is recommended. As well as support and training, other incentives for mentors such as salary increments and reduced teaching loads would be a welcome step to enhancing induction and mentoring programs in PNG primary schools.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teacher education</field><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="subject">beginning teacher induction</field><field name="subject">mentors and mentoring practices</field><field name="subject">primary school teachers in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">teacher registration and certification</field><field name="subject">teacher development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Winter Leaf Yellowing in 'Hass' Avocado</field><field name="creator">Mandemaker, Andries Jan</field><field name="description">The New Zealand avocado industry is worth $39.7 million in exports of 'Hass' avocados.  Crop yields grew steadily from 1996 to 2001 to reach an average of 8.86 tonnes/ha.  Since then however, crop yields have remained steady.  To increase returns to growers, crop yields must increase.  Avocado leaves in New Zealand become yellow in winter and it is hypothesised that chilling, followed by photoinhibition, is leading to photooxidation.  Leaf yellowing leads to reduced photosynthetic capacity and early leaf abscission, at a time when carbon fixation and carbohydrate reserves are needed to support developing flowers, subsequent fruit set and vegetative flush, in addition to the existing mature crop.  The focus of this research was to determine the underlying causes of yellowing in 'Hass' avocado leaves during winter.  It is suspected that it is a result of the creation of free-radical oxygen that causes photooxidation of leaf components under excess light during low temperature conditions, such as experienced on clear winter mornings in the Bay of Plenty.  An orchard in Katikati, in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand was selected has it had a history of leaf yellowing.  Two open flow, differential gas exchange measurement systems, The CIRAS-1 and the CMS-400 were used to monitor leaf photosynthetic performance over the course of the 2006 winter, with particular focus on the month of August.  Chlorophyll a fluorescence was measured with a Walz Mini-PAM, leaf colour with a Minolta Chroma meter CR-200b and chlorophyll content with Minolta SPAD chlorophyll meter (in addition to traditional extraction techniques).  There was conclusive evidence that the cold nights resulted in decreased net photosynthesis over the winter, with the depression starting in May and ending around the middle of August, dates that coincide closely with the period when days with mean temperatures less than 10 C occurred.  The decrease in photosynthesis appears to be due to a direct effect on the carbon reduction pathway and in unusual in that full recovery seems to occur at the same time during the day. No photodamage of significance was found and the avocado seems to be highly protected against high light when photosynthesis is inhibited.  This investigation found that leaf yellowing is not caused by photodamage following depressed photosynthesis.  A new hypothesis is proposed which suggests that leaf yellowing is produced by the re-allocation of nitrogen  from leaves during cold weather during flowering.  It is suggested that the chilled leaves are seen as unproductive, old or shaded leaves by the plant and nutrient resources are re-allocated away from these leaves.  A foliar application of 1% low biuret urea and 0.5% magnesium sulphate is currently used by avocado growers to restore leaf colour in leaves that have become yellow over winter.  An experiment was carried out on yellowed leaves on 23rd August 2006 to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.  This study concluded that the treatment was able to restore some leaf colour, but had no effect on leaf photosynthetic function.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Persea americana</field><field name="subject">photoinhibition</field><field name="subject">photooxidation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a Theory of Postmodern Humour: South Park as carnivalesque postmodern narrative impulse</field><field name="creator">Franklyn, Blair Scott</field><field name="description">The philosopher Martin Heidegger describes humour as a response to human 'thrownness' in the world.  This thesis argues that there is a form of humour which can be usefully described as postmodern humour and that postmodern humour reflects the experience of being 'thrown' into postmodernity.  Postmodern humour responds to and references the fears, fixations, frameworks and technologies which underpin our postmodern existence.  It is further contended that South Park is an example of postmodern humour in the way that it exhibits a carnivalesque postmodern narrative impulse which attacks the meta-narrative style explanations of contemporary events, trends and fashions offered in the popular media. South Park's carnivalesque humour is a complex critique on a society in which television is a primary instrument of communication, a centre-piece to many people's lives, and a barometer of contemporary culture, while at the same time drawing attention to the fact that the medium being satirised is also used to perform the critique.  A large portion of this thesis is devoted to examining and interrogating the discursive properties of humour as compared to seriousness, an endeavour which also establishes some interesting links to postmodern philosophical discourse.  This can be succinctly summarized by the following: 1.	Humour is a form of discourse which simultaneously refers to two frames of reference, or associative contexts.  Therefore humour is a bissociative form of discourse. 2.	Seriousness is a form of discourse which relies on a singular associative context. 3.	The legally and socially instituted rules which govern everyday life use serious discourse as a matter of practical necessity.  4.	Ambiguity, transgression and deviancy are problematic to serious discourse (and therefore the official culture in which it circulates), but conventions of humorous discourse. 5.	Humorous discourse then, challenges the singularity and totality of the official discourses which govern everyday life.  Subsequently, humour has been subjected to a variety of controls, most notably the 'policing the body' documented in the writings of Norbert Elias and Michel Foucault.   6.	Humour can therefore be understood to function in a manner similar to Jean-Fran ois Lyotard's concept of little-narrative's, which destabilize the totality of official meta-narratives. Furthermore, this thesis proposes strong links between the oppositional practices of the medieval carnival, as outlined by Mikhail Bakhtin, and the produced-for-mass-consumption humour of South Park.  However, it also demonstrates that although South Park embodies the oppositional spirit of the carnival, it lacks its fundamentally social nature, and therefore lacks its politically resistant potency.  More specifically it is argued that the development and prevalence of technologies such as television, video/DVD, and the internet, allows us to access humour at any time we wish. However, this temporal freedom is contrasted by the spatial constraints inherent in these communication/media technologies.  Rather than officially sanctioned times and places for carnivalesque social gatherings, today, individuals have the 'liberty' of free (private) access to carnivalesque media texts, which simultaneously help to restrict the freedom of social contact that the carnival used to afford.  Further to this, it is argued that the fact that South Park, with its explicit derision of authority, is allowed to circulate through mainstream media at all, implies asymmetric conservative action on the part of officialdom.  In this sense it is argued that postmodern humour such as South Park is allowed to circulate because the act of watching/consuming the programme also acts as a deterrent to actual radical activity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">South Park</field><field name="subject">Humour</field><field name="subject">Postmodernism</field><field name="subject">Carnivalesque</field><field name="subject">Discourse</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterizing the Catalytic Action of &#956;-Calpain on Myofibrillar Protein Structure</field><field name="creator">Fraser-Smith, Emma Louise</field><field name="description">Solving the problem of inconsistent meat tenderness is a top priority of the meat industry. This requires a greater understanding of the processes that affect meat tenderness and the adoption of such information by the meat industry. It is essential that we understand the mechanism of meat tenderisation of which, the calpain protease system is believed to play a central role. This thesis focuses on three aspects; characterisation of calpain activity, the effect of porcine &#956;-calpain on myofibril degradation and the effect of &#956;-calpain on specific proteins desmin and troponin-T. To study the effect of calpain activity, fluorogenic assays were used to determine: &#956;-calpain concentration for optimal peptide cleavage; calcium requirements and the effect of chelating substances on the activity of &#956;-calpain. In addition, the affinity of &#956;-calpain for substrates CalS-I and CalS-III were assessed. The effect of &#956;-calpain on myofibril degradation was evaluated through the use of myofibrillar fragmentation index and density marker beads. Myofibrils were digested at three different temperatures for varying time periods. Conflicting results were displayed and it was concluded that these methods are not accurate, thus further research should be conducted to ensure inconsistencies are eliminated. Specific proteins desmin and troponin-T have previously been shown to exhibit degradation in the presence of calcium and &#956;-calpain. SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, western blotting and densitometry measurements were utilized to investigate this effect. It was concluded that &#956;-calpain plays a significant role in the post mortem proteolysis of myofibrillar protein. This thesis provides information and strives to give a better understanding of the proteolytic changes that occur within muscle. Understanding how these mechanisms affect meat on a cellular level, can help to control the influence they inflict on meat quality.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Calpain</field><field name="subject">proteolysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative proteomics approach to studying skeletal muscle mitochondria from myostatin knockout mice</field><field name="creator">Puddick, Jonathan</field><field name="description">Myostatin is a negative regulator of muscle growth. When it is not present or non-functional double-muscling occurs, the primary characteristic of this phenotype being an increase in muscle mass. Another characteristic of double-muscling is an increased proportion of type IIB muscle fibres, which rely on glycolysis as their primary energy source, as opposed to type IIA and type I fibres which rely on oxidative phosphorylation. This switch in muscle metabolism directly impacts on the mitochondria, as mitochondria from glycolytic muscle fibres have been shown to have differences in metabolic activity. The increased proportion of glycolytic muscle fibres present in myostatin knockout animals provides a unique model to investigate alterations in muscle fibre type metabolism. The mouse model of myostatin knockout utilised during this study was generated by genetic deletion of exon three of the myostatin gene. Verification of this knockout was attempted by western blot analysis, but only the latency associated protein (LAP) was detected. Interestingly, the LAP was barely detectable in the knockout muscle suggesting deletion of exon three affects binding of anti-myostatin antibodies to the LAP, as that part of the gene is not deleted. A comparison of the basal mitochondrial stress levels was made, also by western blot analysis. The knockout mitochondria showed no change in levels of heat shock protein 60 or superoxide dismutase 2, indicating that they are not being subjected to any increased stress due to the myostatin knockout phenotype. A comparative proteomics approach was used to detect changes in the mitochondrial proteome of myostatin knockout gastrocnemius muscle to gain clues to how mitochondria from glycolytic muscle fibres differ from those present in oxidative fibres. This was undertaken using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), in-gel tryptic digests and peptide mass fingerprinting by mass spectrometry. A 2-DE gel protein loading of 220 g was shown to give the best protein spot resolution and the most crucial step in the loading process was found to be the laying of the immobilized pH gradient, which had to be performed very carefully to obtain a consistent loading pattern. This study resolved only around 160 protein spots out of the estimated 1,000 to 2,000 proteins present in the mitochondria. Modulation of six proteins was seen at a plt0.1 level, but were unable to be identified using the current methodology. More abundant mitochondrial proteins were able to be identified, but showed no significant modulation. Malate dehydrogenase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which were identified during this study, have been reported to have decreased activity in mitochondria from glycolytic muscle fibres. This study suggests that the change in activity observed by other researchers is due to inhibition of these enzymes in the glycolytic fibres or activation in the oxidative fibres.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mitochondria</field><field name="subject">proteomics</field><field name="subject">myostatin</field><field name="subject">skeletal muscle</field><field name="subject">2-DE</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making Canons and Finding Flowers - A Study of Selected New Zealand Poetry Anthologies</field><field name="creator">Bullock, Owen Fred</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the poetry contained in anthologies published between the 1940s and 1980s in New Zealand and that of some later anthologies that retrospectively covered the same period. I wanted to find out what subject matter preoccupied poets during these times, to monitor changes in the content of that poetry and to observe what techniques were used and the evolution of styles. Complimentary to the study of the poetry is an evaluation of the intentions of the editors of the anthologies and how much their selections were directed by their tastes and knowledge to form a kind of 'construct', or representation of the publishing of poetry.  From my reading, I conjectured that the literary canon with regard to poetry was formed in New Zealand by the mid-1970s, on the strength of publications from Penguin and Oxford University Press. The 1945 and 1960 anthologies by Allen Curnow were extremely influential - particularly the second of these two - and the editors of future anthologies from the larger publishers diverged comparatively little from his choices. Curnow's anthologies are the subject of Chapter One, and in Chapter Two, I look at Vincent O'Sullivan's series of three anthologies for Oxford (1970, 1976 and 1987), which confirmed and expanded that canon.	However, from the mid-1960s, and especially in the early 1970s, new trends emerged in New Zealand writing, linked to a consciousness of post-modernist literary theory. Some of the new trends, together with material that supplemented existing perspectives on poetry, are discussed in Chapter Three. The greater degree of acknowledgement of writing by women poets - which began in the late 1960s in smaller literary journals - reached a point where the first anthology of women's poetry, Private Gardens, could be published in 1977. The first major anthology to be edited by a woman appeared five years later. The gradualness of these changes is stressed, however, with regard to women's poetry included in the larger anthologies themselves. A new bias emerged in the late 1970s and 1980s in favour of work from the University presses. Nevertheless, anthologies that presented some alternative point of view on our literary history proliferated at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Taken together, the anthologies Big Smoke and Real Fire form a more holistic picture of what went on in the 1960s and 1970s and are discussed in Chapter Four of this thesis. Concluding remarks focus on the prejudices that appear to have guided the publishing of poetry in New Zealand anthologies, the influence of major poets, and the possibilities for further study of this body of literature.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthologies</field><field name="subject">New Zealand poetry</field><field name="subject">New Zealand poets</field><field name="subject">poetry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">International Posture, L2 Motivation, and L2 Proficiency among South Korean Tertiary EFL Learners</field><field name="creator">Courtney, Matthew Gordon Ray</field><field name="description">Today, English is spoken by more non-native speakers than native speakers; current estimates by Graddol (2007) indicate five to one. With this transformation English has become the international language of business and intercultural communication. The emergence of English as Lingua Franca is apparent in Korean society where English plays a defining role in educational, career, social, cultural, and economic domains. Despite such inextricable links the acquisition of English in Korea has not been successful. This study examines the relationship between Korean university students' International Posture or  non-ethnocentric attitude  (Yashima, 2002, p. 57) and their L2 (Second Language) Learning Motivation, and L2 Proficiency in English, first described by Yashima (2002) in her study of Japanese EFL (English as a Foreign Language) tertiary students. The methodology used in this thesis was quantitative as it employed Likert scales in order to elicit students' International Posture, and L2 Motivation, and obtained L2 Proficiency from percentile grades in the TOEIC exam. With the use of path analysis software, AMOS 7, data from 118 university freshman (majoring in English literature) from Hannam University, South Korea were analyzed in order examine the relationship between International Posture, L2 Learning Motivation, and L2 Proficiency among South Korean EFL students. The results indicated a significant and very strong relationship between International Posture and L2 Learning Motivation and a significant and moderate relationship between L2 Learning Motivation and overall L2 Proficiency. The findings of the study conclude that EFL learner motivation can be understood by an agglomeration of integrative and instrumental motivational orientations. The findings in this study also suggest that the tendency for Korean EFL learners to approach, rather than avoid, interaction with people of different cultures is especially important to understanding Korean tertiary level students' attitude, motivation and performance in EFL. These findings could be implemented in the classroom by providing Korean EFL learners with safe and appropriate opportunities to interact with foreigners. Potential areas for further research include longitudinal studies (utilizing both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies) that look into the effect of EFL learner age, gender, and teaching pedagogy on International Posture, L2 Learning Motivation, and L2 Proficiency.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">International posture</field><field name="subject">attitude</field><field name="subject">L2 motivation</field><field name="subject">L2 proficiency</field><field name="subject">South Korea</field><field name="subject">East Asia</field><field name="subject">Confucianism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kaum tuatanga the changing roles of kaum tua in Ng ti Rehua: Future directions</field><field name="creator">Davies, Sydney Henare</field><field name="description">This study looks at the roles of kaum tua and investigates how these roles have changed over time.

The study was conducted with the assistance of members of one hapu (N=47) that were 65 years of age and over. The study was by interview, utilising a semi-structured questionnaire with both open ended and closed questions. Narratives from participants was analysed and compared to the roles of kaum tua that were found in the literature, namely; Leadership, cultural knowledge, dispute resolution, protection and nurturing of young, provide spiritual and other guidance, social control, provide rituals, preserve te reo M&#257;ori and live active and healthy lives. Findings of this research supported the roles found in the literature. The roles of kaum tua still exist but may have diminished over time.

Mastitis influences the quality of milk and therefore reduces financial returns to both the farmer and the processor. Early detection of mastitis typically reduces treatment cost and a significant amount of research has been done in this field. Currently, the three major methods for mastitis detection are: &#8226; The Foss Analysis, which physically counts each cell and is performed off-site. &#8226; The Whiteside Test, which is based on a direct relationship between the number of the blood cells and the intensity of a gel formed between NaOH and cells. It was developed for on-site mastitis detection, but is no longer used routinely. &#8226; The California Mastitis Test (CMT), which can be done on-site, but is only a quantitative indication of the severity of the infection. The California Mastitis Test has previously been adapted to determine the somatic cell count (SCC) in infected milk by correlating viscosity to cell count. Although highly successful, some uncertainty exists regarding the rheology of the gel formed during the test as well as factors that may influence the accuracy of the test. In this thesis, studies were undertaken on the rheology of the gel formed during the California Mastitis Test in order to develop an understanding of the mechanism of gel formation and how various factors influence the rheology of the gel. Basic biochemistry and physico-chemistry of the gel has been reviewed and it was found that the CMT gel is a DNA/histone/surfactant complex, which forms when SDS is introduced into infected milk with elevated somatic cell counts. Based on literature and some initial experimentation it was found that the gel is a time- and sheardependent, non-Newtonian fluid. Since the reliability of the CMT hinges on the correlation between viscosity and SCC, this study investigated specific factors that may influence gelation, these were: iii &#8226; rheology &#8226; testing conditions, such as time delay prior to viscosity testing, shear rate and temperature &#8226; surfactant type and concentration &#8226; milk composition, including fat content, somatic cell count and protein content. It was found that when using capillary viscometry a linear relationship exists between the relative viscosity of the gel and the SCC. The surfactant concentration determines the slope of this linear relationship and it was found that at least 3% SDS is necessary for accurate results. Using more than 3% SDS resulted in more scatter in the data. It was also found that a linear relationship exists between the maximum apparent viscosity and SCC. Either capillary or Brookfield viscometry can be used, however, Brookfield viscometry was found to be more sensitive at the lower SCC range. It was found that the combination of surfactant concentration and SCC influenced the rheology of the gel. The lower the SCC the more SDS was required for gel formation. It was found that when using 1% SDS the critical SCC was 79 k cell/ml, while using 3% SDS this was lowered to 59 k cell/ml. It was found that above the critical SCC the gel is a non-Newtonian rheopectic fluid. Dependent on shear rate, the gel shows rheodestructive behaviour. With a delay time, the peak viscosity of the gel formed faster with longer delay times. However, more than 30 seconds delay had no additional influence on gel formation. It was found that the shear rate or spindle speed influences both the time to reach the peak viscosity as well as the magnitude of this maximum. Higher shear rates shortened the time to reach the maximum apparent viscosity as well as the maximum viscosity. This is likely due to physical breakdown of the gel which is accelerated due to increased shear. Different surfactants have different effects on raw milk. Both acetic acid and Triton- 114 were found to be ineffective as CMT reagents. Acetic acid only denatures proteins and the increased viscosity is due to the precipitation of casein. Triton-114 cannot lyse nuclei walls and therefore gel formation was prohibited due to no DNA/histone complexes being released. Mixing SDS with Triton-114 was found to be less effective than SDS alone either due to the nucleus not being lysed, or because iv of interaction effects between SDS and Triton-114, reducing the available SDS for gelation. Lastly it was concluded that protein and fat content only contributes to the viscosity of milk by changing the solids content of milk and neither of these affects gelation during the CMT. Also, temperature only has a small influence on the relative viscosity and this influence could be neglected if the CMT is done around room temperature.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mastitis</field><field name="subject">rheology</field><field name="subject">California Mastitis Test</field><field name="subject">gel</field><field name="subject">viscosity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internationalization of the Yarra Valley Wine Industry Cluster</field><field name="creator">Sedoglavich, Milan</field><field name="description">This research investigates the ways in which firms in the cluster approach the process of internationalization through exploring the influence of business clustering and how it benefits firms in entering foreign markets. The purpose was to understand this process to enable firms to develop successful international strategies to expand in foreign markets. The focus of the study is on the Yarra Valley Wine Industry Cluster, the oldest wine growing region in Victoria, Australia. This research examined of Australian wineries to join together in order to achieve greater competitiveness in collaboration when entering foreign markets due to ever increasing global competition. This paper was an exploratory study that used qualitative information gathered from the case study firms to provide practical framework for the execution of the research using a multiple-case study design. The findings show the following: first, some of the wineries gain their perceptions of the foreign markets from their relationships with, as well as, by the input and suggestions of the distributors, agents, and partners in a particular market, while others seem to distance themselves from their international environments and only focus on serving domestic/local markets exclusively. Second, personal networks play an important role when it comes to the internationalization process of the wineries because they provide access to market knowledge. Third, cooperation among cluster firms plays a very limited role in assisting wineries in foreign market expansion; it has only been of benefit when it came to dealing with local issues. The cluster has played only a minor role, if any, when it comes to the internationalization of the cluster firms. Clustering has been identified as a place where wineries exchange knowledge, and techniques, in regards to wine production, or come together in a joint effort to sort out local issues. However, the cluster does not provide assistance to individual wineries entering international marketplaces. In conclusion there was a distinctive lack of active support and organization from the cluster with regard to the international expansion due to the lack of leadership and joint direction among cluster members. This is where local government could take more proactive role to facilitate better usage of geographical clusters. The findings could improve the company decision-making process. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of clustering as a means for the future international expansion can be useful in helping to develop international strategies for firms. This would be of great significance to business practitioners because this may have a crucial impact on the competitive advantage of firms in foreign markets. In addition to having significant implications for practice, the investigation has implications for international business research because it provides a better understanding of the role of a cluster in the internationalization.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">internationalization process</field><field name="subject">clusters</field><field name="subject">SME</field><field name="subject">international strategies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How does Culture Impact on Educational Leadership in Samoa?</field><field name="creator">Faaulufalega, Tailetai Pale</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to explore the relationship between culture and the educational leadership of six secondary school principals in Samoa. Educational leadership is a bounded process and is subject to the cultural traditions and values of the society in which it is exercised. To date, no research has been undertaken on this topic in Samoa. This qualitative study used a semi-structured interview process to gather data from the secondary school principals who had been principals for more than three years in government schools. It also sought to explore how professional development of the principals might be undertaken. The principals in this study were interviewed both face-to-face and by telephone. The findings revealed that culture significantly impacted on their leadership. The matai culture was particularly influential. For example, respect, Christianity, role modelling and the importance of using the Samoan language to communicate within the school context were all influential. The findings also revealed the effective leadership styles applicable to Samoan school context in relation to indigenous cultural leadership. For example, inclusive/consensus/collaborative leadership style that is practiced in Samoan culture is effectively used by principals to lead schools. The organisational culture of the Ministry of Education Sports and Culture in Samoa (MESC) also considerably impacts on educational leadership. For example, the policies from the MESC sometimes contradict with the practice of the principals, such as the principal's practice of corporal punishment is a crime in the MESC and United Nation policies. This research also revealed the gap between the western models of leadership and the Samoan indigenous cultural context and leadership practice by the principals. Therefore, all the principals involved in this study positively engaged with their Samoan cultural values and beliefs to lead schools effectively. However some Samoan indigenous cultural values and beliefs impact negatively on the education system. They need to be considered so as not to inhibit the development of educational leadership of Samoan principals. Today's education has grown rapidly in terms of technology therefore educational leaders must adapt and change their leadership.

This is a challenging area; despite the trend for children to be exposed to computer technology at an earlier age, they often struggle to utilize it effectively. Children are not merely miniature adults; they have their own needs which are often not met by traditional software. In particular, this thesis focuses on the task of music management: a task that children take much interest in but for which they are given few tools. We address this with the design of a new music management system: the Kid's Music Box.  The development of Kid's Music Box is documented in four main parts: background research, requirements gathering, design and implementation, and evaluation. Background research identifies the strengths and weaknesses of conventional music organizers with respect to young users. Requirements gathering took the form of a focus group study, which aimed to overcome the distinct challenges of obtaining input from children. The design of Kid's Music Box builds on this work, by incorporating functionality, metaphors and design elements that suit the needs and capabilities of young children. Expert evaluations and formal evaluation from children users showed promising results, which concluded that Kid's Music Box is better than other organizers in terms of managing music for children.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Organizer</field><field name="subject">Children Software</field><field name="subject">Working with Children</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2261</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utilising the human dimensions of wildlife management approach to initiate an understanding of the ways in which New Zealanders value wildlife in Aotearoa, New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Cowie, Sarah Joanna</field><field name="description">This study was instigated by the lack of human dimensions research undertaken in New Zealand, and seeks to investigate the knowledge and values New Zealanders hold about New Zealand wildlife within three distinct groups of the New Zealand public. These groups were the Royal Forest and Bird Society of New Zealand Inc, the New Zealand Ecological Society (Inc.), and the New Zealand Deerstalkers Association. A questionnaire administered via Association list-serv's was utilised and a total of 52 questionnaires were completed by members of the three stakeholder groups. These were then analysed to investigate the values and knowledge New Zealanders hold toward wildlife in New Zealand.  The findings of this study suggest that New Zealander's hold strong utilitarian and negativistic values toward wildlife while the humanistic, moralistic, and naturalistic values were expressed by the majority of respondents. This result could be due to the high level of respondents who were from the New Zealand Deerstalkers Association. Conversely, whiled the data suggests that New Zealander's hold the ecologistic/scientific value only weakly, overall they have a high level of factual knowledge about wildlife. Because of this, it may be suggested that wildlife managers should generate education programmes that specifically address the negativistic value by making them imaginative and interesting.  Demographic factors were found to be influential in the ways in which New Zealander's value wildlife and the knowledge they hold although these were not as significant as indicated by studies undertaken in other countries. The lowest levels of knowledge were shown by respondents who were over 60 years of age; and higher income levels corresponded with the negativistic value being held more highly. Several areas of this study showed transgressions from other studies undertaken overseas. Unlike other studies, which suggested that females hold the naturalistic value more strongly than males, this study showed that both males and females held the naturalistic value only weakly. This indicates that findings from studies conducted overseas may not be transferable to the New Zealand situation and therefore, for New Zealand managers to effectively incorporate human dimensions information in decision-making processes, human dimensions research must be undertaken in the New Zealand context. Furthermore, wildlife managers should not make assumptions based on other studies and communities as these can lead to ineffective communication and implementation of wildlife management policies and education programmes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human dimensions</field><field name="subject">wildlife</field><field name="subject">wildlife management</field><field name="subject">values</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a map service</field><field name="creator">Huang, Xiaotie (Anthony)</field><field name="description">Geographic Information Systems (GIS) a computerized mapping system for capturing, storing, retrieving, analysing, and displaying spatial data (the type of data that has a geographic location).

The attraction of the MIPs technology is the ease of creating binding elements which are relatively cheap compared with the process of isolating natural antibodies.  In this research monoterpenes, such as &#945;-terpineol, were chosen to be the model compounds for investigating the molecular imprinting of small, poorly functionalised organic compounds.  The conventional non-covalent approach was mainly used to synthesise these MIPs, but the sacrificial-spacer semi-covalent approach was also investigated.  A less widely used method, porogen-imprinting - a variant of non-covalent imprinting - was adapted for &#945;-terpineol.  The latter novel terpene MIP appeared to specifically bind &#945;-terpineol, by hydrogen bonding, so the polymer was characterised in detail.  The main parameters which were altered for preparing non-covalent MIPs included the template (&#945;-terpineol, (-)-menthol or trans-terpin); the functional monomer (methacrylic acid, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, bilirubin and phenol [for the semi-covalent MIP]); the cross-linking monomer (ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, divinylbenzene and trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate); and also the polymerisation method (block or precipitation polymerisation).  The binding specificity and cross-reactivity for all the polymers were tested using a liquid batch-binding setup.  The batch-binding setup required the detection of analyte that was not bound in order to calculate by difference the fraction of analyte bound to the polymer.  Initially the terpenes were to be detected by a colorimetric method; however attempts to make the method sensitive and reliable were not successful.  In comparison, gas chromatography was more reliable for the detection of terpenes and was used for the experiments presented in this thesis.  1H-NMR studies of the interaction between &#945;-terpineol and acetic acid (as a non-polymerisable analogue of methacrylic acid) were investigated as a basis for understanding the binding to the carboxyl functional group moiety employed in many of the non-covalent MIPs that were made.  The interaction between (-)-menthol and phenol was also investigated because the phenol moiety was employed in the semi-covalent MIP.  Only selected MIPs, which appeared to specifically bind the template, were physically characterised.  This included optimising the batch-binding parameters, scanning electron microscopy imaging, surface area and pore radius analysis and in some cases Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy of the polymers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Molecularly imprinted polymers</field><field name="subject">porogen-imprinting</field><field name="subject">terpenes</field><field name="subject">non-covalent imprinting</field><field name="subject">semi-covalent imprinting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2264</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Important Messages from Students' Responsive Writing: s a big holloboleoos</field><field name="creator">Vanstone, Brooke</field><field name="description">This thesis explores responsive written feedback as a means of mediating the written language of six to eight year olds, including students traditionally minoritised within mainstream New Zealand classrooms because of cultural and/or language differences.  This research aimed to develop understandings about the effect responsive writing has on all of the students who participated, including those students whose second language was English.  A review of the literature identified the importance of socio-cultural contexts for mediating students' learning, including a specific examination of responsive written feedback and its effects on students' written language in English and in M&#257;ori medium settings.  Chapter two presents the mixed methods approach utilised in this research, which involves a retrospective look at two different responsive writing studies.  In chapters three and four, the results from these two studies are presented in terms of how effectively the responsive writing was undertaken by the responders and the extent to which the responsive writing strategy mediated both the quality and quantity of writing for the students who participated, including students whose second language was English.  These results suggest a very positive impact from mediating the learning of all students, including second language learners, within the context of responsive written feedback. The thesis concludes with implications for other teachers, from the existing students' outcome data and participants' interviews.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children's written language</field><field name="subject">responsive writing</field><field name="subject">English as a second language</field><field name="subject">mediated learning</field><field name="subject">minoritised groups</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2265</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The characterisation and role of mighty during myogenesis</field><field name="creator">Davies, Todd John</field><field name="description">Myogenesis, or skeletal muscle formation, begins during embryogenesis and involves the proliferation of myoblasts followed by their exit from the cell-cycle to differentiate and form myotubes. This formation of skeletal muscle is a complex process involving many genes and various signalling pathways. Mighty is a novel myogenic gene discovered at AgResearch by the Functional Muscle Genomics (FMG) group in a genetic screen performed on the muscle of myostatin null and wild-type mice. It was found that heavily muscled mice, lacking myostatin, had increased expression of the mighty gene. This gene was found to be conserved, with cognates found in mammals, amphibians, teleosts, and arthropods. Mighty was found to be expressed in a variety of tissues, but only skeletal muscle showed increased mighty mRNA expression in myostatin null mice, indicating the specific regulation of mighty by myostatin in skeletal muscle (Marshall, 2005).  The aim of this study was to characterise the mighty protein and examine its role in myogenesis to elucidate mighty's function. To undertake this study, antibodies specific for the full-length mighty protein and antibodies specific for a peptide region of mighty were characterised. Results using these antibodies, showed endogenous mighty, from myoblasts, to be a low-abundant, nuclear protein which shows a mobility of ~52 kDa in SDS gels, different to that of recombinant mighty protein. The mobility difference of endogenous mighty compared to recombinant mighty appears to be due to phosphorylation and may involve other post-translational modifications. In agreement, the determined isoelectric point (~5.7) of endogenous mighty also appears to be the result of phosphorylation. Interestingly, 52 kDa mighty was not detected in muscle extracts, but a ~30 kDa protein was specifically detected, indicating multiple forms, and subsequent roles, for mighty protein. Mass spectrometry (MS) was also performed for further characterisation of the mighty protein and possible post-translational modifications. Although hits were achieved with both recombinant mighty proteins, endogenous mighty MS analysis was not accomplished due to its low-abundance.  The function of the mighty protein in myoblasts was investigated during proliferation and differentiation. The results indicate that proliferating myoblasts have low levels of mighty in G0 and increased levels in G1/S during the cell cycle. This differential expression of mighty may involve cell cycle exit at the G1/S phase. Differentiation results showed mighty to be upregulated before MyoD during differentiation, placing mighty very early in the differentiation hierarchy. This agrees with previous results by Marshall (2005) which showed mighty to upregulate MyoD through IGF-II expression. Enhanced differentiation was also seen in double muscle bovine myoblasts concomitantly with increased mighty expression.  In conclusion, mighty appears to be a post-translationally modified protein that plays an early role in myogenic differentiation. This role in differentiation appears to be upstream of MyoD through the upregulation of IGF-II and may be linked to cell cycle exit in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">myogenesis</field><field name="subject">muscle</field><field name="subject">differentiation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">3D Shape Reconstruction from Multiple Range Image Views</field><field name="creator">Ganapathi Annadurai, Kartick</field><field name="description">Shape reconstruction of different three dimensional objects using multiple range images has evolved recently within the recent past. In this research shape reconstruction of a three dimensional object using multiple range image views is investigated. Range images were captured using the Waikato Range Imager. This range images camera is novel in that it uses heterodyne imaging and is capable of acquiring range images with precision less than a millimeter simultaneously over a full field. Multiple views of small objects were taken and the FastRBF was explored as a mean of registration and surface rendering. For comparison to the real range data, simulated range data under noise free condition were also generated and reconstructed with the FastRBF tool box. The registration and reconstruction of simple object was performed using different views with the FastRBF toolbox. Analysis of the registration process showed that the translation error produced due to distortion during registration of different views hinders the process of reconstructing a complete surface. While analyzing the shape reconstruction using the FastRBF tool it is also determined that a small change in accuracy values can affect the interpolation drastically. Results of reconstruction of a real 3D object from multiple views are shown.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">shape reconstruction</field><field name="subject">range images</field><field name="subject">FastRBF</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2267</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drying characteristics of New Zealand Chestnuts</field><field name="creator">Biju Cletus, Anila</field><field name="description">Chestnut is a relatively new nut crop to New Zealand and they do grow well in New Zealand conditions. Research to date in New Zealand indicated that New Zealand chestnuts present some unique features compared to chestnuts world wide. The two main unique problems with New Zealand chestnuts are the susceptibility to fungal disease Phomopsis (accounting for 40% loss of nuts at the wholesale markets) and the difficulty in the removal of the inner skin called the pellicle. No systematic drying trials had been performed on New Zealand chestnuts and therefore this research investigated the drying characteristics of New Zealand chestnuts to establish optimum drying conditions. The study also investigated the influence of the shell and pellicle on the drying process and the efficacy of shell and pellicle removal of New Zealand chestnuts under a range of moisture contents since the moisture content is a key factor which determines this efficiency.  The drying trials were carried out at a temperature of 30 C because preliminary studies indicated that higher temperatures resulted in extensive surface deterioration. Experimental drying curves are considered the only adequate preliminary step for determination of drying characteristics of a food material and the curves clearly indicated that there are two distinct falling rate periods. It was concluded that the first falling rate period corresponded to the period during which the surface of the nut reaches equilibrium moisture content and the second falling rate period occurred as the moisture movement from interior of the nut to the surface was the rate limiting factor. Hence a diffusion based model was used to estimate the apparent moisture diffusivity in chestnuts. The average apparent moisture diffusivity in chestnuts obtained at 30 C was 6.21x 10-11m2s-1. The study revealed that the pellicle is the most significant barrier to mass transfer; considerably more so than the shell. The shelling and peeling efficiency of New Zealand chestnuts were carried out at various moisture contents using a custom-made mechanical shelling machine. The mechanical shell removal of New Zealand chestnuts was accomplished with an efficiency of 94% at the desired storage moisture content of 40%. However mechanical pellicle removal of New Zealand chestnuts proved practically impossible although American varieties (Carolina and Revival) exhibited 100% peeling efficiency.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">none</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand Calanoid Copepod Invasions: Has Artificial Lake Construction Facilitated Invasions, and are our Coastal Waters Uninvaded?</field><field name="creator">Banks, Christopher Mark</field><field name="description">Non-indigenous species have become a global issue of increasing importance in recent years, with many causing significant environmental and economic damage. Identifying locations vulnerable to invasion allows for focus of management efforts towards prevention of invasions at those locations. In order to determine whether constructed water bodies, such as reservoirs, ornamental lakes or retired mines, are more easily invaded environments than natural water bodies, owing to decreased biotic resistance, the distributions of native and non-indigenous freshwater calanoid copepod species in the North Island were examined. Calanoid copepods in ports and other coastal environments were also examined, in order to determine whether ports are more frequently invaded owing to increased propagule supplies from visiting ships and other sources. The distributions of the native freshwater calanoid copepod species Boeckella hamata, B. propinqua, B. delicata and B. tanea are confined in the North Island of New Zealand to specific technostratigraphic terranes when natural waters only are examined, and as such each species can be considered to have a native range. The recently colonised calanoid copepod species Boeckella minuta (6 locations), Skistodiaptomus pallidus (3 locations) and Sinodiaptomus valkanovi (2 locations) are to date confined to constructed water bodies. Boeckella symmetrica (2 locations) may be confined to constructed water bodies, but the status of one location is unclear. Boeckella triarticulata, a species common in the South Island, is known only from a single farm dam in the North Island. The native species Boeckella hamata, B. propinqua and B. delicata were found to occur in constructed waters, but only B. propinqua was found in constructed water bodies outside their natural ranges (9 locations). Calamoecia lucasi is found in lakes throughout most of the North Island, and is not confined to any one terrane. My results indicate that constructed water bodies are more easily invaded by non-indigenous species than natural water bodies, represents a potential pathway for future invaders to establish, and provides locations for species to spread. In order to determine whether recently established freshwater calanoid copepod species have the potential to spread from their present habitats into other water bodies, the prosomal lengths of non-indigenous calanoid copepod species were measured and compared with those for native species. The results suggest that dietary overlap should prevent the non-indigenous species present to date from spreading into any water bodies with established Boeckella populations, although Sinodiaptomus valkanovi and Boeckella triarticulata could potentially spread to lakes containing only Calamoecia lucasi. Data on the co-occurrences of native freshwater calanoid copepod species support the theory of dietary exclusion, as Boeckella species have not been found to coexist. In order to test whether New Zealand marine environments have been invaded by non-indigenous calanoid copepods, and whether ports have been more regularly invaded than non-port areas, calanoid copepods were sampled from various coastal locations around the North Island. With the possible exception of Sulcanus conflictus, no non-indigenous species were found, indicating that non-indigenous marine calanoid copepod species are not establishing in New Zealand despite a history of invasion elsewhere.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Invasive species</field><field name="subject">Zooplankton</field><field name="subject">Boeckella</field><field name="subject">technostratigraphic terranes</field><field name="subject">biogeography</field><field name="subject">biotic resistance</field><field name="subject">propagule pressure</field><field name="subject">non-indigenous species</field><field name="subject">calanoid copepod</field><field name="subject">establishment</field><field name="subject">spread</field><field name="subject">distribution</field><field name="subject">lake</field><field name="subject">reservoir</field><field name="subject">co-occurrence</field><field name="subject">exclusion</field><field name="subject">aquatic</field><field name="subject">facilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the NCEA on teacher collegiality</field><field name="creator">Barrett, Jenny</field><field name="description">This study looks at the impact that the National Certification of Educational Achievement (NCEA) has had on teacher collegiality in New Zealand. It is an exploratory study using an in case and cross case method, located in four secondary schools with a range of demographics. I was interested in gathering the information from teachers in three key roles: Assistant teacher, Head of Department and Principal's Nominee, finding out what their views were on the change that the NCEA has bought to their professional lives and the impact made on their collegiality. The literature reviewed shows there is an international appreciation of the value of collegiality in schools but there is a fragile nature of collegiality that challenges its strength. The complexity of school culture and the symbiotic relationship between it and collegiality contributes to challenge of the management and development in secondary schools. The findings showed the teachers in this study considered there to have been a deepening in collegiality as a result of increased sharing of material, professional communication through moderation and professional development, and a heightened respect for professional practice and understanding of personalities. There are threats from reduced socialisation, workload, loss of autonomy and the fragility of collegiality. These elements have created a shift in school culture. How teacher collegiality can best be supported using this assessment policy has been explored with features involving school organisation and increasing deep collegial activities such as collegial observation, marking, moderating and review being identified as beneficial.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">The NCEA</field><field name="subject">teacher collegiality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personal Trainers: Motivating and Moderating Client Exercise Behaviour</field><field name="creator">Sweet, Wendy Gaylene</field><field name="description">First established in the 1990's, the personal training industry in New Zealand has experienced unprecedented growth. Over 80% of New Zealand health clubs market the services of Personal Trainers and there are now over 1500 registered Personal Trainers working in a range of settings. Their primary professional role is one whereby they promote and support individuals to attain desired 'results' in relation to their physical fitness and particularly, to adopt a more physically active lifestyle. But despite the growth of this industry, little is known about how Personal Trainers actually go about supporting the clients who purchase their service to find a way into, as well as stay committed to a physically activity lifestyle. To date there has been no research in New Zealand exploring how Personal Trainers operate as agents of behaviour change. Furthermore, there appears only anecdotal evidence about how the intervention strategies used by Personal Trainers reflect those recommended in the 'behaviour-change' literature.  This thesis focused on the daily, working experiences of ten Personal Trainers. Inspired by the interpretive paradigm, in-depth interviews were conducted and analysis of the data, guided by the tenets of grounded theory, allowed the story about the way each participant went about her/his work to emerge. The study highlights a variety of issues that these Trainers recognise as significantly influencing their ability to succeed in an increasingly competitive and demanding business. Specific reference was also given to the behavioural intervention strategies that each participant believed were the most beneficial in nurturing client lifestyle behaviour-change.  The study outcomes reveal that although the Trainers worked independently of each other there was considerable commonality in the approaches they had developed. All agreed on the importance of presenting themselves as confident, competent professionals who modelled healthy life-styles to their clients. Some of the strategies they used were similar in some regards to those described in the intervention literature, but others were not. A salient point made by all was that, despite some of their practices lying outside the professional boundaries defined by their professional registration organisation, the provision of services to clients often went beyond the 'physical'. Nutritional counselling especially had become an integral part of the service they provided for clients and was, in fact, an area which clients 'expected' them to be experts in. Each acknowledged the challenge of devising strategies to keep their clients committed, motivated and returning to them. The study highlighted two distinct phases of intervention as the Trainers used different motivational approaches to firstly, initiate change and then maintain their client's progress. As the clients began to see results all of the trainers agreed that their relationship with their long-term clients became more collegial. As time progressed, and in order to facilitate and foster client belief in the inherent value of physical activity 'for life', the Trainers became their client's Life Coach. The Personal Trainers in this study described a multitude of roles that each believed they needed to fulfil in order that they achieved on-going success as a Trainer. This emphasises the need for a more expansive education programme for Personal Trainers. Programmes which move beyond a traditional fitness discourse and better reflect the complexities of what it truly means to be a one-on-one 'Trainer'.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Personal Trainer</field><field name="subject">changing exercise-behaviour</field><field name="subject">exercise prescription</field><field name="subject">nutrition counseling</field><field name="subject">Life-Coach</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2271</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Life-history Analysis of Achievement of M&#257;ori and Pacific Island Students at the Church College of New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Solomon, Tereapii Elinora</field><field name="description">The Church College of New Zealand is a private co-educational secondary school located near Hamilton, New Zealand and is sponsored by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Since its opening in 1958, it has hosted a large population of Polynesian students, in particular M&#257;ori.  The questions that this thesis addresses centre on the nature, history and reasons for what seems to be a disproportionately higher level of achievement amongst M&#257;ori and Pacific Island students at Church College than in New Zealand more broadly.  Through a life-history approach to research, this thesis provides an overview of the rich history behind the building of the Church College, and highlights the experiences of successful graduates over three particular timeframes - 1951-1969, 1970-1989 and the 1990s.  A major contributing factor to the success of the students at Church College is an environment where both religious and cultural values of students are reaffirmed and considered normal.  For some students, Church College provided an environment that validated what students were being taught in their own homes.  For others, it provided a refuge from a conflicted home.  With the growing pressures of social problems within the wider community for many M&#257;ori and Pacific Island families, the school environment of  the Church College was a key factor in providing stability  and security for some students at the College.  On June 29 2006, an announcement was made by leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints of the phased out closure of Church College beginning in the year 2007 and eventually closing at the end of the year 2009. With M&#257;ori and Pacific Island students so under-represented in achievement and participation in education settings in New Zealand, the announcement of the closure provided an opportunity to highlight some of the successes experienced at the Church College of New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Church College</field><field name="subject">underachievement of maori students</field><field name="subject">underachievement of pacific island students</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Pacific Islanders</field><field name="subject">academic acheivement</field><field name="subject">secondary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Principal Voice: Triumphs, Trials and Training. The Experience of Beginning in Principalship from the Perspectives of Principals in Years 3 - 5.</field><field name="creator">Patuawa, Jacqueline Margaret</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT It is widely accepted that the quality of school leadership and school improvement are inextricably linked. Therefore it can be said that, investment in principal development is an investment in quality schools, and therefore an investment in the future. This report describes a qualitative research project undertaken in 2006, to examine the experience of beginning in principalship in New Zealand, from the perspectives of principals now in their third to fifth year in the role. It attempts to seek answers to questions:  	What training do those entering principalship receive prior to taking up the role? 	How are principals supported as they begin in the role?  	What support is available to them currently - beyond the induction period? 	What training and support is considered to be effective by beginning principals?  	What else could do they believe could be introduced to enhance current support and training? Twelve principals were interviewed, from a diverse range of school contexts, individually, and then a focus group approach was used to affirm and clarify emergent findings, and to suggest a potential model for improved development.  A review of the literature identified a series of stages that principals move through during their career and the importance of professional learning to support each career stage. It highlighted several strategies deemed to be effective in assisting the development of leadership within the stages identified. The literature concluded, that while there is an awareness of both the stages of leadership, and the importance of targeted development to meet the needs of individuals throughout those stages, most learning remains organisationally rather than individually focussed, and there remains a lack of a planned, structured and synergistic approach to principal development. The biggest area of concern is suggested as being in the stage where principals are deemed to be effective.  The research findings showed that in the current New Zealand context, there are several effective strategies enhancing principal professional learning. It does, however, conclude with several recommendations for strengthening and enhancing the status quo. Participants in the research suggested that many of the current initiatives offered, remain isolated from each other and now need to be brought into a more robust and aligned framework. There is a perception from those involved in the research, that beyond the induction period, currently eighteen months, there is a void in professional learning opportunities, and that principals struggle to get targeted feedback that allows them to identify their needs. They further suggested that greater preparation for principalship on appointment was required, and believed that a period shadowing an experienced colleague would be invaluable.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">principals</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Papua New Guinea Primary School Technology Teachers: The Impacts of Support Materials on Their Perceptions and Practices</field><field name="creator">Hagunama, Eron</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the perceptions of technology and technology education held by six primary school teachers in Papua New Guinea, and their views of the materials developed to use as a support for teaching technology and the impacts on their perceptions and their teaching practices of technology. Based on the interpretivist paradigm, a case study approach and qualitative data collection methods were used to explore the teachers' views of technology and technology education and how the support materials influenced these perceptions and practices. One to one, semistructured interviews with the teachers, and an analysis of their planning documents were used to collect data. As part of the curriculum reforms, technology education was introduced as a new subject into primary education in PNG in 1994. However, no formal professional development was provided for helping the primary teachers implement technology education. Instead, curriculum materials were developed and distributed to teachers in 2005 as a support for their technology teaching. This thesis supports the idea that teachers need support to help them learn. It is also argues that teachers' beliefs about subject areas, teaching, their students, and curriculum materials influence how they interact with these support materials. The findings show that the support materials were very useful in enhancing the teachers' knowledge of technology and effective teaching of technology. There were changes to teachers' perceptions of technology and technological practices when they began to use the support materials. Changes included the views of technology as more than modern artefacts to include traditional technology, that technology was more than just practical. It also has a knowledge base. However, not all aspects of technology as advocated in the support materials have been taken up by these teachers. Problem-solving and design aspects have received marginal attention. Other factors were at play including subject subcultures, subject backgrounds, past hands-on experiences and ownership of personal technological artefacts. To be even more effective technology teachers, it is advocated that teacher professional development is required for Papua New Guinean primary teachers to implement the technology successfully.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">primary school technology teachers</field><field name="subject">professional  development and support materials</field><field name="subject">perceptions and practices of teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reactions of Some Cyclomanganated Compounds with C-Nitroso Compounds, Allenes, and Ketenimines</field><field name="creator">Revell, John Bernard</field><field name="description">eta2-(5-Methoxy-2-acetylphenyl)tetracarbonylmanganese (30) was reacted with 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane (31) to form 2-acetyl-5-methoxy-N-(tert-butyl)aniline(43) in low yield.

This perception was heightened by the military coups of 1987, which overthrew the democratically elected government of Dr. Timoci Bavadra because it was perceived as Indian-dominated. Again in 2000, the People's Coalition Government headed by an Indian, Mahendra Chaudhry, was ousted in a civilian coup.  Yet Fiji had been genuinely multiethnic for several decades (even centuries) before it became a colony in 1874. From then onwards, however, because of the policies of the colonial government, the society slowly became plural (in Furnivall's classic sense) as the different races were separated in almost every walk of life. Until the 1920s there were hardly any conflicts between Fijians and Indians.  From the 1920s, however, the Fijians were taught to be wary of the Indians.  After independence in 1970, the Alliance government under Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara followed a policy of  multiracialism  with the stated aim of bringing the different ethnic groups together in a society where people achieved some degree of integration in terms of a common national identity, while retaining their own separate traditions.  But, more than thirty years later, Fiji still remains an ethnically divided society with hardly any integration. My research explores the reason for this failure.  My thesis is that the failure arose from the kind of democratic system that the country adopted at independence. That is, the Westminster concept of government and opposition can be problematic in a multiethnic society if political parties are divided on ethnic lines rather than based on political ideologies. Ratu Mara was one Fiji leader who recognized this problem and had said that the confrontational Westminster system is not appropriate in a South Pacific island with a multiracial population.  While Stephanie Lawson, Peter Larmour, Futa Helu and others have made some important contribution to this debate, my thesis will focus on an argument put forward by  Michael Goldsmith on the role of the opposition, making a distinction between two kinds of pposition,  confrontational  and  thoughtful . This thesis contends that the Westminster system that Fiji adopted at independence failed to bring integration in part because the National Federation Party (NFP) degenerated over the years from a 'thoughtful' and effective opposition to a 'confrontational', ethnic opposition.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiji</field><field name="subject">racial harmony</field><field name="subject">race relations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A flow-through enzyme-linked immunoassay for progesterone</field><field name="creator">Orchard, Robert Graham</field><field name="description">Bovine reproductive performance is one of the most important factors influencing dairy farm profitability. Present-day techniques for oestrus- and pregnancy-detection are unreliable and labour-intensive. Although measuring milk-progesterone at regular intervals allows the fertility status of a cow to be determined reliably, the labour cost of collecting and analysing samples is prohibitive. This project aimed to develop a progesterone sensing system that could be automated and integrated with the milking unit, thus minimising labour costs. The proposed system involved mixing the milk sample with an enzyme-antibody conjugate and then passing the sample through a column containing immobilised progesterone. Any progesterone in the milk would inhibit conjugate binding to the column. An enzyme substrate would then flow through the column and bound conjugate would be detected as a colour change at the column's outlet. Periodate-coupling was used to attach horseradish peroxidase enzyme to anti-progesterone antibody, and progesterone-3-carboxymethyloxime was immobilised on the polystyrene bead surface using amine-coupling. Both techniques are widely used. Initial experiments attempted to verify the success of these two reactions simultaneously, whereas later experiments focused on the bead-coating. Beads were suspended in a specially-constructed syringe and the antibody activity of the eluted solution was measured by SPR. However, a combination of non-specific binding and antibody stability and activity issues meant neither reaction was conclusively verified. Many trials were done to investigate how to overcome the problems encountered but a suitable, workable procedure was not developed. Despite poor progress, the problems encountered did not undermine the project's potential. There remains optimism of developing an on-line method if research were to continue.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">progesterone</field><field name="subject">bovine</field><field name="subject">fertility</field><field name="subject">reproduction</field><field name="subject">ELISA</field><field name="subject">enzyme</field><field name="subject">assay</field><field name="subject">column</field><field name="subject">beads</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-designing Greenstone for Seniors</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Erin Kay</field><field name="description">The golden generation have a wealth of experience and knowledge from throughout their lifetimes that younger generations wish to retain. In our technology filled world an obvious means of collecting this information is electronically. Digital library col- lections are increasingly used by libraries and large institutions to record their large amounts of information but they can also be used for personal collections. Seniors are often willing and keen to impart their years of experience upon people of the younger generation but time is not always on their side as they grow older. Throughout a lifetime a person could collect large amounts of papers, diaries, pho- tos and media but the time it takes to organise these documents can be long and exhausting and the person's health is not always at its best in old age. Greenstone is a suite of software for creating digital libraries, which are organised collections of documents. Greenstone has the ability to distribute collections either using a server or CD-ROM, and provides advanced searching and organization tools. While Greenstone is a versatile and useful tool in creating digital collections, its in- terface is not designed for senior users. Seniors are commonly perceived to have more physical and mental disadvantages as they get older. These disadvantages can dramatically affect how usable seniors find a piece of software. The aim of this thesis is to investigate how usable the current Greenstone interface is for use by seniors and to re-design the interface so that Greenstone may be more easily used by senior users. This thesis focuses upon what types of documents and descriptive data seniors would like to include in a collection about their life. This is to ascertain exactly what parts of the interface must be improved when it comes to metadata and classifiers. The results of this investigation also helped in the creation of a customised metadata set for senior users use.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Greenstone</field><field name="subject">Seniors</field><field name="subject">Usability</field><field name="subject">Human Computer Interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preparation of Stable Gold Colloids for Sensitivity Enhancement of Progesterone Immunoassay using Surface Plasmon Resonance</field><field name="creator">Wu, Kevin Su-Wei</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to prepare concentrated and stable gold colloids for the enhancement of the signal response of the SPR technique for detecting small molecules such as progesterone. The gold colloids developed in this study were prepared by hydrazine hydrate, sodium borohydride, and tri-potassium citrate reduction routes. The study revealed that the sodium borohydride reduced gold colloids were extremely stable and it was able to be utilised in the progesterone immunoassay developed previously by Mitchell et al. The experiment was carried out on BIAcore 3000 using two different sensor surfaces (CM5 and SAM). The results showed that the enhancement species prepared from the borohydride-reduced gold colloids were able to improve the SPR signal response by 13 times higher than SPR signal produced without the enhancement species on the CM5 surface. The signal enhancement on the SAM surface using the same enhancement species was even greater at 29 times higher. The sensitivity of the assay was, however, unable to be determined due to time constraint. The limit of detection (LOD) of the progesterone assay using the CM5 chip was estimated to be ca. 5-20 pg/mL. Whilst for the SAM chip, the LOD of the progesterone assay was estimated to be ca. 5-20 fg/mL. Further work is required to confirm these estimated LOD values.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gold colloids</field><field name="subject">surface plasmon resonance</field><field name="subject">arabinogalactan</field><field name="subject">sensitivity enhancement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Keeping up with the 'digital natives': Integrating Web 2.0 technologies into classroom practice.</field><field name="creator">Cleary, Alison</field><field name="description">This report describes a self-study using an action research spiral of problem analysis, intervention design, trial, reflection and analysis. The main purpose of the study was to investigate and evaluate whether Web 2.0 technologies and, in particular, social software could be effectively integrated into a senior secondary English classroom.  The methodology used in the study, while mainly qualitative, did include a degree of quantitative data-gathering. The study took place over two terms of the 2007 school year in a semi-rural school south of Auckland. My Year 12 English class of twenty-four students were participants in the study and I was the teacher-researcher. As part of the study the students responded to my 'blog' and created and maintained their own 'blogs'. These 'voices' are important threads in this narrative. Two of my colleagues acted as 'critical friends' in this process.  During the study my own beliefs regarding new technology and the descriptor 'digital natives' were challenged. While the data collected and the interpretative analysis of it created further questions that need to be addressed, the findings indicate that there is a place for Web 2.0 technology and social software in English classrooms. The findings also show that in order for these applications to be integrated effectively, a number of issues need to be addressed.

Seven caregivers of loved ones with Alzheimer's Dementia (mostly spousal) were interviewed about their experiences of caregiving and their emotional well-being after placement of their loved one into a residential care facility or death. The  nature of the carers relationship with their loved one (e.g.  highly dependent), lack of social supports, inactivity and a poor experience of transition into care seemed to be factors relating to poorer outcomes for these caregivers. Utilisation of social supports, involvement in pleasant events, adequate preparation and information relating to the disease and collaboratively planned transition into care played protective roles for the remaining carers who reported decreased levels of anxiety, guilt, depression and stress post-institutionalisation/death. The implications of the current research for practise, policy change and prevention are extensive and suggest that risk factors may be identifiable and thus poorer mental health outcomes in caregivers preventable.

This thesis sought to investigate the distribution of amphidromous and non-amphidromous common bully in the Tarawera River by examining fish collected from upstream (37 km inland) and downstream (20 km inland) locations and comparing them to fish from similar inland locations (40 km and 17 km inland, respectively) in the nearby Rangitaiki River. Otolith microchemistry revealed life-history differences between upstream and downstream populations and stable isotope analysis ensured long-term site residency. Amphidromy dominated in the downstream river populations, while the disappearance of diadromous fish generally occurred with inland distance. A mixture of diadromous and non-diadromous fish were found in the upstream Rangitaiki, while a complete absence of diadromous recruits was found in the upstream Tarawera River. A reduction in oculoscapular canal structures also coincided with loss of diadromy in fish from both rivers. Temporal reproductive divergence was investigated through track annual trends in gonadosomatic index. The Tarawera River receives significant inputs from numerous industrial, municipal and natural sources, most notably from two pulp and paper mills. In the absence physical barriers in the Tarawera, it has been hypothesised that the lack of diadromous recruits in the upstream Tarawera River may be related to aquatic discharges in the downstream river. A behavioural study was performed to examine the hypothesis that pulp and paper mill effluent may be acting as a chemical barrier to fish migration within the river. A dual-choice chamber was employed to examine the responses of common bully exposed to a range of effluent concentrations (100, 50, 25, 12.5, 0% v/v). Fish exhibited significant avoidance responses when exposed to 100 and 50% effluent concentration, while no avoidance was observed at effluent concentrations below 50% This study demonstrated that common bully show a strong preference for river water when simultaneously exposed to effluent, albeit at environmentally unrealistic concentrations (i.e. greater than 15%), implicating potential for this effluent to act as a chemical barrier in the Tarawera River. Following the establishment of reproductive timing of common bully in the Tarawera River, a wild fish health assessment was undertaken to investigate the effects of long-term effluent exposure in situ. Adult common bully were sampled downstream of the mill influence and compared to an appropriate reference population from the downstream Rangitaiki River. Male and female fish from the Tarawera River demonstrated 6- to 9-fold greater ethoxyresorufin-O&#172;-deethylase (EROD) activity compared to reference fish, indicating exposure to organic contaminants in this river. Tarawera females showed some minor variation in hematological variables including decreased mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell haemoglobin (MCH) and increased total white blood cell count (WBCC) suggestive of an immune response. Slightly greater ovarian follicular steroid production in Tarawera fish potentially indicates some form of endocrine alteration. However, this response may also be related to differences in reproductive synchrony and gonadal development between the two fish populations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gobiomorphus cotidianus</field><field name="subject">effluent discharges</field><field name="subject">fish</field><field name="subject">pulp and paper</field><field name="subject">Tarawera River</field><field name="subject">Rangitaiki River</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2282</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental Management in Micro and Small Tourism Enterprises: An Owner-manager Perspective</field><field name="creator">Rainford, Sophie Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to gain insight into environmental management implemented by micro and small tourism enterprises and explore levels of awareness and interest among owner-managers of micro and small tourism enterprises toward schemes aiming for the environmental improvement of business.  The research uncovers findings that elevate possibilities for reducing misinterpretation of terminology relative to sustainable tourism business.  This research seeks to understand why the suggested lack of sustainable tourism implementation remains evident in tourism.  Discussion from findings intends to draw attention to central themes relative to achieving research objectives and seeks to yield important information in the pursuit of sustainable tourism business.  A qualitative, semi-structured interview approach was used to gain in-depth and detailed perspectives from owner-managers of micro and small tourism enterprises.  Owner-managers interviewed were purposively chosen using non-probability sampling.  Selection was based on providing a variety of tourism businesses and physical business locations across the case study region.  Overall, findings suggest that owner-managers are implementing low levels of environmental management and have limited knowledge of what implementation of environmental management specifically involves, such as, how long it takes and how much it costs.  The underlying values of owner-managers demonstrate potential opportunities for further implementation of sustainable business practice.  In addition, owner-managers seemed to place importance in conducting business responsibly and having minimal impact on the environment so that quality of life remains for future generations.

However, while MI theory has found a ready audience amongst early childhood and primary school educators, and has been associated with a wide range of positive outcomes across a variety of educational settings, it continues to have little impact on secondary school practice. The aim of this qualitative action research project was to establish a collaborative research group of four junior secondary school teachers, who were interested in exploring MI theory and its implications for learning and teaching. In documenting their experiences, the project aimed to find out whether an MI-based programme was feasible in a junior secondary school context, and to identify the difficulties and barriers that impeded the participating teachers' endeavours to implement MI in their classrooms. The following research questions provided the focus for the project: 1. Can an MI-based approach to teaching and learning be successfully implemented in a junior secondary school programme? 2. What are the issues that secondary school teachers face when implementing MI into their classroom programmes? 3. What are the best ways to address these issues? iii A multiple case study approach provided an effective means of illustrating the individual complexity of teachers' situations, as they interacted with their students, the curriculum, their colleagues and their school environment, and was also flexible enough to accommodate the open-ended and evolving nature of the investigation. The following outcomes for teachers as a result of the MI project were noted: (a) Increased awareness and understanding of student diversity. (b) Extended teaching practice and enhanced teacher creativity. (c) Improved planning framework. (d) Teachers' beliefs about learning and intelligence were affirmed and extended. (e) Teachers experienced improved confidence in their abilities as teachers. (f) The emergence of a cohesive student-centred curriculum. (g) Improved collegiality. As a result of the project, many barriers to implementing MI theory into junior secondary school classrooms were identified, under the following categories: (a) Barriers relating to teacher culture (b) Barriers relating to management requirements (c) Barriers relating to time (d) Barriers relating to personnel (e) Barriers relating to external pressures on the school The outcomes of this project confirm findings in the research literature, which suggest that MI theory can provide a valuable philosophical and structural iv framework that helps teachers develop a greater awareness of student diversity and enhanced teaching practice, as well as the understanding that a uniform approach to teaching and learning meets the needs of too few. However, a number of entrenched structural and cultural barriers characteristic of the secondary school context were also identified, which suggest that the adoption of MI-based teaching practices on a wider scale is unlikely without an in-depth school-wide professional development initiative.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theory of multiple intelligences</field><field name="subject">MI theory</field><field name="subject">multiple intelligences</field><field name="subject">intelligence</field><field name="subject">secondary school</field><field name="subject">high school</field><field name="subject">curriculum innovation</field><field name="subject">educational innovation</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">high school</field><field name="subject">junior high school</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kimihia, rangahaua ng&#257; tikanga heke iho.

This thesis represents the culmination of a personal and professional journey, derived from the writer's longstanding interest in and commitment to kaupapa M&#257;ori early childhood education, and more specifically, philosophies and practices for assessment in this context. The study has canvassed a vast terrain of kaupapa M&#257;ori philosophy in its search for a theoretical grounding for a kaupapa M&#257;ori assessment framework for early childhood education. Foundation to the study has been the premise that the notion of whakapapa serves as an overarching philosophical matrix, encompassing the interconnected realms of genealogy, spirituality, and knowledge that precede, surround, and embrace the M&#257;ori child. Throughout the thesis, diagrams are employed to demonstrate and model the whakapapa underpinning the conceptualisations being explored. After contextualising the study within a historical overview of the impact of colonisation of kaupapa M&#257;ori education and research, it is suggested that a re-examination of key concepts from tikanga M&#257;ori will illuminate transformative possibilities applicable to the study's focus on the development of a theoretical base for an assessment tool within kaupapa M&#257;ori early childhood settings. Drawing from the literature, the thesis re-positions the view of the M&#257;ori child to one of being nurtured within a philosophical construct underpinned and immersed in tikanga such as whakapapa, ira tangata, whanaungatanga, mana and tapu, and ako, providing a strongly M&#257;ori theoretical base for the envisioning of the assessment process. The outcome of this study is to propose an assessment framework, which embodies and reflects these core kaupapa M&#257;ori philosophies as praxis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kaupapa Maori assessment</field><field name="subject">early childhood assessment</field><field name="subject">ira tangata</field><field name="subject">mana and tapu</field><field name="subject">whakapapa</field><field name="subject">whanaungatanga</field><field name="subject">Te Tamaiti Maori</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lake Rotokakahi: The kakahi (Hyridella menziesi) in a general framework of lake health.</field><field name="creator">Butterworth, Joseph</field><field name="description">Lake Rotokakahi is a mesotrophic lake located within the Rotorua Lakes District, North Island, New Zealand. Under the legal guardianship of the Tuhourangi and Ngati Tumatawera tribes of Te Arawa it has remained closed to the public since 1948. Lake Rotokakahi was last monitored regularly in 1996 under the Environment Bay of Plenty (EBOP) water quality monitoring programme with only the lake outlet (Te Wairoa Stream) being monitored since that time. Water quality data collected up to 1996 suggests that there may be degradation of water quality in the lake, as indicated by declining levels of dissolved oxygen in the bottom waters.  Lake Rotokakahi steeped in historical significance, as well as having major cultural and recreational values was well known for its abundant resources and as the name suggests, particularly for its massive supply of the freshwater mussel or kakahi (Hyridella menziesi). Freshwater mussel species worldwide are in decline however little is known on factors controlling kakahi abundance and distribution. The overarching objective of this thesis is update water quality data last monitored in Lake Rotokakahi in 1996 while also identifying key environmental variables thought to influence kakahi populations.  This objective is underpinned by a number of aims that include: 	Establishment of a 12-13 month water quality programme within Lake Rotokakahi so that data is obtained for comparisons with previous water quality data (pre-1997) to allow assessment of whether there have been water quality changes in the lake. 	Conduct a population survey of the resident kakahi population examining possible environmental factors influencing their populations. 	Present an oral history of Lake Rotokakahi focusing on its historical significance, water quality, and collection of kairoto (food collected form lakes).  from the 18 September 2006 to 14 September 2007 monthly water sampling was carried out at a mid lake station, the lake outflow and inflow for measures of nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton and chlorophyll a. Vertical profiles of temperature dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence were also taken on various part of Lake Rotokakahi.  A lengthened period of anoxia in the bottom waters during thermal stratification was recorded with increased levels of chlorophyll a in winter and reduced secchi disk depth indicating an increase in phytoplankton biomass. Nutrient concentrations remain moderate relative to historical data. On going water quality monitoring on Lake Rotokakahi is recommended to further evaluate the extent of which water quality change is occurring. This will provide a better understanding of how Lake Rotokakahi can be best managed to further preserve the lake.  On 1 March and 20 April kakahi were sampled at five sites. Large kakahi densities were distributed predominantly in depths above the hypolimnion. Chlorophyll a fluorescence and dissolved oxygen were found to be the best correlates for kakahi density and biomass respectively. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations in the hypolimnion are thought to restrict kakahi distributions to above the thermocline in periods of hypolimnetic anoxia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rotokakahi</field><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="subject">Hyridella</field><field name="subject">freshwater mussel</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shore Platform observation at Tatapouri and Mahia Peninsula, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Te Aho, Murray</field><field name="description">Measuring the shore platform width might be an effective way to measure the rate of coastal retreat.

To enhance the construct validity, two guidelines were applied to the creation of the interview based on previous research in interview and assessment center literature limit the number of applicant characteristics to be rated to 3; and (2) ensure that the dimensions to be measured are conceptually distinct. Based on these two guidelines, three constructs were chosen for assessment of real estate sales agents extraversion, proactive personality and customer orientation.  The critical incident technique was used to develop six interview items.  To test the construct validity of the interview, the six items were correlated with other measures, specifically, self-report questionnaires and managers' ratings, of extraversion, proactivity and customer orientation.  Correlations were weak, at best (rs ranged from -.06 to .25).  To test the predictive validity of the interview, the six items were correlated with both objective and subjective measures of performance.  Predictive validities were stronger, ranging from .23 to .30.  These findings are consistent with previous research on employment interviews which have found that although the predictive validity of the interview is strong, the construct validity is very weak, leaving researchers to wonder what it is that the interview is actually measuring. Possible explanations for these findings are offered, and the implications of these findings are discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">selection</field><field name="subject">sales</field><field name="subject">interview</field><field name="subject">construct validity</field><field name="subject">criterion validity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2288</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Smart Phone as a Mouse</field><field name="creator">Qin, Yinghao</field><field name="description">With the development of hardware, mobile phone has become a feature-rich handheld device.

The coastal town of Matata in the Eastern Bay of Plenty provides a central case study location as it is a town that is facing the pressure of coastal residential development as well the added strain of dealing with the 2005 flood which has compounded issues over local waahi tapu.  Local iwi have continued to actively advocate for the protection of these sites especially with regard to the ongoing discovery of ancestral bones.  Cultural and emotional geographies provide the theoretical framework for this research. This framework has been particularly useful as it encourages reflexive commentary and alternative ways of approaching and thinking about, and understanding knowledge. I have incorporated the research paradigm of kaupapa M&#257;ori which complements my theoretical framework by producing a research design that is organised and shaped according to tikanga M&#257;ori while (in) advertently critiquing and challenging traditional ways of conducting research. The overall aim is to explore the current issues surrounding the discovery of ancestral bones through korero with local iwi members. It is through their perspectives, stories, beliefs and opinions that provide a better understanding of the meanings attributed to waahi tapu and the influence of certain events such as the 2005 flood. I examine, critically the relationship between power, sacred sites, bones and the body. It is from these objectives that I contribute to an area of scholarship that has been largely left out from geographical enquiry. I suggest that the importance of sacredness and spirituality has been relatively overlooked as an influential factor in people's perceptions of the world around them. This thesis is intended to demonstrate the value of indigenous perspectives of bones, the body and sacredness as a way of better understanding some of the complexities that can arise when cross-cultural approaches collide in environmental planning.  There are three main themes that have emerged from this research. The first theme has to do with competing knowledges. To M&#257;ori, the location and knowledge of ancestral bones is culturally important and is in its self sacred, therefore certain tikanga is applied as a means of a protection mechanism. However this ideologically clashes with traditional scientific western approaches which are privileged over other alternative ways of understanding knowledge, in this case M&#257;ori knowledge. The second related theme concerns the process of boundary making and cross-cultural ways of perceiving 'sacred' and 'everyday' spaces. To better understand these perspectives involves acknowledging the embodied and emotional experience of w&#257;hi tapu to M&#257;ori, and the active role of kaitiaki in the protection and careful management of these culturally important spaces.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sacred</field><field name="subject">emotional geography</field><field name="subject">kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="subject">death</field><field name="subject">human bones</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population Ecology of Thelymitra matthewsii  Cheeseman  Orchidaceae, in  Northern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Elizabeth Anne</field><field name="description">The terrestrial orchid Thelymitra matthewsii Cheeseman, uncommon in New Zealand, was studied to increase knowledge of the species life cycle, morphology and ecology. Results will enhance future conservation management for the species.  New information related to the morphology of T. matthewsii was obtained. The species was found to emerge in one of four discrete life stages of distinctive morphology and height range that remained constant for the season, not developing into a more advanced life stage. The leaf of the three pre adult life stages designated a hook, a spiral, and a non flowering stage, did not inflate at the base, but rose smoothly from the tuber. Apparent morphological differences in the column between descriptions of the Australian taxon and the small New Zealand sample examined suggested further study was needed.  Comprehensive monthly monitoring was carried out at five study sites in three locations in the Te Paki area of the Far North, from 2002 to 2004. No patterns emerged in plant life stage succession, flowering, and presence or absence at labels reinforcing the concept that variability was a common component of the population census.  Seasonal and partial absence was a major component of the populations. An average of 32.8% of plants, over five study sites, were present throughout three seasons, while 66.9% were recorded as absent (not visible) at monitoring. New plants appearing in 2003 and 2004 showed a high percentage of subsequent absence (mean 85.7%).  To determine population stability, recruitment and absence were compared. Plant absence exceeded recruitment by 7% (mean plant absence 30.5%; mean recruitment 23.4%). Plants continued to appear during the monitoring period, and labeled plants increased two-fold over commencement numbers.  Adults recorded as 28% of labeled plants over three seasons, were out numbered by pre-flowering stages. Only 5% of population numbers exhibited succession from a smaller to a flowering plant. Life stage modeling indicated a life stage was more likely to be followed by the same stage than an expected successive stage.  Thelymitra matthewsii was found to be present in four substrates in the Far North. The survey of vegetation found the indigenous species Kunzea ericoides and the exotic Hakea gibbosa dominant for both height, and cover. Litter and bare ground dominated ground cover. Differences in vegetation and ground cover, of sites supporting T. matthewsii and comparison sites that did not, were minor and suggested that another factor, for example a suitable fungal partner, influenced the species presence or absence. The results of the study indicated the present threat classification of Thelymitra matthewsii is inadequate in the light of the species  relatively circumscribed, widely separated habitats, the small number of reproducing individuals and vulnerability to habitat modification.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thelymitra matthewsii</field><field name="subject">Orchidaceae</field><field name="subject">population ecology</field><field name="subject">morphology</field><field name="subject">classification</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remote Sensing of Water  Quality in Rotorua and Waikato Lakes</field><field name="creator">Allan, Mathew Grant</field><field name="description">Remote sensing has the potential to monitor spatial variation in water quality over large areas.  While ocean colour work has developed analytical bio-optical water quality retrieval algorithms for medium spatial resolution platforms, remote sensing of lake water is often limited to high spatial resolution satellites such as Landsat, which have limited spectral resolution.  This thesis presents the results of an investigation into satellite monitoring of lake water quality.  The aim of this investigation was to ascertain the feasibility of estimating water quality and its spatial distribution using Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery combined with in situ data from Rotorua and Waikato lakes.  For the comparatively deep Rotorua lakes, r&#178; values of 0.91 (January 2002) and 0.83 (March 2002) were found between in situ chlorophyll (chl) a and the Band1/Band3 ratio.  This technique proved useful for analysing the spatial distribution of phytoplankton, especially in lakes Rotoiti and Rotoehu.  For the more bio-optically complex shallow lakes of the Waikato, a linear spectral unmixing (LSU) approach was investigated where the water surface reflectance spectrum is defined by the contribution from pure pixels or endmembers.  The model estimates the percentage of the endmember within the pixel, which is then used in a final regression with in situ data to map water quality in all pixels.  This approach was used to estimate the concentration of chl a (r&#178; = 0.84).  Total suspended solid (TSS) concentration was mapped using the traditional Band 3 regression with in situ data, which combined atmospherically corrected reflectance for both images into a single relationship (r&#178; = 0.98).  The time difference between in situ data collection and satellite data capture is a potential source of error.  Other potential sources of error include sample location accuracy, the influence of dissolved organic matter, and masking of chl a signatures by high concentrations of TSS.  The results from this investigation suggest that remote sensing of water quality provides meaningful and useful information with a range of applications and could provide information on temporal spatial variability in water quality.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">remote sensing</field><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="subject">landsat</field><field name="subject">linear spectral unmixing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recognition of Facial Affect in individuals scoring high and low on Psychopathic Personality Characteristics</field><field name="creator">Ali, Afiya</field><field name="description">The accuracy of perception of facial emotion expressions was studied in individuals with low and high psychopathic personality characteristics in a sample of 21 male and 39 female university students. Participants completed the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI), and the Behavioural Inhibition Scale and the Behavioural Activation Scale (BIS/BAS) as measures of psychopathy. Participants completed a computerised emotion recognition task containing six emotions of facial expressions (each emotion had five different intensities). The results showed that participants scoring low on the BIS and high on the BAS scores showed significant impairments in the recognition of both sad and fearful expressions. On the other hand, group scoring high on the PPI, showed significant impairment in the recognition of angry, but not fearful or sad expressions in the total sample. Males with high psychopathic personality characteristics showed significant impairments in the recognition of sad, fearful and angry expressions compared to males with low psychopathic personality characteristics. On the other hand females with high psychopathic personality characteristics showed significant impairment in recognising the expression of disgust only compared to females with low psychopathic personality characteristics. The PPI and the BIS/BAS scales showed reasonable alpha reliabilities with some exceptions for one subscale in each measure. Correlations between the PPI and the BIS/BAS scales were weak to moderate. The current findings suggest that different dimensions of psychopathy may be associated with selective impairments in recognising unpleasant emotion expressions in others.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psychopathy</field><field name="subject">psychopathic personality characteristics</field><field name="subject">facial affect recognition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of functional assessment of the behaviour of students with adhd in a mainstream classroom</field><field name="creator">Brierly, Emerald Stevie</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this study was to replicate and extend Hoff, Ervin, and Friman (2005) and to investigate whether a functional assessment, including the intervention, could be implemented within a mainstream New Zealand classroom, with students diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and with the teachers implementing the interventions. Experiment 1 included 2 participants, Joel diagnosed as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and Brad who met study inclusion criteria. Descriptive assessments (based on interviews and observations) of the functions of the target behaviours were conducted to produce hypotheses.  Two interventions for each student, based on these hypotheses, were selected in collaboration with the class teachers. The interventions were implemented, first singularly and then in combination, using a multiple-baseline design with alternating treatments after the baseline period. They all decreased target behaviours to some degree. One intervention, the token economy, was the most effective with both students. Social acceptability questionnaires showed all procedures were acceptable but of the interventions the token economy was the least favoured by teachers and most favoured by students. Both participants in Experiment 2 were diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Experiment 2 replicated Experiment 1 and also compared hypotheses about the function of behaviour resulting from the Motivation Assessment Scale to those from the descriptive assessment as used in Experiment 1. The Motivation Assessment Scale provided a different hypothesis for one student and it is suggested that this scale is not useful with these students. The two interventions were selected for each student based on the hypotheses. These were designed to be easier to implement and to have more student involvement in their implementation than in Experiment 1. A multiple-baseline design with alternating treatments after the baseline was used and each treatment was evaluated alone. Three of the four interventions decreased target behaviour, the exception was self-management. The social acceptability scores for these interventions were high for both the teachers and students. The overall findings replicated Hoff et al.'s (2005) findings and showed that functional assessment of behaviour could be successfully used with students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in a mainstream classroom. They also showed that the teachers could successfully implement the interventions derived from the hypotheses to decrease target behaviours and that decreasing the difficulty of implementation of the interventions increased the acceptability of the interventions by the teachers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">functional assessment</field><field name="subject">classroom teachers</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="subject">ADHD</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paradoxical Performances of Subjectivities, Spaces and Art Gallery Postcards</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Christine</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relationship between art gallery postcards, subjectivities and domestic spaces. Feminist post-structuralist debates on memory, subjectivity and domestic spaces provide the theoretical framework for this research into taken-for-granted objects of the everyday. Empirical data came from interviewing nine women who buy, use and keep postcards and two New Zealand Art Gallery store managers. Some of the participants were interviewed more than once, while others extended their views by e-mail. Auto-ethnographic narrative is used to explore further the symbolic significance of an individual's postcard consumption. This research focuses attention on the production of gendered subjectivities and domestic spaces through an aesthetic artefact. There are three points to my analysis. Firstly, I argue paradoxically the under-noticed seemingly trivial gallery postcard becomes a memory holder and therefore a significant artefact of symbolic value. Memories are potent, elusive fragments that become attached to a sound, smell, touch or sight. Catching sight of a postcard can trigger a chain of memory associations, which in turn constructs a sense of self through the remembering. Secondly, I contend that subjectivity is understood as fluid and multiple, evolving out of experience and interpretation. Memories formed from experience and connections made with people, place and things become associated with gallery postcards and serve as a catalyst for personal narratives which in turn can operate as tools for constructing subjectivities. Finally I suggest that domestic spaces are a product of relations that can be understood as existing within and beyond the home. Stretched domestic space can be produced by the display of gallery postcards in office spaces. The exploration of the art gallery postcard adds to the knowledges of everyday objects and their role and significance in constructing gendered subjectivities and spaces.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gallery postcards</field><field name="subject">domestic spaces</field><field name="subject">subjectivities</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">auto ethnography</field><field name="subject">visual methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2295</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study  on Teacher Professionalism and Teacher Leadership: The Teachers' Viewpoint</field><field name="creator">Lunn, Jillian Mary</field><field name="description">This study looks at the current situation of how teachers view the concepts of teacher professionalism and teacher leadership in New Zealand primary schools. It is a small scale study located in two large city primary schools, where it was identified by others in the profession that sharing of leadership was a common practice, and that they were high performing schools. I was interested in gathering the information from teachers with a range of teaching experience, and finding out what were the common understandings surrounding these concepts. The literature reviewed shows there is an international focus on developing leadership capacity within schools. It is argued that in order to sustain the development of schools in such complex times while remaining focused on the core business of the learning of the students, leadership is an activity that all teachers should be involved in, as it is a recognized component for improving the professional role of the teacher. The study was carried out by interviewing twelve teachers who had a range of experience and held a range of leadership positions from beginning teachers through to deputy principals. The findings showed the teachers in this study understood there is a close link between their leadership and their professionalism and that one reinforced the other. The teachers were empowered to take their professional development to new heights as the school culture reinforced the collective responsibility the teachers had for school development.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teacher professionalism</field><field name="subject">teacher leadership</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vulnerability and Resilience of the Bang Luang Community to Flooding from the Chao Phraya River</field><field name="creator">Senavattanagul, Thanahathai</field><field name="description">Flooding is a natural phenomenon and in the past Thai people have adapted to flood events. However over the years land degradation, deforestation and bad urban practices have exacerbated the impact of flood disasters.  This study of flood management in Thailand shows how human activities and interventions have impacted on the river basin system.  This research focuses on the vulnerability to flood hazard of the people living or working near the Chao Phraya River. The case study is of the community living or working in the proximity of Wat Bang Luang (Bang Luang Temple) of the Pathum Thani Province, Thailand.  This research explores the capacity of communities to live with or cope with floods. Their adaptations to changes in flood regimes will depend on several factors: political (especially when Thailand has a long history of preoccupation with engineering and technological solutions as the main approach to disaster response), economic, ecological (human modification to flood plains), social (kin-based networks) and cultural factors.  The data collected from the target community showed a power struggle between Thai culture and the dominant hazard management paradigm. This research put a human face on natural disaster and looked at the issue of flooding from the experiences of ordinary people.  The findings showed that some members of the community are resilient while others are passive and are more vulnerable to floods.  However, it is important not to label any individual or group as either vulnerable or resilient as people can be both at the same time and policy makers need to build on the strengths, rather than focus on the weaknesses and on offering emergency relief.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flooding</field><field name="subject">Vulnerability</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Pathum Thani</field><field name="subject">Hazard management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2297</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Suspended solid levels in two chemically dosed sediment retention ponds during earthworks at SH20, Auckland</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Kate Maree</field><field name="description">Earthworking activities have the potential to accelerate soil erosion through vegetation clearance and soil compaction processes. The eroded sediment can have many detrimental effects on receiving aquatic environments, and thus its discharge is controlled under the Resource Management Act, 1991. Two chemically dosed sediment retentions ponds at the SH20 extension project in Mount Roskill, Auckland were investigated, and the impact of the discharge of one of these ponds on a receiving waterbody was assessed using the Stream Ecological Valuation (SEV) method.  Rainfall and suspended solid data was collected for a nine month period between November 2006 and August 2007, although sampling did not commence at one of the ponds until March 2007. Two SEV samples were undertaken within the receiving waterbody; one in November 2006 and the other in November 2007 to assess environmental changes resulting from the sediment retention pond discharge.  The suspended solids results measured within the sediment retention ponds during this study were much lower than those reported by other studies on earthwork sites. This is believed to be due to the effective implementation of sediment and erosion control measures onsite.  The Somerset Road pond was very effective at removing suspended solids throughout the sampling period, with the majority of suspended solid removal occurring in the forebay as it typically did not become full enough to overflow into the main pond. When the forebay was full of water, the PAC dosing system resulted in large reductions in suspended solid levels over a short horizontal distance within the forebay. A smaller amount of suspended solid reduction was achieved in the main pond, predominately through dilution, with the major function of the main pond being additional storage capacity for runoff. Discharge from the Somerset Road Pond was not continuous due to low water levels in the main pond. However, when discharge did occur, the suspended solids levels were very low compared with other studies investigating sediment retention pond discharge.  The Richardson Road pond was less effective at removing suspended solids due to the flow regime within the forebay. There were two runoff channels entering the forebay, as well as a continual flow of groundwater. Only one of the runoff channels was directly dosed with PAC, and as the water level in the forebay was typically at, or just below, the level spreader at all times, there was a decreased potential for the PAC to become evenly distributed through the forebay and achieve dosing of all runoff. Furthermore, the main pond discharged continuously during the study period, resulting in reduced residence times of runoff within the pond system. Nonetheless, the discharge from the main pond was much lower than other studies, implying suspended solid reduction was being achieved.  The SEV method indicated that the receiving environment was already degraded due to modifications to the riparian vegetation, increased dissolved oxygen demand, and moderate bank erosion. This was reflected in the macroinvertebrate population, with only pollution tolerant taxa being collected, thus limiting the use of macroinvertebrates as an assessment tool in this study. However, the SEV method, which assesses a wide range of ecological functions, implied that very little environmental change occurred as a result of the sediment retention pond discharge. A small increase in deposited sediment was observed on the stream bed, however indications are that deposited sediment is rapidly washed away once earthworks are completed. Thus this deposited sediment may not have a permanent impact within the receiving environment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polyaluminium chloride</field><field name="subject">sediment retention pond</field><field name="subject">earthworks</field><field name="subject">chemical dosing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2298</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experiences of Tongan Women Migrants at Paid Work in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Fa'anunu, Sinama Tupou</field><field name="description">The employment experiences of Tongan women migrants have received little attention in the literature.  This study therefore, sought to shed light on the dynamics of their social and economic experiences at paid work in New Zealand.  It was guided by the theories of population geographies, feminist geography and postcolonialism.  The inter-relationships of these theories provided insights into the influence of migration on these women's identities, ethnicity and gender relations and also how these influence these women's experiences at paid work in New Zealand.  The data were drawn from two major sources: i) the New Zealand 2006 population census and ii) in-depth interviews held in Tonga and New Zealand, with greater focus on the interviews.  This study revealed that the Tongan women's decisions for migrating to New Zealand were influenced by social rather than economic incentives.  Migration has challenged these women's traditional roles and reconstructed their gender relations.  Many are breadwinners yet Tongan born men in New Zealand still predominantly engage in the labour force and have higher personal income.  Their experiences at paid work also differ from the New Zealand born Tongan women in New Zealand.  These differences reflect the availability of their social networks and their familiarity with the socio-economic systems in New Zealand.

They were influential throughout the 'feminist movement' of the 1960s and 1970s and Wollstonecraft is routinely given the title of 'mother' of feminism.  One result of her works being classified as important feminist texts is the elision of the religious element in her works.  Moreover, recent scholarship has drawn attention to the central importance of religion in eighteenth century British discourse.  This thesis will primarily argue that Wollstonecraft was heavily influenced by religion, and that her writings were conceived in response to a profoundly theologico-political culture.  This influence of religion has generally been overlooked by researchers and this thesis will aim to redress this absence.  Four of Wollstonecraft's works - all produced within a 'similar' political climate and within a concise time period - are utilized to show that religion was a foundational element within Wollstonecraft's thought and arguments.  This thesis shows that Wollstonecraft was not so much a 'feminist' thinker, but a unique intellectual determined to show that the inferior position of women went against 'God's will', teachings and the equality He had ascribed to both men and women during Creation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Religion</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">Mary Wollstonecraft</field><field name="subject">eighteenth century Britain</field><field name="subject">Edmund Burke</field><field name="subject">Richard Price</field><field name="subject">Enlightenment</field><field name="subject">Romanticism</field><field name="subject">God</field><field name="subject">equality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflectivity Measurement System Development and Calibration</field><field name="creator">Peng, Tao</field><field name="description">Accurate assessment of road luminance provided by overhead streetlights helps to optimize the visibility of objects on the road and therefore promotes driver safety, while minimizing energy consumption.

In this thesis, an investigation into the prototype system has been conducted and further enhancement and redesign has been done. A portable on-site road surface reflectivity measurement system that complies with the Commission Internationale de I' Eclairage (CIE) standard was developed. The road test of this new system has been carried out on a series of Hamilton city roads.

Gisborne could experience gt;500 fatalities and extensive damage to infrastructure during a severe tsunami.  The severity of a tsunami is likely to be low for distance sources given the effectiveness of the Pacific Tsunami Warning System. However, there is a substantial risk from local sources, as no local warning system of any kind exists.  Prompt evacuation is probably the most cost-effective tsunami mitigation strategy available for New Zealand coastal locations, including Gisborne. This requires both knowledge of the extent of tsunami inundation, and sufficient warning of the tsunami arrival. Hence, there are two main objectives for this investigation:  1.	Determine the likely extent of tsunami inundation for Gisborne City and surrounding populated coastal locations in Poverty Bay, using a combination of hydrodynamic tsunami modelling and GIS. The modelling will simulate historical events, particularly the largest historical tsunami, the May 1947 local tsunami.

The overall aim of this research project was to evaluate, using a range of effectiveness criteria, the processes involved in the creation of a marae-based te reo M&#257;ori regeneration strategy in the hope that others involved in similar projects in the future would benefit and in the hope that the Whakam&#257;rama wh&#257;nau will themselves derive benefit from it in reviewing what has already been achieved. In Chapter 1, the background to the research project and its rationale are outlined and the research questions and research methods are introduced. Chapter 2 provides a critical review of selected literature in the area of strategic planning aspects of language regeneration and relevant aspects of m&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori. Using an ethnographic approach, the processes and immediate outcomes (in terms of a survey report and a regeneration plan for Whakam&#257;rama marae) of the language regeneration project are outlined in Chapter 3. In Chapter 4, effectiveness criteria are derived on the basis of the literature review in Chapter 2. These include criteria relating to leadership, participation, Kaupapa M&#257;ori values, environmental analysis and outcomes. The criteria are then applied to the analysis and evaluation of the processes and outcomes outlined in Chapter 3 in order to identify their strengths and weaknesses. The overall conclusion is that Whakam&#257;rama's language regeneration activities to date can be regarded as successful in many ways, including the fact that they have resulted in the production of high quality documentation that is widely appreciated by the wh&#257;nau in the form of a maraebased language survey and a marae-based te reo M&#257;ori regeneration plan. Working voluntarily and often under difficult circumstances, core group members demonstrated that they possessed the essential characteristics of commitment, motivation and determination, in addition to the willingness and ability to use existing skills and knowledge effectively and to develop further skills and knowledge as the project proceeded. Perhaps most important, they developed a caring and effective working culture. However, the weaknesses of the project included a lack of preparation and planning prior to the commencement of the project which resulted in a build up of work at a number of stages. This, in turn, lead to delays in producing outcomes and some loss of momentum. It also led, indirectly, to the views of two or three members of the core group being overrepresented in the reo plan goals. The information and analysis provided here have relevance to any language community involved in micro-level language regeneration activities of a similar type. It is hoped therefore that this thesis may help others to not only avoid the problems experienced by the Whakam&#257;rama wh&#257;nau but also to benefit from their successes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">critical success factors</field><field name="subject">diglossia</field><field name="subject">ethnographic research</field><field name="subject">intergenerational transmission</field><field name="subject">kaupapa Maori research</field><field name="subject">language planning</field><field name="subject">language regeneration</field><field name="subject">language revitalisation</field><field name="subject">language regeneration planning</field><field name="subject">language revitalisation planning</field><field name="subject">Maori language</field><field name="subject">Maori language planning</field><field name="subject">Maori language regeneration</field><field name="subject">Maori language revitalisation</field><field name="subject">Maori language regeneration planning</field><field name="subject">Maori language regeneration strategy</field><field name="subject">Micro level language planning</field><field name="subject">Marae based language survey</field><field name="subject">national language policy</field><field name="subject">strategic planning</field><field name="subject">rautaki reo maori</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Narratives of ageing: experiences of older women</field><field name="creator">Ridley, Sally Fenwick</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to contribute to the growing body of academic literature regarding older women's stories of ageing. The initial impetus for the thesis came out of the disparity I observed between the way old women were often portrayed and the way older ageing was being lived by women I knew.  Six women were recruited using an age range of 65 years and over and an association with a particular community organisation as recruitment guides. Two methods of data collection were used: diaries and semi-structured interviews. A qualitative narrative approach was taken to the data collection and analysis.  The analysis revealed that the women viewed their ageing in a positive light. They constructed themselves as family orientated, as being and having friends and as active, independent participants within their own lives. Participants had clear ideas and expectations surrounding what they wanted from community participation and life in general. They spoke of the expectations of others and how these expectations sometimes lead to ageism and discrimination. Despite this it was apparent that being older had brought with it, for them, confidence, freedom, self-awareness and assertiveness. In short, these women required, actively sought, and usually accomplished, control of their own lives which involved places to go, people to see, things to do and most importantly the right to make their own choices.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ageing</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Participation</field><field name="subject">Choice</field><field name="subject">Control</field><field name="subject">Community</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Students' Perceptions of the Secondary Numeracy Project</field><field name="creator">Thereesha, Fathimath</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the perceptions and experiences of twenty four Year 9 students from two schools in New Zealand who had participated in the Secondary Numeracy Project. The two schools were in their first year of SNP at the time of data collection. The main focus was on four areas of mathematics learning: group work, equipment, communication and teachers. Data was collected mainly by using semi-structured and clinical interviews. Findings revealed that equipment was particularly important and were used more frequently by students in Low ability group. Students liked using equipment, working in groups and sharing multiple solutions. However, communication was not used much as a means of making sense of mathematics in these classrooms. Furthermore the students' responses depended on the ability groups. These findings complemented the work of other researchers who have explored students' perspectives at the primary level. These findings suggest that the SNP would be more successful if students were explicitly taught good communication and cooperative learning skills.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Secondary Numeracy Project</field><field name="subject">Mathematics Education</field><field name="subject">group work</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">secondary school</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reporting Death and Disaster:  The Paradox beyond the Numbers</field><field name="creator">Courtney, Claire</field><field name="description">The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami killed over two hundred thousand people in the fifteen countries the tsunami struck.

Challenges facing Pacific communities: The case of Fijians in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Vunidilo, Kalisito</field><field name="description">Living in two worlds is an insider perspective of how indigenous Pacific Immigrant communities, in this specific case Fijian's living in New Zealand face the challenges of living two cultures in a developed country like New Zealand.  The quest to hold on to one's indigenous culture while adapting to another, in order to survive the realities of everyday circumstances can be a complicated struggle. The main objective of this research was to collate and analyze information from Fijian families who migrated to New Zealand from 1970's to the mid 1980's with reference to the challenges they faced.  In order to understand such constant struggles there are underlying questions and factors that should be considered.  For example - why do people continue to be conservative about their cultural identities or how do they react to unfamiliar challenges in a multicultural society.  Another could be - what influences have been seen in order for their children to recognize their indigenous identity.  Comparable factors that will bring to other aspects of living in two worlds which would be considered were socio-economic issues, higher education, technological advancement, immigration policies, development constraints and quality of living standards.  Fijians and other indigenous Pacific people have through the years gained the ultimate will to defend their cultural and traditional identity whilst living in a world of western values and culture.  Coupled with this have been the complexities of holding on to the values of both worlds.  As this project probed into these newly rediscovered stories about journeys to their new homeland filled with opportunities, capitalism or westernization had never withered their passion and dreams as Pacific people to better themselves.  They also enjoyed the luxury of both worlds as conservators of Pacific cultures and exploiters of technological advancement filled with huge dreams, opportunities and better standards of living. Fijians have the smallest population of Pacific people in New Zealand when compared to Samoa, Tonga, and Cook Islanders.  There were relatively small number of Fijians who arrived after the end of World War 2 and they were basically employed in farms, forestry work stations and industrial areas.  Others were in New Zealand on government scholarships, training or internship and work experience programs. Most of these people returned home while a very small proportion stayed behind.  In the early 1970's and 1980's there was also an influx of seasonal workers in the Central North Island areas including Hawkes Bay, Tokoroa and the Waikato region.  Most people were recruited from the Pacific Islands including Fiji because of their hard working attitude and cheap labour margins.  When their term was completed some decided to stay and work, eventually residing legally and permanently with their families.  Another group of men came via Wellington by boat, destined to become maintenance and repair workers. (bound for maintenance and repair work and ) but were left stranded when the shipping company ownership changed.  The dock and maritime workers union fought for the case stating the government on humanitarian grounds should provide them with employment and residency status.  After an extensive legal struggle, which lasted almost seven years these early Fijian workers and their families were granted work and residency permits.  The (remaining) other families came as visitors or through marriage links and were granted work and residency permits.  The 1996 statistics (Statistics New Zealand, Census 1996) stated that Fijians were the most highly skilled and educated Pacific Island population in New Zealand.  These statistics had been directly influenced by the latest influx of well educated and highly qualified Fijians who arrived in the late 1990's.  The research will also highlight whether those who arrived before this latest influx faced the same challenges.  These challenges will be compared to those faced by the generation of Fijians and Pacific people who were born and bred in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fijians</field><field name="subject">Pacific</field><field name="subject">comparative study of Pacific people</field><field name="subject">Pacific identity</field><field name="subject">Fijian culture and tradition</field><field name="subject">indigenous issues</field><field name="subject">challenges facing immigrant communities</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Indigenous Knowledge in Biodiversity Conservation: Implications for Conservation Education in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Tiu, Sangion Appiee</field><field name="description">The research reported in this thesis focussed on exploring existing indigenous environmental knowledge of two indigenous communities in Papua New Guinea and how this knowledge was acquired, interpreted and disseminated to the next generation. The relevance of indigenous environmental knowledge in the promotion of biodiversity conservation efforts was investigated.  This research was conducted within an interpretive paradigm. A naturalistic/ethnographic methodology was used. Data was collected through semi structured interviews and observations. Participants in this case study were representatives of the community and included elders, adults, teachers and students.  The findings in this study revealed indigenous environmental knowledge as useful for biodiversity conservation and promotes sustainable practices. It showed that indigenous family knowledge is essential for claiming land inheritance and indigenous environmental practices are consistent with sustainable practices and land use. Forest knowledge is found to be useful in identifying and locating resources and that sustainable practices ensured continuity of these resources. The study also identified spiritual knowledge and beliefs as fundamental for developing indigenous worldviews and environmental attitudes and values and that change in resource use may be both beneficial and harmful to biodiversity. The findings also revealed indigenous education as flexible, holistic and informal in nature and uses mostly oral history through verbal instruction and various non-verbal means. They showed that IE uses a variety of teaching and learning approaches that utilise the environment as a tool and that learning venues provide a realistic learning experience. The thesis concludes that IEK promotes biodiversity conservation in many ways and that indigenous education uses situated context to promote realistic learning.  Indigenous environmental knowledge and education could therefore be used in biodiversity conservation education.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">conservation education</field><field name="subject">indigneous knowledge</field><field name="subject">indigenous environmental knowledge</field><field name="subject">indigenous education</field><field name="subject">biodiversity conservation</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Chronic Pain: An Evaluation of the Self-Help Book, Living Beyond Your Pain</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Marnie Ruth</field><field name="description">The current research was a randomised two group (control and treatment) study that evaluated the effectiveness of an ACT-based self-help book for people with chronic pain.  Over a 6-week period, 6 participants read the book and completed exercises from it with weekly telephone support while 8 others waited.  Five of these others began the intervention after a 6-week control period.  Participants completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires for acceptance, values illness, quality of life, satisfaction with life, depression, anxiety and pain.  Initial outcome data were collected for 8 control participants and 6 intervention participants.  A total of 11 participants completed pre- and post-intervention measures.  Participants' who read the book, rated the content of the book each week according to reading level and usefulness, and their comprehension of the content was also assessed.  Original group data showed statistically significant improvement in acceptance and quality of life for those who completed the intervention.  Once the data were pooled, statistically significant improvements in acceptance, quality of life, satisfaction with life, and values illness were found.  In general, using the self-help book did not result in reduced pain, depression or anxiety, although for some individuals gains were made in these areas.  Individual perceptions of the book components were varied but findings suggest that cognitive defusion and mindfulness were parts of the book that participants found hard.  The current findings support the hypothesis that using the self-help book would add value to the lives of people who experience chronic pain.  Thus, the book may be a useful tool for people who experience chronic pain.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acceptance and Commitment Therapy</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Chronic Pain</field><field name="subject">bibliotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2309</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personalising Learning: Exploring the principles and processes of the IEP for young, gifted readers</field><field name="creator">Mazza-Davies, Laurie Lynn</field><field name="description">This small-scale qualitative, action research study sought to establish the efficacy of using the Individualised Education Programme (IEP) as an assistive tool towards the differentiation of reading programmes for young, gifted and talented readers. Despite a growing awareness about the importance of curriculum differentiation for all students, research indicates how little some classroom teachers do to meet the needs of gifted readers.  The literature reviewed reveals how the prolonged mismatching of instructional reading programmes to the academic and emotional maturity of the gifted reader may well result in underachievement, and a diminished opportunity to learn how to react to challenge.  In November 2006, the New Zealand Ministry of Education launched its personalising learning initiative, which promotes the active participation of students in their education by creating their own learning pathways.  Students are encouraged to articulate their learning needs and preferences, and set goals in collaboration with their parents and family/whanau and teachers.  With its underlying principles based on collaboration and communication, together with its seemingly flexible structure, this study utilised the IEP as a personalising learning framework for young gifted and talented readers, and as a differentiation tool for their teachers. Over a five month period, the researcher worked alongside three Year Two/Three teachers from an urban, decile five primary school as they each identified one gifted reader from their classes, and together with the student and the student's parents, set about planning and implementing an IEP, using strategies and approaches suggested by the literature as the most apposite for gifted readers.  Data was gathered through in-class observations, participants' journals, focus group meetings, IEP meetings, and semi-structured interviews.  This study reveals the use of the IEP holds great promise as a differentiation tool towards the personalisation of learning programmes for young, gifted readers.  Each student attended his or her own IEP meetings, indicated their learning preferences and needs, helped to set his or her own learning goals, and assessed their own achievement using the IEP goal indicators.  Significantly, for the teachers involved in this project, the IEPs proved not only useful as qualitatively differentiated planning frameworks for the students in the study, but many of the goals and strategies used proved pertinent for all children, in particular, for the 'top' reading groups.  In this regard, IEPs proved to be 'work-smarter' tools for the teachers involved, serving as planning blueprints for the most able readers in their classes, thereby creating inclusive rather than exclusive conditions for the gifted readers.  Furthermore, the insights gained by the teachers involved into the needs of their gifted readers ultimately challenged their personal teaching philosophies, and resulted in changes to their teaching practices for their gifted students.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personalising learning</field><field name="subject">Individualised Education Plan</field><field name="subject">IEP</field><field name="subject">gifted readers</field><field name="subject">curriculum differentiation</field><field name="subject">reading</field><field name="subject">individualised</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ozone Depletion and Global Warming</field><field name="creator">Fow, Alista John</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis examines global warming and the possible contribution that ozone depletion provides to this warming. An examination is performed to determine the extent of any warming/cooling events within the Earth-atmosphere system. The change in energy corresponding to this warning of the Earth- atmosphere system is estimated as being equivilent to an increase of mean solar input of 0.22W/m2. This is compared to the predicted changes of solar input for the two most common global warming scenarios: greenhouse gases and solar irradiance variance; and for a less well explored scenario, snow-ice albedo change. Examination of ozone depletion data shows that an absence of ozone in the stratosphere produces an increase in UV-B radiation at the surface of the Earth. This increase in UV-B light has not previously been thourougly examined in any of the global warming scenarios. This is presented as a fourth scenario for global warming. An analytical three layer model of the Earth-atmosphere, based on an earlier two layer model, is developed. Using this model it is determined that greenhouse gases, solar irradiance, snow-ice albedo feedback and ozone depletion can cause warming of the Earth's atmosphere. After comparison with other models, a snow-ice albedo mechanism is incorporated into the three layer model. This produces an amplification effect of any warming that occurs. Compared to the observed increase of surface temperature between 1975-2000 of 0.55 K, the model using a snow-ice albedo feedback, produced an increase of temperature of 1.4 K for greenhouse gases, 0.294 K for a solar irradiance increase and 0.119 K caused by a decrease in the ozone layer. Of the greenhouse gas, solar irradiance and ozone depletion scenarios, ozone depletion demonstrates the most realistic relative changes with a cooling of the stratosphere and a warming of the troposphere and Earth's surface as has been observed. It is concluded that ozone depletion is likely for a reasonable part of observed global warming.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ozone Depletion</field><field name="subject">Global Warming</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metadata Quality for Digital Libraries</field><field name="creator">Chan, Chu-hsiang</field><field name="description">The quality of metadata in a digital library is an important factor in ensuring access for end-users.

This is the first study focusing on the application of the ARMIDILO by using comparative current risk assessment tests to evaluate the ARMIDILO as an effective risk assessment tool.  In this research 16 ID people who have recorded sexual and or violent behaviour offences were evaluated using the Violent Offender Risk Assessment Scale (VORAS), Static-99 and ARMIDILO risk assessment tests. The ARMIDILO, VORAS and Static-99 assessments were completed using individual history files kept within the Regional Forensic Psychiatric Service. The VORAS and Static-99 were adapted to incorporate reported, but not charged or otherwise litigated offences and convictions. The adapted tests were then compared against the ARMIDILO as a risk assessment tool. Analysis of the ARMIDILO showed strong validity in assessing ID people who offend. The main strength of the ARMIDILO is in identifying the risk needs of the ID person who offends and may be an effective management test when used in assessing individual needs and program implementation. Risk assessment through the ARMIDILO showed similar results to Static-99 but compared only moderately with the VORAS in measuring the risk of re-offending. Future research with a larger population may further validate the reliability of the ARMIDILO as an assessment tool.

In order to investigate the presence and role of addiction features in disorders outside of substance addictions, symptoms of addiction were explored within three addiction groups: alcohol dependence (AD), an established addiction (n = 24); pathological gambling (PG) a disorder with growing empirical support as an addiction (n = 20); and compulsive shopping (CS), a proposed 'novel' addiction(n = 20). Participants were recruited from either the general population, or from the Auckland Salvation Army Bridge residential alcohol and drug treatment programme; Salvation Army Oasis Gambling Service; Pacific Peoples Addiction Service Incorporated; or Te Kahui Hauora O Ngati Koata Trust. Participants completed a battery of self-report measures comprising a demographics questionnaire; Addictive Disorder Questionnaire (ADQ); anxiety and depression subscales of the Symptom Checklist 90 Revised (SCL-90R); Barratt Impulsivity Scale II-r; and substance specific adaptations of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Three general categories of addiction symptoms: physiological, salience and dyscontrol, were identified as broad aspects of addiction, common across all three groups. Measurable aspects of addiction, including impulsivity, obsessions, anxiety and depression were found to be endorsed similarly across the three addictions, irrespective of the severity of their addiction. Compulsions were found to be higher in the AD group. Higher anxiety was found to be correlated with higher addiction in the behavioural addictions (CS and PG), whereas depression and anxiety were associated with higher addiction severity in the AD group. The results provide support for broadening addiction diagnostic definitions, to be more encompassing of the psychological and physiological experiences of each symptom; and developing different diagnostic categories for non-substance addictions that reflect the severity of the addiction. Results also provide evidence for developmental phases of addiction, from an early 'hedonistic' impulsive phase, to a compulsive phase, in which increased dyscontrol, mood and anxiety, marks the severity of the addiction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Addiction</field><field name="subject">Gambling</field><field name="subject">Alcohol Dependence</field><field name="subject">Compulsive Shopping</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effective Linear-Time Feature Selection</field><field name="creator">Pradhananga, Nripendra</field><field name="description">The classification learning task requires selection of a subset of features to represent patterns to be classified. This is because the performance of the classifier and the cost of classification are sensitive to the choice of the features used to construct the classifier. Exhaustive search is impractical since it searches every possible combination of features. The runtime of heuristic and random searches are better but the problem still persists when dealing with high-dimensional datasets. We investigate a heuristic, forward, wrapper-based approach, called Linear Sequential Selection, which limits the search space at each iteration of the feature selection process. We introduce randomization in the search space. The algorithm is called Randomized Linear Sequential Selection. Our experiments demonstrate that both methods are faster, find smaller subsets and can even increase the classification accuracy. We also explore the idea of ensemble learning. We have proposed two ensemble creation methods, Feature Selection Ensemble and Random Feature Ensemble. Both methods apply a feature selection algorithm to create individual classifiers of the ensemble. Our experiments have shown that both methods work well with high-dimensional data.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">filter</field><field name="subject">wrapper</field><field name="subject">feature selection</field><field name="subject">attribute selection</field><field name="subject">ensemble learning</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Linear Feature Selection</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drug Rehabilitation and Practice Dilemmas in the Maldives</field><field name="creator">Ageel, Ihsana</field><field name="description">Abstract  Substance misuse is a global phenomenon. However, little is known about substance misuse issues in Islamic nations or about the provision of preventative and rehabilitative services in such nations. This thesis explores the legal context of such services in the Maldives and pays particular attention to tensions between the formal policies of the National Narcotics Control Bureau and clinical practice. Findings are drawn from a review of government and service policy documents, five semi-structured individual interviews with clinical practitioners and senior administrative staff from rehabilitative services, and a three day focus group workshop with clinical staff. Findings show the lack of awareness of the legal and policy contexts for service provision and the ways in which existing policy frameworks often detract from the forging of therapeutic alliances. The primary concern raised by the analysis is the lack of involvement of clinical staff in policy formation and revision. This contributes to series of tensions and contradictions between official aims for services and the actual provision of these services. Further a range of ethical issues arose as a result of inadequate professional monitoring, training, and peer review. Recommendations are made regarding how these issues should be addressed in order to enhance the Maldivian response to increasing substance misuse.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">substance abuse</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">therapeutic alliance</field><field name="subject">practioner-practice gap</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Best-first Decision Tree Learning</field><field name="creator">Shi, Haijian</field><field name="description">In best-first top-down induction of decision trees, the best split is added in each step (e.g. the split that maximally reduces the Gini index).

A social studies exemplar is a sample of authentic student work annotated to illustrate learning, achievement and quality in relation to levels 1- 5 of Social Studies in the New Zealand Curriculum (SSNZC, 1997). The aim of the research was to support teachers to implement the social studies curriculum exemplars in informed ways by encouraging and promoting the use of the social studies exemplars as models of quality  social studies teaching. This small scale qualitative research was undertaken by a syndicate of four Years 5/6 teachers and the researcher. The four primary teachers assumed roles of teacher-researchers and worked together collegially with the researcher within a community of practice to co-construct the research process. The research involved incorporating aspects of the exemplars into their social studies programmes during 2006. The community of practice engaged in regular collegial conversations relating to the exemplars. Three of these narratives were taped semi-structured conversations captured in situ. Transcripts of student-teacher conversations were collected, analysed and commented upon to provide some information about student learning outcomes in relation to the exemplars. The notion of reciprocity underpinned this research, since it involved the researcher being willing to contribute to the research in return for the teachers' time and involvement in the study. The support and guidance provided by the researcher was provided as an outcome of her experience in teaching social studies for the School of Education. The research takes into account contemporary ideas about learning and teaching theory, as well as the nature of social studies pedagogy. It examines the implications of sociocultural processes for learning with its emphasis on interaction and collaborative learning iv environments. The research context and the methodology were informed by new understandings about the empowerment of teachers implementing their own professional development and conducting research into their own practice. This research makes a contribution to the field of social studies curriculum and wider professional contexts by informing pre-service teachers' understandings of the intent and use of the New Zealand Ministry of Education's social studies curriculum exemplars. Additionally, it supports in-service social studies professional development, illustrates processes around communities of practice and exemplifies social studies pedagogy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social studies pedagogy</field><field name="subject">communities of practice</field><field name="subject">exemplars</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">teacher research</field><field name="subject">social studies education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution of small mammals in five New Zealand forest habitats</field><field name="creator">Watkins, Alison Fern</field><field name="description">This project aimed to reanalyse two large historical data sets from two different locations in New Zealand (Fiordland in the South Island and Pureora Forest Park in the North Island). The data describe populations of mice (Mus musculus), rats (Rattus rattus and R. norvegicus), and stoats (Mustela erminea) collected using standard monitoring techniques from five distinct types of forest habitat. The new analysis methods selected were an index of patchiness and Site Occupancy analysis.  The objectives of the analysis were (1) to evaluate whether the patchiness index and Site Occupancy analysis methods might contribute to improved protocols for monitoring small mammal populations in the future, and (2) to use formal tests of five hypotheses to evaluate two of the assumptions made by the conventional density index often used in small mammal studies.  I describe the results of the analyses for each species, including any problems encountered (such as the inability of the Site Occupancy method to analyse very sparse data sets). I also describe the results pooled from each of the two study locations and potential consequences for small mammal monitoring and control.  This analysis has suggested that in most cases the density index is not a rigorous measure of small mammal populations. However, both the index of patchiness and Site Occupancy analysis provided useful, new information about these populations of rodents and stoats, despite the fact that these historical data sets were not designed for use with modern methods of analysis.

Because of its high hydrogen content and low molecular weight ammonia borane has the potential to meet stringent gravimetric hydrogen storage targets of gt;9 wt%. Two of the three moles of H2 in ammonia borane can be released under relatively mild conditions, with the highest gravimetric yield obtained in the solid-state. However, ammonia borane does not deliver sufficient H2 at practical temperatures and the products formed upon H2 loss are not amenable to regeneration back to the parent compound.  The literature synthesis of ammonia borane was modified to facilitate large scale synthesis, and the deuterated analogues ND3BH3 and NH3BD3 were prepared for the purpose of mechanistic studies.  The effect of lithium amide on the kinetics of dehydrogenation of ammonia borane was assessed by means of solid-state reaction in a series of specific molar ratios. Upon mixing lithium amide and ammonia borane, an exothermic reaction ensued resulting in the formation of a weakly bound adduct with an H2N...BH3-NH3 environment. Thermal decomposition at or above temperatures of 50eg;C of this phase was shown to liberate gt;9 wt% H2. The mechanism of hydrogen evolution was investigated by means of reacting lithium amide and deuterated ammonia borane isotopologues, followed by analysis of the isotopic composition of evolved gaseous products by mass spectrometry. From these results, an intermolecular multi-step reaction mechanism was proposed, with the rates of the first stage strongly dependent on the concentration of lithium amide present. Compounds exhibiting a BN3 environment (identified by means of solid-state sup1;sup1;B NMR spectroscopy) were formed during the first stage, and subsequently cross link to form a non-volatile solid. Further heating of this non-volatile solid phase ultimately resulted in the formation of crystalline Li3BN2 - identified by means of powder X-ray diffractometry. This compound has been identified as a potential hydrogen storage material due to its lightweight and theoretically high hydrogen content. It may also be amenable to hydrogen re-absorption.  The LiNH2/CH3NH2BH3 system was also investigated. Thermal decomposition occurred through the same mechanism described for the LiNH2/NH3BH3 system to theoretically evolve gt;8 wt% hydrogen. The gases evolved on thermal decomposition were predominantly H2 with traces of methane detected by mass spectrometry.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ammonia borane</field><field name="subject">Hydrogen storage</field><field name="subject">Hydrogen</field><field name="subject">methylamine borane</field><field name="subject">lithium amide</field><field name="subject">11B NMR</field><field name="subject">solid-state NMR</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A M&#257;ori Perspective of Wh&#257;nau and Childrearing in the 21st Century Case Study</field><field name="creator">Morehu, Colleen</field><field name="description">Ng&#257; Kupu Whakataki: Abstract  The study focuses on identifying how the reconstruction of the wh&#257;nau and its approach to childrearing through the colonisation of M&#257;ori society can be perceived within the experiences of the case study of four generations of one wh&#257;nau.

In response, one New Zealand primary school created a Boys' Project.  It encompassed a range of interventions designed to address boys' underachievement by re-culturing the school to make it a more positive environment for them.  This qualitative research is a case study of this school and it seeks to identify elements of school culture that support boys' learning.  The literature revealed contrasting and conflicting theoretical perspectives contributing to the debate around boys' achievement.  From one perspective it is accepted that boys and girls are different and schools are expected to accommodate these differences.  The alternative perspective suggests that differences between girls and boys should not be viewed as inevitable and that, for boys, schools and society should work to change undesirable attitudes and behaviours if their learning needs are to be addressed.  The research revealed that boys' underachievement is indeed a complex issue that is unlikely to be solved by short-term interventions or strategies.  The research concludes that educational outcomes for boys will be positively affected by a school culture that fosters strong relationships, a focus on learning, and an understanding of how beliefs and attitudes about gender are influential on learning.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">boys</field><field name="subject">school culture</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">underachievement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heavy Metal Contamination from Landfills in Coastal Marine Sediments:  Kiribati and New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Redfern, Farran Mack</field><field name="description">Landfill leachates are a concern in the Pacific Region where they may contribute contaminants to the coastal marine environment.  Poor waste management and pollution of coastal waters are amongst the major environmental problems in Kiribati, particularly in South Tarawa.  An investigation of areas adjacent to coastal landfill sites; Betio, Kiribati and Auckland, New Zealand was undertaken.  The Kiribati case study investigated metal contamination in marine sediments at an operational landfill while the New Zealand study was adjacent to a coastal landfill decommissioned in the 1970s. Surficial sediments (top 15 cm) were collected along transects.  At both the New Zealand and Kiribati sites, 3 transects adjacent to the landfill and 1 control transect were sampled.  The sediments were analyzed for particle size distribution, organic matter content, and Cd, As, Cr, Cu, Pb, Hg, Ni and Zn concentrations.  The pH was also measured.  The Kiribati study site had a groundwater pH of 7.14 - 8.85, and sediment materials were dominated by sand with a low organic matter content (1.60 - 2.21 %). At the Kiribati sites Cd, As, and Ni were below the detection limits.  The Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations were lower at the Kiribati control transect than the landfill transects.  Cr level decreased away from the landfill indicating the landfill as a possible source.  However, Cu and Zn did not show any distribution pattern suggesting other potential sources (port and shipwrecks) may have contributed to the elevated levels.  At the Kiribati landfill and control transects the Cr, As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn concentration were below the Effects Range-Low (ERL) and the threshold Effects levels (TEL) of the Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQCs) of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, indicating no potential adverse ecological effects on the biota.  At the Kiribati control site the Cr, As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni and Zn concentrations were within the background ranges published for clean reef sediment but the concentration at the landfill transects exceeded the background ranges. The concentration of mercury at both the control and landfill transects in Kiribati exceeded the Effects Range-Median (ERM) and the Probable Effects Level (PEL) of the SQGs indicating potential adverse ecological effects on the local benthic communities.  The New Zealand study site sediments had a pH of 6.22 - 7.24, and comprised up to 90 % clay/silt, with an organic matter content of 5 - 22 %.  At the New Zealand landfill transects Arsenic concentrations decreased away from the landfill indicating the landfill as a possible source.  Other metals such as Cr did not show a pattern of distribution along the transects, or with depth, suggesting that the landfill was not the only source of these metals.  There was a weak correlation between organic matter content, particle size distribution, and metal enrichment.  At the New Zealand site, there were no marked differences in metal concentrations between the landfill and control transects suggesting the landfill was not the only source of metals and that the wider urban or industrial run-off may have contributed.  All the metal concentrations, except Hg and Zn, exceeded the ERL and the TEL values indicating the potential for adverse ecological effects of metals on the benthic communities.  At the New Zealand site the Hg and Zn concentrations exceeded both the ERM and PEL of the SQGs and are considered highly contaminated.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Landfill leachate</field><field name="subject">heavy metals</field><field name="subject">sediment contamination</field><field name="subject">Pacific Islands</field><field name="subject">coastal marine environment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing statistical literacy with students and teachers in the secondary mathematics classroom</field><field name="creator">Doyle, Philip Gerard</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the teaching of statistical literacy in the first two years of secondary school mathematics.  The teachers involved in the research aim to make changes to classroom practice in the teaching and learning of statistics and statistical literacy in response to changes in the New Zealand curriculum.  An action research methodology is adopted by the research.  A group of three teachers and the author undertake an action research cycle of planning, observing, acting and reflecting in three different Year 9 and 10 mathematics classrooms.  The research documents the designing and implementing of strategies by a group of teachers in a mathematics department for integrating statistical literacy into teaching programmes.  The research adopts framework for improving practice that utilise models for statistical literacy and thinking and principles for teaching with a language learning or literacy focus.  Data is collected through discussions with teachers, observations of lessons and interviews with teachers and students.  Themes emerge from the data.  They include the significance of teacher and student concepts of statistics and statistical literacy, the importance of language and literacy in the statistics classroom, the adoption of teaching principles to facilitate statistical literacy and the challenge of adopting a critical literacy stance in the statistics classroom.  The study highlights the importance of literacy and language skills in statistical literacy.  The research concludes that the important changes needed for developing statistical literacy are about classroom methodology rather than content knowledge and shows that adoption of language learning principles into the teaching programme may achieve this.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">statistics education</field><field name="subject">statistical literacy</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Body Image and Eating Attitudes: Comparing Chinese Females with Other Females living in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jenkins, Sherida, L.</field><field name="description">Eating disorders affect individuals from most ethnic backgrounds. Research suggests that White females experience the greatest levels of disordered eating and body dissatisfaction. Studies examining Chinese females found they experienced similar levels of disordered eating but less body dissatisfaction to White females. This study was conducted to examine the prevalence of eating disorder symptomatology in Chinese and Other ethnicities in New Zealand. A sample of female university students at the University of Waikato completed questionnaires (N=116) to assess disordered eating and body dissatisfaction. In contrast to previous findings Chinese females actually exhibited more disordered eating behaviours and body dissatisfaction attitudes than did other females living in New Zealand. Also, fear of weight gain was more likely to be exhibited by Chinese females than other females. Pressure to be thin came from similar sources for both Chinese and other female students. While, length of time living in New Zealand did not appear to alter Chinese females' levels of disordered eating and body dissatisfaction. However in keeping with previous research, the present findings did suggest that the data from this study support the suggestion that the EAT-26 may not be an appropriate measure for Chinese females when assessing eating disorders. These findings have important implications for future research on ethnicities and eating disorders, and for clinicians working with Chinese female clients.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disordered eating</field><field name="subject">body dissatisfaction</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">females</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="subject">EAT-26</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Love on the line: The social dynamics involved with people meeting other people using New Zealand online dating sites</field><field name="creator">Marsh, Maureen Margaret</field><field name="description">The intention of this thesis is to explore whether New Zealand trends in online dating parallel those identified by overseas studies, or whether patterns are emerging that are unique to New Zealand society.  The Internet Windows Messenger instant messenger service (MSN) was used to interview 32 subjects about their experiences with online dating, covering areas such as motivation for using online dating; types of relationships sought; barriers to online dating; online rapport and offline chemistry; online infidelity; and managing 'difference'.  Drawing on these responses, this thesis presents findings pertaining to a diverse group of New Zealanders' attitudes towards and uses of online dating.  Some of the key findings show that online rapport does not guarantee offline chemistry; that there are gender differences in attitudes towards appearance, age, and receiving sexually explicit material online; and that sexual experimentation and infidelity are being facilitated through online dating.  The issue of 'difference' as it relates to online dating has been largely neglected by overseas researchers, and for this reason was extensively included in this research.  Key findings relating to 'difference' show that there is a clear split between those interviewees whose 'difference' impacted positively on their online dating experience (those with sexual 'difference' falling into this category), and those whose 'difference' impacted negatively (those with physical or mental 'difference'). In addition, those interviewees with a sexual 'difference' have been able to connect with other like-minded people through online dating, contributing to the 'normalization' of previously considered deviant behaviours. Based on the research presented in this thesis, it appears that New Zealand online dating activities are consistent with overseas trends, although there are indications that some behaviour may be more specific to New Zealand society, such as gender differences in relation to bisexuality, and covert same-sex encounters involving men who are either married or who state in their profiles that they are 'straight' or heterosexual.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">online dating; online infidelity; sexual experimentation; 'difference'</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding of marine environments and sustainability by primary school children in lombok, indonesia</field><field name="creator">Nusantari, Hani</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT  Seagrass beds, mangrove forests and coral reefs as a part of marine environments play an important role in the coastal regions. These environments support the coastal communities by providing resources such as food and income. For many years, marine environments have been facing destruction the majority of which is caused by human impact. The lack of knowledge of how to use and manage the marine resources wisely and sustainably is one reason why marine environments are still facing degradation.  Primary school children who live in two coastal villages in Lombok Island, Indonesia were questioned about their conceptual understanding of their local marine environments and their ideas about sustainability in these environments. Using an interpretive methodology framework, children and their teachers from Grades 5 and 6 in two primary schools in coastal villages, and elders in the villages were studied and. The data gathered from the children through questionnaires and interviews, and from teachers and elders through interviews. Quantitative and qualitative analysis was used to analyse this data. The children's experiences in their marine environment appear to have strong connection with their knowledge. Their knowledge also developed by interaction with the people in the communities. Children value their local marine environment as a place that provides food for them and their parents teach them to respect it. Long traditions such as dumping waste in the beach or sea has an impact on children from fishing families and creates a contradiction between the positive values they have and negative attitudes they act on. The children are not taught environmental education in the schools since it is not a compulsory subject and teachers lack knowledge about the marine environment. Teachers and elders feel the importance of teaching about the marine environment to their children to give them the knowledge and ability to use the marine resources in sustainable way. For children who are a part of coastal communities, learning about their local marine environment should be made a priority to so they have basic knowledge and understanding in using the marine environment in sustainable ways. Marine environmental education should not only educate children in formal school but also educate people in the communities. The coastal communities as a whole should be working together to achieve the aims of education and conservation. Additionally, the school as a whole needs to support the implementation of marine environmental education.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Primary school</field><field name="subject">marine environments</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="subject">understanding</field><field name="subject">values and attitudes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Statistical Learning in Multiple Instance Problems</field><field name="creator">Xu, Xin</field><field name="description">Multiple instance (MI) learning is a relatively new topic in machine learning.  It is concerned with supervised learning but differs from normal supervised learning in two points: (1) it has multiple instances in an example (and there is only one instance in an example in standard supervised learning), and (2) only one class label is observable for all the instances in an example (whereas each instance has its own class label in normal supervised learning).  In MI learning there is a common assumption regarding the relationship between the class label of an example and the ``unobservable'' class labels of the instances inside it.  This assumption, which is called the ``MI assumption'' in this thesis, states that ``An example is positive if at least one of its instances is positive and negative otherwise''.  In this thesis, we first categorize current MI methods into a new framework.  According to our analysis, there are two main categories of MI methods, instance-based and metadata-based approaches.  Then we propose a new assumption for MI learning, called the ``collective assumption''.  Although this assumption has been used in some previous MI methods, it has never been explicitly stated,\footnote{As a matter of fact, for some of these methods, it is actually claimed that they use the standard MI assumption stated above.} and this is the first time that it is formally specified.  Using this new assumption we develop new algorithms --- more specifically two instance-based and one metadata-based methods.  All of these methods build probabilistic models and thus implement statistical learning algorithms.  The exact generative models underlying these methods are explicitly stated and illustrated so that one may clearly understand the situations to which they can best be applied.  The empirical results presented in this thesis show that they are competitive on standard benchmark datasets.  Finally, we explore some practical applications of MI learning, both existing and new ones.  This thesis makes three contributions: a new framework for MI learning, new MI methods based on this framework and experimental results for new applications of MI learning.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">multi-instance learning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A local Aotearoa New Zealand investigation of the contribution of M&#257;ori cultural knowledges to Pakeha identity and counselling practices</field><field name="creator">Te Wiata, Joy</field><field name="description">This project investigates the experiences of a small group of social service  practitioners as they consider the question of what it means to be Pakeha in Aotearoa New Zealand in 2004.  Specifically this study considers the contribution  of M&#257;ori cultural knowledges to Pakeha identity.  It also explores whether therapeutic practices that participants have available, are relevant to their current  claims of Pakeha identity.   This study highlights the complexity of experience and multiple stories that inform constructions of identity.   In approaching the topic I was aware that many  important stories of people's lived experience are not often told.  People are often silenced due to the difficulty of 'telling'.  In this exploration, space was created  for the telling of stories, which are often not easily told:  stories of struggle and pain; stories of compassionate witnessing; stories of rule-breaking; stories of  stepping into territory beyond binaries and stories of richness and delight.   Knowledges have been produced that indicate the need for carefully crafted space for often very difficult identity conversations to occur and for voices to be heard.   Further, the study has produced knowledges for scaffolding for respectful and honouring conversations .  The stories of this project indicate that the  conversations required, have their foundation through engagement with the value of fairness.  Findings also indicate that forums, where mutual contribution to  identity for both M&#257;ori and Pakeha can be acknowledged, are a critical to establishing ongoing honourable relationships between Pakeha and M&#257;ori New Zealanders.     Throughout this project participants acknowledge and honour the rich  contribution of M&#257;ori knowledges and language to their Pakeha identity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pakeha identity</field><field name="subject">contribution of Maori knowledges</field><field name="subject">counselling practices</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preparation and Properties of Natural, Demineralized, Pure, and Doped Carbons from Biomass; Model of the Chemical Structure of Carbonized Charcoal.</field><field name="creator">Bourke, Jared</field><field name="description">Pioneering work performed by Rosalind Franklin over half a century ago provided the first structural models of two distinct carbon types: those that become graphitic during carbonization at high temperatures, and those that do not. Moreover it is known that certain properties of carbonaceous materials including combustion, surface area, electrical resistivity, and catalytic properties are influenced by mineral impurities.  The nature of this division in biocarbon structure and the known effects of minerals on carbon properties have led to this work; three principal topics were addressed; (1) the investigation of the solid state structure of biocarbons derived from various biomass feedstocks, (2) the removal of inorganic minerals from biomass, and (3) the investigation of biocarbon electronic structure subsequent to doping with select inorganic minerals.  Charcoals and carbonized charcoals (i.e. biocarbons) were prepared from a wide variety of biomass substrates, including pure sugars containing 5- and 6-membered rings with furanose and pyranose configurations, lignin, agricultural residues (corncob and nut shells) and a hard wood.  These biocarbons were subject to proximate and elemental analysis, gas sorption analysis, and analysis by ICP-MS, SEM, XRD, ESR, 13C CPMAS NMR, and MALDI-TOF MS.  All the carbonized charcoals contained oxygen heteroatoms, had high surface areas, and were excellent conductors of electricity.  Doping the biocarbon with boron or phosphorus resulted in a slight improvement in its electrical conductivity.  The XRD analysis indicated that the carbonized charcoals possess an aromaticity of about 71% that results from graphite crystallites with an average size of about 20  .  The NMR analysis confirmed the highly aromatic content of the carbonized charcoals.  The ESR signals indicated two major types of carbon-centered organic radicals.  A number of techniques employed highlighted differences between carbonized charcoals and synthetic graphite but none more so than MALDI-TOF spectrometry.  The biocarbons contained readily desorbed discrete ions with m/z values of 701, 685, 465, 453, 429, and 317.  All of the above findings were used to develop a model for the structure of carbonized charcoal that is consistent with the biocarbon's oxygen content, microporosity and surface area, electrical conductivity, radical content, and its MALDI-TOF spectra.  The removal of inorganic mineral constituents from various biomass feedstocks was achieved via simple washing/soaking techniques using two different aqueous media; deionized water and citric acid.  The most effective and consistent demineralization treatment for removing minerals from biomass involved a hot 0.1 molL-1 citric acid percolation treatment, ca.  67% of inorganic mineral matter was removed.  Mineral matter at the levels present in typical biomass derived charcoals and carbons had no significant influence upon the surface area or the electrical resistivity in carbonaceous materials after high heat treatment (950  C).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flash Carbonization</field><field name="subject">Charcoal</field><field name="subject">Carbon</field><field name="subject">Carbonized Charcoal</field><field name="subject">Biomass</field><field name="subject">Demineralization</field><field name="subject">Doping</field><field name="subject">MALDI-TOF-MS.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secondary Blooming and Mottling in an Intravaginal Drug Release Product</field><field name="creator">Waugh, Brendan Arthur</field><field name="description">Due to the thesis embargo no abstract is provided.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">progesterone</field><field name="subject">silicone</field><field name="subject">polydimethylsiloxane</field><field name="subject">CIDR</field><field name="subject">blooming</field><field name="subject">mottling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Ethnographic Exploration of Gender Experiences of a New Zealand Surf Culture</field><field name="creator">Corner, Sarah Britt</field><field name="description">This thesis is an ethnographic exploration of gender experiences in a New Zealand surf culture. I employed the methods of participant observation, semi-structured interviews and focus groups to accumulate in-depth and descriptive qualitative data from the men and women who surf in the community of Raglan. I was especially interested in the rules surrounding the act of lining up - a systematic etiquette used to queue for waves. I inquired about surfers' struggles when lining up to deepen my understanding of the cultural behaviour of surfing and to help reveal implicit rules underpinning surf etiquette. As a female surfer, I was especially interested to understand the gender-relations between men and women in the waters in which I participated in. I discovered that subtle rules pertain to different groups of surfers and group emerged based on 'other' surfer characteristics. Although gender surfaced as a characteristic way of sorting surfers into groups, gender did not stand out more critical than others revealed throughout the research process. What was evident throughout the research was that men and women experience more commonalities in their surfing experiences than differences. Therefore, this research shows how the waves become a contested spaces for surfers and how surf culture serves as a site for resistance to gendered identities in contemporary Western society.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ethnography</field><field name="subject">Surf Culture</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Raglan New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Experience</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The nature, composition and distribution of sediment in Lake Rotorua, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pearson, Lisa Kyle</field><field name="description">Lake Rotorua has become increasingly eutrophic over the past 2 to 3 decades. The sediments of the lake have been shown to exert an important influence on this eutrophication process. Chemistry of the sediments has been studied to determine the nature, composition and distribution of elements, through a 1.5 year coring programme. A geophysical survey together with sub-bottom profiling has provided stratigraphic information related to the bathymetry of the lake. Lake Rotorua has two types of sediments: coarse, dense (density c. 0.5 g/cm3) sediments comprised of clastic erosion products and coarse rhyolitic airfall components covering approximately 60% of the lake area; and fine, low-density (approximatly 0.02 g/cm3) diatomaceous ooze that covers the remaining 40% of the lake, accumulated from deposition of biota, predominantly diatom frustules of Aulacoseira granulata. The sediment contains a record of volcanic eruptions, with the Tarawera Tephra typically found 0.5 m below the sediment water interface and Kaharoa Tephra typically between 2 to 3 m depth, in water depths of 10-15 m. Phosphorus concentration in Lake Rotorua sediments decreases with sediment depth. In the centre of the lake phosphorus concentrations in the top 2 cm can exceed 2500 g/tonne and decline to 800 g/tonne at 20 cm depth. Accumulation rate of phosphorus in the sediment based on the nutrient budget is approximatly 29.6 t/yr. Iron and manganese concentrations in the sediment depend on the availability of the element and the sedimentation rate of diatom frustules, and are controlled by the redox conditions in the sediment. The average concentration of iron and manganese in the sediment is approximately 8000 g/tonne and between 300 and 400 g/tonne, respectively. Iron accumulates in the sediment at a rate of 385 t/yr and manganese at 17.9 t/yr. Maximum concentrations of arsenic in the sediment are 250 g/tonne but are generally between 50-100 g/tonne, depending on the water depth. Lead concentrations are typically below 15 g/tonne. Sediment concentrations of both arsenic and lead are highly correlated with iron and manganese concentrations in the sediment and mimic the respective concentration profiles. Arsenic and lead accumulate in the sediment at a rate of 3.71 and 0.49 t/yr, respectively. All elements show a peak in concentration in the tephra layers. The bathymetry of Lake Rotorua is dominated by a curved depression extending from Sulphur Point and almost reaching the Ohau Channel. This depression is probably a structural feature likely associated with the collapse of the caldera, but could be an ancient drainage channel. A series of conical depressions clustered to the north of Sulphur Point and to the east of Mokoia Island are likely to be hydrothermal explosion creators. In the north in the lake at water depths less than 10 m, a series of near-shore terraces are preserved in the sediment. Sub-bottom echo-sounding shows no return of sonic and seismic signals from most of the lake floor, indicating total absorption by the methane gas-filled sediment. In the shallow lake margin environments, generally less than 10 m water depth, gas is absent and a detailed stratigraphy of multiple reflectors from tephra layers was observed with sub-bottom profiles. The basin sediments of Lake Rotorua are significantly pockmarked, with deep, circular flat-bottomed depressions c. 20-60 m diameter and 0.5-6 m depth. The pockmarks are located on the lake floor in areas where the sediment is saturated with gas.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lake Rotorua</field><field name="subject">sediment</field><field name="subject">nutrient</field><field name="subject">pockmark</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breaking the Intergenerational Cycle of Physical Punishment</field><field name="creator">Sturkenboom, Gina Alicia</field><field name="description">Fifteen women and five men participated in a study aimed at devising strategies to reduce the use of physical punishment in New Zealand. The potential problems with the use of physical punishment, the extent of its use in New Zealand, and the likelihood of intergenerational transmission are discussed to justify the aim of the study. The participants were all parents who had been smacked themselves, but who had decided not to smack their own children. Their ages ranged from 28 to 57, and only three had less than some tertiary education. They were from various ethnic backgrounds; fourteen had an occupation other than parenting, and nine were single parents.  The participants had broken the intergenerational cycle of physical punishment: they had been smacked themselves but did not smack their own children. All participated in an individual, semi-structured interview, in which their childhood physical punishment, their decision not to smack, the maintenance of that decision, and their use of alternative disciplinary techniques were discussed. Four participated in a focus group, in which the strategies suggested in the interviews were discussed and refined to produce a final list of recommendations.  The parents made a conscious decision against smacking, which involved a particular experience that prompted them to consider their disciplinary practices. Negative views of smacking (ineffective, modelling violence, and potential to escalate) were also helpful in making the decision.  While maintaining their decision was usually easy, alternative techniques were sometimes hard to use, though effective in the long term. Some had to deal with the effects of deviating from a childrearing norm, particularly in regard to other family members. While many were satisfied that their own children were free from physical punishment, some had actively tried to convince other parents not to use it as well.  They recommended strategies aimed at achieving the goals of parent education, raising awareness, reducing strain, and increasing support for parents. They also suggested practical steps that individual parents who were interested in breaking the cycle of physical punishment could take. The limitations and strengths of the study are discussed, as well as the implications for further research. The study demonstrates that parenting without physical punishment is effective, desirable, and achievable, even by parents who were smacked themselves. It presents a number of possible strategies and intermediate goals, for interventions at a national, community, or individual level, which aim to reduce the use of physical punishment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">physical punishment</field><field name="subject">smacking</field><field name="subject">non-smacking</field><field name="subject">intergenerational transmission</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">strategies to reduce the use of smacking</field><field name="subject">spanking</field><field name="subject">corporal punishment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Maintenance of Group Identity Through Social Networks in the Bay of Plenty Dutch Community</field><field name="creator">Webster, Kaye Louise</field><field name="description">Abel Tasman, a Dutchman, was the first person to put New Zealand on European maps over three hundred years ago (in 1642) and today there are over twenty-eight thousand people living in New Zealand who identify themselves as Dutch and twenty-seven thousand people speaking the Dutch language.  Previous research has explored various aspects of Dutch migration, including migrant experiences, culture and language yet only de Bres (2004) compares the experiences of Dutch immigrants across time periods of their arrival. Cultural retention and maintenance has mainly been assessed via the use of the Dutch language rather than through other methods, such as Dutch customs and social networks. The main reason for this research is to compare the experiences and cultural identity of the three 'waves' of Dutch migrants, which has not been undertaken before.  This study interviewed six Dutch settler families living in the Bay of Plenty, from three time-periods (1950s; 1960s to 1980s; and 1990s to today) and across generations in order to compare their experiences and assess if and how they maintain their Dutch identity through their use of customs and social networks. Open-ended questionnaires and interview schedules were used to interview the sixteen participants. Content analysis was undertaken for the majority of the questionnaire and interview schedules. For the remaining questions that focused on social networks, the structural aspects of the social support for participants were measured in terms of the social network characteristics, size, density and multiplexity.  The study found an overall retention of Dutch identity across all time-periods for generation one (generation one refers to the migrating parents) with all families using the Dutch language within their own homes, yet only one family maintaining their Dutch identity through social networks and only one family maintaining their Dutch identity through the use of customs.  The second and third generation participants have little to no interest or involvement in the Dutch culture or community. One second generation participant considered herself Dutch-Kiwi, with the remaining second generation participants considering themselves New Zealanders. Only one person from the third generation participated and she identified herself as a Dutch-Kiwi. Overall, this study supports the perception of the 'invisible Dutch' however due to the small sample size it is impossible to make conclusive statements concerning the Bay of Plenty Dutch community.  There is a limited amount of research comparing the experiences of Dutch migrants and how their cultural identity is maintained through their social networks; therefore further research is required to fill this gap.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dutch</field><field name="subject">Bay of Plenty</field><field name="subject">social networks</field><field name="subject">group maintenance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Depositional record of historic lahars in the Whangaehu Gorge, Mt. Ruapehu</field><field name="creator">Graettinger, Alison Hollomon</field><field name="description">Mt. Ruapehu is one of the most lahar prone volcanoes in the world, having both a crater lake and six small glaciers upon its 2797 m summit.  The major outlet for the crater lake, the Whangaehu Gorge, has hosted over 46 historic lahars.  However, the low preservation of debris flow deposits, as a result of frequent remobilisation on steep slopes, allows for the detailed description of only 9 lahar events over the last 150 years.  Field investigation, historic aerial photos, two airborne LiDAR surveys and direct measurements have been utilised to describe the sedimentology, geomorphology and distribution of historic lahar deposits in the first 11 km of the Whangaehu Gorge.  Inundation maps have been created for 1945, 1953, 1975, September 1995, October 1995, March 2007 and September 2007.  Grain size distribution, componentry and geomorphology of the 1861, 1975, September 1995, October 1995, 1999 and 2007 lahar deposits have been compared.  The lahar deposits are massive, very poorly sorted, silty gravels that form a series of unconsolidated terraces.  The limited sediment sources in the steep sided Whangaehu Gorge, including minor historic eruption products, results in significant recycling of lahar deposits.  However, the deposits can be differentiated by proportions of lithological components and in some cases anthropogenic debris.  The abundance of hydrothermally altered material reflects the role of Crater Lake in lahar formation, although, some of these materials (gypsum, sulphur and snow) are only temporary. Non-cohesive debris flows and occasional snow slurry lahars have been formed by a range of triggering mechanisms associated with and independent of eruptions.  Lahars have been formed in the Whangaehu Valley as the result of ejected crater lake water and associated snow melt (1975, September 1995 and September 2007), as well as the progressive displacement of lake water as a result of lava dome growth (1945) and uplift of the lake floor (1968).  Inter-eruption lahars occur as a result of Crater Lake outburst floods (1861, 1953 and March 2007) and remobilisation by precipitation and the collapse of tephra laden snow (October 1995 and 1999).  The comparison of historic lahars also reflects the range of lahar magnitudes experienced historically on Ruapehu.  The most recent Crater Lake outburst of March 2007, with a peak discharge of 1700-2500 m3/s is the second largest recorded lahar, behind only the eruption-generated lahar of April 1975 with a peak discharge of 5000-7500 m3/s.  Lahar mitigation can subsequently be based on lahar generation and incorporation of the vast amounts of data collected before and after the 2007 outburst flood.  Recent remobilisation and phreatic activity suggest the significant under-representation of small volume events like rain-generated and snow slurry lahars in the geologic record.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lahars</field><field name="subject">ruapehu</field><field name="subject">debris flows</field><field name="subject">Whangaehu</field><field name="subject">Crater Lake</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk analysis associated with flank failure from Putauaki, Bay of Plenty, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hewitt, Dolan</field><field name="description">Volcanoes are dynamic evolving structures, with life cycles that are punctuated by episodes of flank instability. Putauaki (Mount Edgecumbe) is a stratovolcano located onshore in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand. The aim of this study was to assess the stability of Putauaki and analyse the risk associated with volcanic collapse. To achieve this objective, a multidisciplinary approach was used, incorporating geomorphological and geological mapping, rock mass classification, laboratory testing to identify geotechnical properties of materials representative of the volcano, stability modelling, and analysis of landslide run-out zones. Putauaki comprises two predominant features including the larger and younger Main Cone (the summit lying 820 m a.s.l., slope angles up to 36 ), and smaller and older Main Dome (the summit lying 420 m a.s.l., slope angle of 24 ). Both features show little evidence of erosion or surface water. Rock mass description defined six lithotechnical units including indurated andesite, indurated dacite, scoriaceous andesite, altered andesite (all categorised as hard rocks), and block and ash flow and Matahina Ignimbrite (both categorised as soft rocks). The uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of indurated andesite and indurated dacite was 60   4 MPa and 44.7   0.9 MPa respectively, correlating with moderately strong rock. Discontinuities of the indurated units were widely spaced, showed medium persistence and wide aperture, and were slightly weathered. Infill comprised predominantly loosely packed, very strong, coarse gravel. UCS of scoriaceous andesite and altered andesite was 25   5 MPa and 15   1 MPa respectively, allowing categorisation as very weak rock. Discontinuities of scoriaceous andesite were widely spaced, showed high persistence and wide aperture, and were moderately weathered. Discontinuities of the altered andesite were moderately spaced, showed low persistence and wide aperture, and were highly weathered. Infill of scoriaceous and altered andesite was loosely packed, moist, weak to very weak medium gravel. The block and ash flow was a poorly sorted, loosely packed, sandy, gravely and cobble rich matrix supported deposit. The Matahina Ignimbrite was a very weak, discontinuity-poor deposit. Shear box testing indicated cohesion and friction angle of 0 MPa and 42.1  (block and ash flow) and 1.4 x 10-3 MPa and 41.7  (Matahina Ignimbrite) respectively. These values are similar to published values. Correlation of each lithotechnical unit to its respective rock mass description site allowed approximate boundaries of each unit to be mapped. Each unit's mass strength was combined with measured bulk densities and incorporated into two dimensional slope profiles using the stability modelling package GalenaTM. Ten slope profiles of Putauaki were constructed. Failure surfaces for each slope profile were defined using the Bishop simplified multiple analysis method. Four slope profiles showed the potential for small scale failure (less than 0.1 km2 of material). The remaining six slope profiles showed the potential for large scale failure (greater than 0.1 km2 of material). Stability of these six slope profiles was investigated further in relation to earthquake force, watertable elevation, and a disturbance factor of the rock mass (D). Conditions of failure graphs for profile 6a showed that at low D (less than 0.4), earthquake forces and watertable elevation must be unrealistically high for the region (greater than 0.33 g; greater than 15% watertable elevation) in order produce a factor of safety less than 1. The remaining five slope profiles showed potential to be unstable under realistic earthquake forces and watertable elevations. Two of these profiles were unable to achieve stability at D greater than 0.8 (profile 4) and D greater than 0.9 (profile 5). A D value of 0.6 (intermediate between 0.4 and 0.8) is argued to most realistically represent Putauaki. The fact that Putauaki has not undergone large scale failure to date supports the conclusion that the constructed models overestimate the influence of those factors which promote slope instability. Maximum and minimum landslide run-out zones were constructed for the slope profiles exhibiting the potential for large scale failure. Definition of the position and extent of maximum and minimum run-out zones assumed H/L (fall height to run-out length) ratios of 0.09 and 0.18 respectively, as well as the 'credible flow path' concept. Identified impacts of landslides sourced from Putauaki include inundation of Kawerau Township, Tarawera River, forestry operations, road networks, and power supplies. Based on these impacts, the risk posed by landslides from each slope profile was categorised as ranging from relatively low to relatively high. Landslides sourced from the south-west flanks pose a relatively low risk due to their prerequisite of unrealistically high watertable elevations and earthquake forces. Landslides sourced from the north-west flanks pose a relatively high risk as minimum run-out will inundate north-east parts of Kawerau Township. Landslides sourced from the eastern flanks pose a moderate risk due to their run-out zones avoiding Kawerau Township.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">volcanic landslides</field><field name="subject">risk analysis</field><field name="subject">limit equlibrium</field><field name="subject">Putauaki</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Association of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Surfactant Protein A and D with Otitis Media.</field><field name="creator">Barnett, Catherine Margaret Eleanor</field><field name="description">Otitis Media is one of the most common childhood diseases. Recurrent acute otitis media RAOM is characterized by repeated episodes of inflammation of the middle ear in conjunction with middle ear fluid, and often with an inflamed or bulging eardrum. Defective clearance by the Eustachian tube results in mucus build-up and is characteristic of otitis media with effusion (OME). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus are the most common contributors to otitis media pathogenesis. In New Zealand, OME has been implicated with conductive hearing loss in childhood and has been shown to significantly impact on speech and language development. New Zealand M&#257;ori and Polynesian children have displayed significantly higher hearing test failure rates than European-Caucasian children.  The collectins, Surfactant Protein (SP)-A and -D are encoded by three genes (SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D) and are host defense proteins present in the middle ear and Eustachian tube. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SP-A1 and SP-A2 have been associated with increased or decreased susceptibility to otitis media, meningococcal disease, and range of respiratory diseases. Using allele-specific primers and real-time PCR with SYBR  Green I melting curve analysis, four groups of individuals were genotyped for eleven SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D SNPs: European-Caucasian individuals with RAOM/OME; New Zealand M&#257;ori/Polynesian individuals with RAOM/OME; individuals with meningococcal disease; and a control group. The computer program, Haploview, was employed to perform &#967;2 analyses and identify statistically significant associations of alleles/haplotypes with RAOM/OME or meningococcal disease.  In the European-Caucasian population, two SP-A1 alleles, one SP-A2 allele, and four haplotypes (CGAGC, 1A3, 1A9, and 1A10) were found to be associated with increased risk of RAOM/OME (P lt; 0.05). Conversely, haplotypes 6A2 and 1A2 were found to be protective against susceptibility to RAOM/OME (P lt; 0.05). In New Zealand M&#257;ori and Polynesian individuals, two SP-A1 alleles, three SP-A2 alleles, one SP-D allele, and four haplotypes (6A8, 6A10, 1A3, and 1A10) were found to be associated with increased risk of RAOM/OME (P lt; 0.05). An additional four haplotypes (6A2, 1A0, 1A2, and TA) were determined to be protective against susceptibility to RAOM/OME (P lt; 0.05). However, protective SPA1/SPA2/SPD haplotype 6A2-1A0-TA was significantly under-represented in the New Zealand M&#257;ori and Polynesian population (P lt; 0.05). A single allele and haplotype were associated with increased risk of meningococcal disease (P lt; 0.05).  The findings of this study confirm that specific genetic variants of SP-A and SP-D are associated with either increased or decreased risk of developing RAOM and/or OME. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that New Zealand M&#257;ori and Polynesian individuals appear to exhibit more haplotypes susceptible to RAOM/OME. This may provide a partial explanation for the higher RAOM/OME-related failure rates of hearing tests in New Zealand M&#257;ori and Polynesian children. However, there are numerous socio-economic and environmental factors that also contribute to otitis media pathogenesis which were not considered in this study. The effects of the SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D alleles and haplotypes on the bacterial/viral binding efficiencies of SP-A and SP-D need to be investigated by further research, using a large population, to confirm the association with susceptibility or resistance with RAOM/OME.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">otitis media</field><field name="subject">surfactant</field><field name="subject">SNP</field><field name="subject">OME</field><field name="subject">RAOM</field><field name="subject">haplotype</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of video based road commentary training on the hazard perception skills of teenage novice drivers</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Amy Rose</field><field name="description">Recent evidence in the road safety research literature indicates that skills in hazard perception, visual search and attention may be developing executive functions in young novice drivers before the age of 25 years, contributing to their unintentional risk taking behaviour and subsequent high crash rates. The present research aimed to investigate these skills, whether they are predictive of each other, and whether hazard perception can be improved through road commentary training. Twenty-two young novice drivers and eight experienced drivers were recruited as participants in this study. The experienced drivers performed significantly better than the novice drivers on the hazard detection task that was specifically designed for the study. Their visual search skills were also examined and compared using the Visual Search and Attention Test, with the experienced drivers performing significantly better than the novice drivers. Interestingly, a significant positive correlation was found between the scores of the participants on the hazard detection task and the Visual Search and Attention Test which may indicate that the hazard detection skills can be predicted. The novice driver group who received 12 trials of video based road commentary training significantly improved in their hazard detection skills, suggesting that video based road commentary could be an effective road safety intervention for young novice drivers and if developed into a more comprehensive programme, holds promise for future implementation into the New Zealand Graduated Driver Licensing System. The results also hold promise for future investigation into the use of the Visual Search and Attention Test as a predictor of hazard perception skills in novice drivers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Young novice drivers</field><field name="subject">hazard perception</field><field name="subject">visual search and attention</field><field name="subject">risk taking</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hamilton-Jacobi Theory and Superintegrable Systems</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, Craig Keith</field><field name="description">Hamilton-Jacobi theory provides a powerful method for extracting the equations of motion out of some given systems in classical mechanics. On occasion it allows some systems to be solved by the method of separation of variables. If a system with n degrees of freedom has 2n - 1 constants of the motion that are polynomial in the momenta, then that system is called superintegrable. Such a system can usually be solved in multiple coordinate systems if the constants of the motion are quadratic in the momenta. All superintegrable two dimensional Hamiltonians of the form H = (p_x)sup2 + (p_y)sup2 + V(x,y), with constants that are quadratic in the momenta were classified by Kalnins et al [5], and the coordinate systems in which they separate were found.  We discuss Hamilton-Jacobi theory and its development from a classical viewpoint, as well as superintegrability. We then proceed to use the theory to find equations of motion for some of the superintegrable Hamiltonians from Kalnins et al [5].

In addition, this research focused on the impact that social, economic, cultural and environmental factors have on oral health. A total of 32 participants were invited to take part in this research: 15 5-year-old children from three selected schools, 15 (of the children's) caregivers and 2 dental therapists who work in the Hamilton City region. The findings indicated that overall M&#257;ori children and children of lower socio-economic status had a much higher prevalence of dental caries (tooth decay) than non-M&#257;ori children and children of higher socio-economic status. A number of contributing factors were shown to be responsible for this disparity including the cultural inappropriateness of oral health services and resources, affordability, role-modelling, parental awareness and education, and the transient nature of families.

Behavioural difficulties are those behaviours that students sometimes exhibit that are inappropriate and unacceptable in the classrooms or schools, as they disrupt the smooth process of teaching and learning.         This study investigated primary school teachers' perspectives of the causal factors of students' behavioural problems and what can be done to minimise this problem. The study was carried out in the Madang Province involving two primary schools. From the two schools, twelve teachers (six from each school) participated in the study. The same participants were involved in both the questionnaire and the semi structured interview. The data gathered for the questionnaire and interview were analysed and transcribed respectively.         The findings discovered that the family and school factors contributed substantially towards students' inappropriate behaviours. Family factors include parental problems, abuse in the families, and the constant struggle to provide the basic necessities due to the high living cost. School factors, on the other hand, include negative teacher attitudes, teacher lack of knowledge and skills to adapt the curriculum to include social skills, lack of teacher support and encouragement, and peer influences. The findings also discovered that teachers were more bothered about externalising behaviours such as disruption and aggression than internalising behavioural problems like withdrawal and depression displayed by students. Further, teachers' limited pre-service and in-service training and lack of experience in teaching students with behavioural problems contributed significantly for teachers not attending to students who behave inappropriately.         Based on the findings identified in the study, several recommendations were made on how to intervene to alleviate this problem. Of particular importance is teacher training at both the pre-service and in-service level. Also government support is needed in terms of funding for training, involving specialists and other resources to respond to student behavioural problems effectively and efficiently. The findings may have particular relevance to future studies in this area and provide teachers with effective and workable intervention strategies for students' behavioural problems in the classrooms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Behaviour difficulties</field><field name="subject">causal factors</field><field name="subject">intervention strategies</field><field name="subject">classroom management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical Characterisation of Compression Wood in Plantation Grown Pinus Radiata</field><field name="creator">Nanayakkara, Bernadette</field><field name="description">The primary objective of this study was to find out if changes in chemistry could be used to quantify Pinus radiata compression wood severity or degree of compression wood development. Basic chemical composition and the lignin structure was assessed for a range of different compression wood samples sourced from juvenile wood, mature wood, earlywood, latewood, branches, knots, 2-year and 1-year old Pinus radiata. Fluorescence microscopy was used as the reference method to assess the degree of compression wood development. Lignin structure of compression wood was studied by thioacidolysis, size exclusion chromatography, and thioacidolysis/31P NMR spectroscopy. Variation in the basic chemical composition and lignin structure with compression wood severity was ascertained. Results showed that, as the severity of compression wood changed, progressively from normal through mild to severe, all chemical parameters commonly associated with compression wood changed concurrently. With increasing severity lignin and galactose levels increased while glucose and mannose levels decreased. Lignin structural changes were also associated with changing severity of compression wood. Levels of p-hydroxyphenyl (H) releasable &#946;-ethers increased and guaiacyl (G) releasable &#946;-ethers decreased. Similarly, levels of uncondensed p-hydroxyphenyl units increased, while uncondensed guaiacyl units decreased. Similar proportions of condensed guaiacyl units were present in compression wood and normal wood. Similar trends in chemical composition were observed between the compression wood and related opposite wood in branches, knots and young wood of Pinus radiata. A number of chemical parameters changed linearly with compression wood severity. They were: the amount of lignin and galactose, the galactose/glucose ratio and p-hydroxyphenyl content in lignin. Parameters based on the p-hydroxyphenyl unit content in lignin, the H/G releasable &#946;-ether ratio, releasable p-hydroxyphenyl &#946;-ether units and uncondensed p-hydroxyphenyl C9 units are most suitable indicators of compression wood severity as they spanned a larger range relative to the normal wood levels and were not influenced by the morphological origin of wood samples. Chemical methods for quantifying compression wood severity should focus on the detection and measurement of these parameters. Galactan present in Pinus radiata compression wood was isolated and characterised. Structural investigation by methylation analysis and NMR spectroscopy revealed that this galactan was largely composed of (1&#8594;4)-linked &#946;-D-galactopyranose residues. No evidence was found to indicate the presence of any branches. Characterisation of lignin in cell wall fractions of Pinus radiata normal wood revealed that middle lamella lignin has a higher lignin content, a lower amount of releasable &#946;-ethers and a more condensed lignin than the secondary wall lignin. Levels of releasable p-hydroxyphenyl units were not higher in middle lamella lignin. A new method based on thioacidolysis and 31P quantitative NMR spectroscopy for estimation of the degree of lignin condensation of the phenolic and etherified C9 units in in situ wood lignin is described. Using this method it was found that phenolic C9 units in in situ lignin were considerably less condensed than etherified C9 units in both compression wood and normal wood.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="subject">compression wood</field><field name="subject">galactan</field><field name="subject">lignin</field><field name="subject">p-hydroxyphenyl units</field><field name="subject">severity</field><field name="subject">thioacidolysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sedimentation And Hydrodynamics of Whitianga Estuary</field><field name="creator">Reeve, Glen M.D</field><field name="description">Whitianga Estuary is a bayhead barrier type estuary located on the east of the Coromandel Peninsula, North Island, New Zealand. The catchment has undergone many land-use changes since pre-European settlement. In some areas of the catchment land-use has changed from native forest to grasslands to forestry and back to pasture. These changes in catchment land-use all contribute to increased sedimentation into the estuary. Development of the estuary itself has also occurred in recent times. Much growth has been focussed around the estuary due to Whitianga town-ship having a large boating community, and includes a 170 berth marina and wharf situated at the tidal inlet entrance to the estuary. These, and the extensive canal development engineering works can have substantial impacts on the sedimentation regime, and may modify tidal circulation, flushing, and sediment deposition within the estuary.  The principle aim of this research is to assess hydrodynamics and sedimentation of the estuary for future management and development purposes, and also to model different scenarios in order to determine the most cost effective, and least obtrusive design for a proposed boat-ramp and approach channel near the marina.  To determine sedimentation rates, sediment cores from four locations were collected to depths of 1 m. Coring locations were chosen based on preliminary model run results, selecting areas that appeared to be long-term sediment sinks of a stable nature. Cores were divided into 10 mm sections and prepared for 210Pb dating and heavy metal analysis, to make an assessment of the vertical sedimentation rates. Recent sedimentation rates were found to be as high as 9 mm/yr post-1950s and past sedimentation rates as high as 30 mm/yr pre-1950s. The use of heavy metal analysis for dating proved difficult as the background levels of the conservative elements used to normalise results varied, making the geochemical analysis approach inappropriate.  As bathymetry is one of the most important aspects of modelling, a large amount of surveying was undertaken for this study. LiDAR, singlebeam data, and recent rectified aerial photographs were interpreted for the creation of a bathymetric grid file to be used for hydrodynamic modelling of the estuary.  The 3DD numerical model was used to determine tidal flows and current velocities. From this initial hydrodynamic model a particle-tracking model was created to determine sediment transport pathways within the estuary. From the initial 20 m model it was then possible to create a number of nested model grids for the purpose of determining the best practice scenario for the creation of a proposed boat ramp and associated approach channel near the harbour entrance. Hydrodynamic results suggest that residual circulation in Whitianga Estuary is nearly in balance, with a low ebb tidal domination present. Particle tracking results suggest that sediment entrained and carried into and within the estuary will accumulate on the intertidal flats. Sediment transport modelling indicates that the impact of a proposed boat-ramp will result in sedimentation of the dredged approach channel due to reductions in residual and tidal velocities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Sedimentation</field><field name="subject">Whitianga Estuary</field><field name="subject">Modelling</field><field name="subject">3DD</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the success of a translocation of black mudfish (Neochanna diversus)</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Amy Elizabeth</field><field name="description">All of New Zealand's five endemic species of mudfish (Neochanna) are threatened, and translocation has been recommended as an option for conservation.  This research undertakes a translocation of black mudfish (Neochanna diversus) into wetland margins of Lake Kaituna, in the Waikato region, and addresses research questions applicable to improving translocation success.  Results from this research are intended to aid possible future translocations of the more threatened Northland mudfish (Neochanna heleios) and other genetically distinct populations of black mudfish.  Captive rearing of juveniles collected from the wild is currently the most feasible option for sourcing translocation stock.  Mudfish juveniles (greater than 25 mm T.L.) had greater survival rates, compared to mudfish fry less than 25 mm T.L.  Mudfish growth was far greater when fed on a combined diet of brine shrimp (Artemia salina) and white worms (Enchytraeus albidus) than when fed exclusively on brine shrimp.  Temperature was found to have a small effect on mudfish growth, with a slightly greater growth in fish at 15 C than those at 10 C.  The introduced species Gambusia affinis has been the subject of concern for mudfish conservation and commonly found at wetland sites suitable for mudfish translocation.  Found to prey on mudfish fry and eggs in aquaria, it was important to determine the effects of Gambusia density prior to undertaking a translocation to a location where Gambusia were present.  Investigations were made into the effect of Gambusia density on black mudfish juveniles in 9 outdoor mesocosms.  Increasing Gambusia density was found to have an inhibitory effect on black mudfish growth.  This may be due to increased competition for food, a theory supported by analysis of zooplankton communities, where, in the presence of Gambusia, large zooplankton had been removed and smaller rotifers flourished.  Monitoring programmes are required to assess any impacts or improvements of mudfish populations, including those created by translocation.  A Gee minnow trapping programme in outdoor mesocosms was conducted to test the reliability of traps, finding that water depth, mudfish density, mudfish memory and trap shyness had no effect on the trapability of mudfish.  Trap position was found to have the most significant effect, with a greater number of mudfish caught when traps were set overnight at the surface than when set on the bottom of mesocosms.  Black mudfish adults and juveniles were translocated into 18 pools (~1 m diameter) on the wetland margins of Lake Kaituna in September 2006, followed by monthly monitoring.  Water quality monitoring and an assessment of hydrology and vegetation was undertaken.  Habitat characterisation was found to be a key factor, with correlations between water quality data and trapping results finding fewer fish remaining in pools with less suitable characteristics for mudfish (e.g. high turbidity and conductivity).  Other species were found to have a large impact, with predation by shortfinned eels (Anguilla australis) thought to have eliminated mudfish from some pools.  In addition fewer mudfish were caught in pools with Gambusia, possibly due to increased competition.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">black mudfish</field><field name="subject">Neochanna diversus</field><field name="subject">translocation</field><field name="subject">Gambusia density</field><field name="subject">rearing</field><field name="subject">Gee minnow traps</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Eclipse Environment for Z</field><field name="creator">Xu, Chengdong</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on the design, implementation and evaluation of a new interactive Z environment that is integrated into the Eclipse environment. The Z language is a formal specification notation that is used to describe and model computer-based systems.  For the widespread use of Z, it is desirable to integrate Z support with a mature and popular editing environment, such as Eclipse.  Eclipse was chosen as the basis for the new Z environment because it is widely used, it provides rich functionality and it is designed to be extensible. The Z environment described in this thesis extends Eclipse to provide a large set of useful features for editing and analyzing Z specifications, such as a table of Z symbols, constant detection of syntax and type errors, outlining facilities, cross-referencing of Z names and conversion between different Z markups.  User feedback shows that the resulting Z environment is helpful for editing and correcting Z specifications. The development of the Z support for Eclipse is a part of the CZT (Community Z Tools) project, which is a Java framework for building Z tools and provides parsers, typecheckers and other Z tools.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eclipse</field><field name="subject">Z</field><field name="subject">CZT</field><field name="subject">Community Z Tools</field><field name="subject">Z Support</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pacific Islanders and Health in the Print News Media</field><field name="creator">Loto, Robert</field><field name="description">Pacific Islanders have faced discrimination in New Zealand particularly since the 1960s when members of communities, particularly from the Cook Islands, Samoa, Niue and Tonga began to be transplanted from their home nations to Aotearoa as cheap immigrant labour. Subsequently, the New Zealand vernacular has contained references to Pacific Islanders as 'overstayers', 'coconuts', 'bungas' and 'fresh off the boat' [FOB]. However, the legacy of a domineering relationship between the Palagi1 majority group and Pacific2 minorities that is captured by such derogatory terms is still evident in public forums such as the media. Using a quantitative content and qualitative narrative analysis, this first chapter documents portrayals of Pacific Islanders in New Zealand print media reports (n= 65) published over a three-month period. Findings reveal that Pacific people are predominantly portrayed as unmotivated, unhealthy and criminal others who are overly dependent on Palagi support. Consideration of this offered Pacific identity formation is explored and compared with that implied for Palagi, which is active, independent, competent and caring. Issues in coverage are discussed in relation to how Pacific Islanders are encouraged to see themselves, and the health and social consequences of dominant practices in press coverage.  The second part of this thesis will take the findings from the investigation of the characterizations of Pacific Islanders in newspaper coverage and consider audience responses to such coverage. Focus group discussions will be used to explore how different New Zealand audiences view and respond to the portrayals of Pacific Island people and health in news media. The focus on audience responses supports the development of a better understanding of how groups can internalise media portrayals and use these as anchor points for understanding their own situations. Qualitative content from the two groups of Pacific Islanders (P1, P2) and two groups of Palagi (NP1, NP2) enabled a comparative analysis of audience interpretations. Findings propose that health issues are predominantly framed from the perspective of the dominant social group - in the local context Palagi - often at the expense of minority groups such as M&#257;ori and Pacific peoples. In appropriating aspects of news coverage, audience members do not engage or regurgitate what they are told or shown through the media. It is a rather complex process with audience members interpreting and using fragments of what they are presented with in making sense of issues of concern in their own lives. All the participants (n= 24) were compensated for their time and travel. We offer some suggestions as to how more equitable representations of Pacific people could be fostered in news media and how changes to a more civilised media will impact Pacific health positively.   1 Palagi (pronounced Palangi) is a term used by Pacific Islanders to refer to people of European decent. 2 We use the terms 'Pacific people' and 'Pacific Islanders' to denote a general social category or minority in Aotearoa used by the media. However, we need to qualify the use of these terms because their use can lead to a glossing over of the diversity in languages and cultures that exists between over 20 different Polynesian, Melanesian and Micronesian communities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pacific</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">representation</field><field name="subject">audience</field><field name="subject">racism</field><field name="subject">discrimination</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a GIS-Based Decision Support Tool For Evaluating Potential Wind Farm Sites</field><field name="creator">Xu, Xiao Mark</field><field name="description">In recent years, the popularity of wind energy has grown. It is starting to play a large role in generating renewable, clean energy around the world. In New Zealand, there is increasing recognition and awareness of global warming and the pollution caused by burning fossil fuels, as well as the increased difficulty of obtaining oil from foreign sources, and the fluctuating price of non-renewable energy products. This makes wind energy a very attractive alternative to keep New Zealand clean and green. There are many issues involved in wind farm development. These issues can be grouped into two categories - economic issues and environmental issues. Wind farm developers often use site selection process to minimise the impact of these issues. This thesis aims to develop GIS based models that provide effective decision support tool for evaluating, at a regional scale, potential wind farm locations. This thesis firstly identifies common issues involved in wind farm development. Then, by reviewing previous research on wind farm site selection, methods and models used by academic and corporate sector to solve issues are listed. Criteria for an effective decision support tool are also discussed. In this case, an effective decision support tool needs to be flexible, easy to implement and easy to use. More specifically, an effective decision support tool needs to provide users the ability to identify areas that are suitable for wind farm development based on different criteria.  Having established the structure and criteria for a wind farm analysis model, a GIS based tool was implemented using AML code using a Boolean logic model approach. This method uses binary maps for the final analysis. There are a total of 3645 output maps produced based on different combination of criteria. These maps can be used to conduct sensitivity analysis. This research concludes that an effective GIS analysis tool can be developed for provide effective decision support for evaluating wind farm sites.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wind farm site selection</field><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="subject">Boolean logic model</field><field name="subject">Binary classification</field><field name="subject">Multi-criteria decision support</field><field name="subject">sensitivity analysis.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The BSD Socket API for Simulator</field><field name="creator">Liu, Zhiwei</field><field name="description">BSD Socket API for Simulator is a project to run untouched Real World Application (RWA) binaries on the powerful modern general-purpose network simulators. BSD Socket API for Simulator is designed to eliminate most of the drawbacks of previous works. It is simulator independence, so it can make use of the powerful functionality and versatile tools provided by modern general-purpose simulators such as NS-2. It is fully compatible with BSD Socket API, so RWA can be run on it without re-linking and re-compiling. It is transparent to the RWA, so RWAs are run on BSD Socket API for Simulator as they are on normal operating systems. BSD Socket API for Simulator is built on the concept of message redirecting. It has two critical parts: shared library and customized simulator application. The shared library is loaded into the address space of RWA. On one hand, messages sent by RWA are captured by the shared library and redirected to the customized simulator application. On the other hand, messages from simulator are redirected by the customized simulator application to the shared library. BSD Socket API for Simulator has been intensively tested. The test results show that it functions as expected and it has an acceptable performance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BSD Socket API</field><field name="subject">network simulator</field><field name="subject">real world application</field><field name="subject">ns-2</field><field name="subject">message redirecting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rocks Can Turn to Sand and be Washed Away but Words Last Forever: A Policy Recommendation for New Zealand's Vilification Legislation</field><field name="creator">Jones, Christopher David</field><field name="description">Free speech and free expression are values that are highly prized in western society. The mention of removing or altering that right creates great debate. In 2004 a Select Committee was set up to inquire into what New Zealand's stance on Hate Speech should be. The submissions to that committee made it clear that free expression was a highly held right in New Zealand. While the submitters were overwhelming opposed to any legislation, it was clear that many had no understanding of what hate speech was, and why people would want to restrict it. The select Committee needed to provide the public with more information about what was intended and what the international situation is. If nothing else this thesis should provide that comprehensive background information to ground any further debate.  This thesis makes a policy recommendation for the New Zealand Government. The policy that is examined and contrasted with international experiences is that of hate speech legislation. What should New Zealand do in regards to hate speech? The general debate is examined and the free expression versus legislation debate is analysed to provide a comprehensive background to the topic. The reasons why free expression is important to society and democracy are examined. Alongside free expression, the harms of hate speech are also analysed in order to demonstrate what harm occurs and if such harms should be legislated against.  The international situation is contrasted with the New Zealand experience. The legislation of the United States, Canada and Australia, is analysed in order to compare and contrast with New Zealand's legislation. These three countries are closely aligned with New Zealand in terms of language, politics and culture. These countries provide equivalent characteristics and are therefore the most useful for comparison. The United States is especially important as it has no hate speech legislation and provides a valuable baseline from which the effects of legislation can be compared against.  The New Zealand situation is then examined to point out its strengths and weaknesses. Where there are weaknesses this thesis recommends changes that could be made in varying political circumstances. Hate speech and free speech issues are not largely discussed in New Zealand literature and scholarly work. This thesis follows some work that has been previously done on the topic in New Zealand. The bulk of the work written about hate speech and free speech issues has been completed internationally and needs to be adjusted to fit the New Zealand situation. This recommendation has gone some way to doing that. An area of particular interest in this paper is the categories of people that deserve protection. Historically just 'race' has been provided protection from hate speech in New Zealand and this thesis examines why. Central to this investigation is why other categories are not protected.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hate Speech</field><field name="subject">Vilification</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">New Zealand legislation</field><field name="subject">Free Speech</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Government Involvement in New Zealand Sport - Sport Policy: a Cautionary Tale</field><field name="creator">Lawrence, Hugh David Vincent</field><field name="description">Government involvement in New Zealand sport spans over 70 years from provisions of the Physical Welfare Act in 1937 to current provisions of the Sport and Recreation Act 2002. Thousands of volunteers in non-profit organisations continue to underpin New Zealand's sport system. It is axiomatic that sport defines part of what it means to be a New Zealander. Governments frequently use the rhetoric of community cohesion, national pride, life skills and public health benefits to justify its involvement. This thesis examines the impact of government intervention on the sport sector, its funding paradigms and the extent of sector engagement in a policy for sport. Through an examination of available government and sport sector records, and the author's own experience as a participant in events, the thesis recounts a sequence of five milestones for the New Zealand sport system and views them through a public management system lens. The passing of the Physical Welfare and Recreation Act in 1937, the establishment of a Ministry and Council for Recreation and Sport in 1973, the ministerial Sports Development Inquiry in 1984, the Prime Minister's Review of High Performance Sport in 1995 and the Sport, Fitness and Leisure Ministerial Taskforce. Government funding of sport now stands at around $100 million annually from small beginnings of $3,295 in 1945/1946, despite the absence of a comprehensive national policy for sport. By examining the chronology through a wider state sector lens, the thesis opens a window to the practical effect of public policy processes on matters of importance to the New Zealand sport sector and its voluntary sector foundations. This thesis also provides a rationale for revitalising the engagement between government and the New Zealand sport sector to meet the expectations of a modern state sector to meaningfully engage citizens and the non-government sector in the formation of policy and planning its implementation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sport policy</field><field name="subject">government policy</field><field name="subject">non-government organisation</field><field name="subject">government engagement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Connecting the Points: An Investigation into Student Learning about Decimal Numbers</field><field name="creator">Moody, Bruce David</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research project was to investigate the effects of a short-term teaching experiment on the learning of decimal numbers by primary students. The literature describes this area of mathematics as highly problematic for students. The content first covered student understanding of decimal symbols, and how this impacted upon their ability to order decimal numbers and carry out additive operations. It was then extended to cover the density of number property, and the application of multiplicative operations to situations involving decimals. In doing so, three areas of cognitive conflict were encountered by students, the belief that longer decimal numbers are larger than shorter ones (irrespective of the actual digits), that multiplication always makes numbers bigger, and that division always makes numbers smaller. The use of a microgenetic approach yielded data was able to be presented that provides details of the environment surrounding the moments where new learning was constructed. The characteristics of this environment include the use of physical artifacts and situational contexts involving measurement that precipitate student discussion and reflection. The methodology allowed for the collection of evidence regarding the highly complex nature of the learning, with evidence of 'folding back' to earlier schema and the co-existence of competing schema.   The discussion presents reasons as to why the pedagogical approach that was employed facilitated learning. One of the main findings was that the use of challenging problems situated in measurement contexts that involved direct student participation promoted the extension and/or re-organization of student schema with regard to decimal numbers. The study has important implications for teachers at the upper primary level wanting to support student learning about the decimal numbers system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decimals</field><field name="subject">cognitive conflict</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">student learning</field><field name="subject">ZPD</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Childfree couples' experiences of stereotyping, harassment and pressure</field><field name="creator">Riley, Theresa Mary</field><field name="description">This qualitative study is about New Zealand couples who, by choice, do not have children. Strong social norms exist for couples to have children, and those who express a desire to do otherwise have been disbelieved, pressured, and stereotyped. Womanhood has continued to be associated with motherhood, and a maternal instinct is expected to drive women to have children. The aim of this research was to add to knowledge and awareness of how childfree people have experienced being stereotyped, pressured and harassed for being childfree. For this research, I conjointly interviewed ten heterosexual, childfree couples residing in the city of Hamilton. Participants self-identified as childfree, and ranged in age from 23 to 56 years old. Five of the couples also participated in a focus group. Participants related the ways in which they perceived that the wider social context played a role in the negative responses they experienced. Participants revealed how they felt less socially valued through: an idealization of parenthood, exclusion from work benefits, and an expectation that women should manage both employment and motherhood. Stereotyping was found to still occur, with participants reporting that they were labelled as selfish, immature, and anti-children. Stereotypes of being destined for loneliness in later life, and of their pets being substitutes for children were common. Some evidence was found in participants' comments that there were elements of truth in stereotypes of the childfree. The negative stereotyping appeared to have little, if any, impact on how participants viewed or felt about themselves. Participants reported feeling harassed by other people's disbelief in their choice, and assumptions, that despite what they said, everybody wanted children. The pressures experienced by participants took various forms, such as persistent questioning, and came from various sources, including siblings and acquaintances. Participants' reports of feeling pressured or harassed seem to reflect minor and fleeting feelings, rather than a continuing concern. How pressuring comments were perceived by the recipient was very context-dependent. Participants tolerated and coped with people's negative responses by various methods, such as confronting, ignoring, and avoiding the topic of children with certain people. I recommend that further research be done, and that work is needed to promote both acceptance of the childfree option, and freedom of women's identification from association with childbearing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">childfree</field><field name="subject">stereotyping</field><field name="subject">couples</field><field name="subject">childless</field><field name="subject">pressure</field><field name="subject">harassment</field><field name="subject">social norms</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of short-term remembering in the possum: Using a Delayed-Matching-To-Sample Procedure.</field><field name="creator">Hardaker, Bethany Jane</field><field name="description">In Experiment one 7 Brushtail possums were trained, using food, to perform a Delayed-Matching-To-Sample procedure using still and flickering light stimuli, over a 0, 1 and 2 second delay.  A criterion of 80 percent correct for 5 consecutive days was set for the requirement to probe test.  Probe session delays were 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 seconds.  Performance was analysed using the measure of discrimination log d.  Log d = 1 at the possums training delay and dropped back to log d = 0 at the longer inexperienced delays.  The possums performance at this task was only adequate, so in case the stimuli were causing discrimination difficulties they were changed for the following experiment to horizontal and vertical light stimuli.  Experiment two used the horizontal and vertical light stimuli to further test DMTS in possums.  The possum's responding stayed at 50 percent correct, or chance, so the task was changed to a Simultaneous-Choice procedure.  However, this did not have any effect on improving their results with responding accuracy remaining at 50 percent correct.  Experiment three involved a conditional discrimination procedure, which was implemented to find out whether the possums could in fact discriminate between a horizontal and vertical light.  All the possums in this experiment reached 80 percent correct overall and at responding to either a horizontal or vertical light.  These results are enough to conclude that it was not the stimuli used in the previous two experiments which that had been causing the difficulties but the task itself.  It is not known exactly why the possums were so unsuccessful in performing a DMTS or MTS task.  More research into DMTS in possums in greatly needed and would offer a better understanding of the results of this study.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">possums</field><field name="subject">DMTS</field><field name="subject">short term remembering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Historicising the Feminist: A Study of Mary Wollstonecraft's Political and Discursive Contexts</field><field name="creator">McDougall, Charlotte</field><field name="description">This thesis has investigated the life and publications of Mary Wollstonecraft. The thesis is divided in to three chapters the first chapter explores the political and social context of late Eighteenth century England in which Wollstonecraft lived the majority of her life. It then moves on to discuss the 'Revolution Controversy' and Wollstonecraft's contribution to that debate. Giving specific attention to A Vindication of the Rights of Man as it is Wollstonecraft's first political publication, and was the first published response to Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France. Without first publishing A Vindication of the Rights of Man, Wollstonecraft could not have published her most famous work. Next the second chapter investigates Eighteenth century education, and how Wollstonecraft ideas on changing the nature of education would help reform society in her eyes. Education was recognized as having special significance by many Enlightenment philosophers, this thesis looks at the contribution of John Locke and Jean Jacques Rousseau to educational theory, and they ways in which Wollstonecraft responded to their ideas. In the final chapter the inclusive nature of Wollstonecraft's gender theory is considered. Wollstonecraft is widely recognised as publishing what became for many the founding document of modern western feminism. What is given less recognition is that Wollstonecraft was in fact interested in broad social reform, similar to many other Enlightenment philosophers, Wollstonecraft's social theory included changing education and socialisation for both women and men. Society could not be reformed without changing social and educational practices with regard to both II men and women. Wollstonecraft furthered the contemporary debate on the rights of man to include the rights of woman. Wollstonecraft criticised the unnatural distinctions of gender and class, setting out in both Vindications the negative consequences for the character of both men and women. Another less recognised aspect of Wollstonecraft's philosophy which this thesis has highlighted is the vital role that religion played, and its implications for her ideas. This aspect of Wollstonecraft's thought has tended to be over looked by many Wollstonecraft scholars, who try to place Wollstonecraft in some kind of political and social continuum which I think misses the revolutionary and far sighted nature of Wollstonecraft's philosophy. In taking a historicist approach or understanding to Wollstonecraft, by reading Wollstonecraft in the terms of the political and social environment of the late eighteenth century, it becomes easier to understand the radical nature of Wollstonecraft's ideas, and the personal hardships she faced as both a woman and a member of the lower middle class.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wollstonecraft</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing oral comprehension and emotional recognition skills in children with autism: A comparison of video self modelling with video peer modelling</field><field name="creator">Koretz, Jasmine May</field><field name="description">Video modelling has been shown to be an effective intervention with autistic individuals as it takes into account autistic characteristics of those individuals. Research on video self modelling and video peer modelling with this population has shown both are effective. The purpose of this study was to replicate past findings that video modelling is an effective strategy for autistic individuals, and to compare video self modelling with video peer modelling, to determine which is more effective. The studies here used multiple baselines with alternating treatments designs with 6 participants across two target behaviours; emotional recognition and oral comprehension. The first compared the video modelling methods and found neither method increased the target behaviours to criterion, for 5 out of the 6 participants. For 1 participant the criterion was only reached for the video self modelling condition for the target behaviour 'oral comprehension'. The second study first examined the effectiveness of video self modelling and video peer modelling with supplementary assistance for 4 participants. Second, it examined a new peer video for a 5th participant, and third, it compared the two video modelling methods (with supplementary assistance). Results indicated 1 participant reached the criterion in both video modelling conditions, 1 participant showed improvements and 2 participants never increased responding. This study indicated that clarity of speech produced by the peer participant in the peer video, may have contributed to a participant's level of correct responding. This is because a new peer video used during the second study dramatically increased this participants responding. Intervention fidelity, generalisation and follow-up data were examined.

There was suspicion that ferrets could detect the infrared light-emitting equipment used to monitor predator and prey behaviour. A two-alternative forced-choice operant procedure was used to test whether five pigmented male ferrets could detect infrared (870 and 920 nm) light. First, the ferrets were taught to press a lever under a lit visible (white) light emitting diode (LED) for food rewards. After up to 101 40-minute sessions, each ferret could lever press under the lit-light at or above the pass criteria of 75% responses over four consecutive (or five out of six) sessions. The same ferrets were then tested for stimulus generalisation over different stimulus properties by changing the wavelength/colour and intensity of the lit-light. The overall mean accuracy of each ferret's response to each coloured light varied between 92% and 84%. When a red light was systematically dimmed to halve the intensity nine times, all five ferrets still met the set pass criteria with overall accuracies of between 88% and 78%. This indicated that changing the properties of the light stimuli would not disrupt the ferrets' abilities to perform the learned task. This test was a necessary prerequisite before changing the light stimuli to potentially invisible wavelengths in the infrared spectrum. The light stimulus was changed to a single infrared (870) nm LED. Two of five ferrets showed strong evidence (response accuracies of 77%   4 and 72%   2) and one ferret showed weak evidence (60%   3) that they could see the light at this wavelength. Extraneous cues such as ultrasound emitted at the onset of a stimulus light or a predictable schedule of reinforcement were eliminated as potential response cues. These tests helped to prove that the ferrets were using only the light stimulus to discriminate which stimulus was lit. It may be possible that at least some feral ferrets can detect the light produced from infrared monitoring equipment that emits light wavelengths at or below 870 nm. This has significant implications for conservation because infrared equipment is used by conservation agencies in New Zealand and overseas to monitor predator and prey behaviour in the wild. If the infrared lighting is detected by the subject being observed, then it may potentially influence the behaviour of the animal, or attract a predator towards threatened native species.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ferret</field><field name="subject">ferrets</field><field name="subject">vision</field><field name="subject">infra-red</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">pest</field><field name="subject">Mustela furo</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Useful Elements of Pre-principalship Preparation</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Barry Llewellyn</field><field name="description">Abstract  The importance of the role of the principal in good schools is acknowledged by many sources. The preparation of new principals is therefore an important factor in ensuring children are educated in good schools. New Zealand does not have a formal system of principal preparation. The purpose of this study was to examine the experiences of pre-principalship preparation with the aim of discovering those activities and developments that were useful in assisting teachers to make the transition to successful principalship. The research question addressed in this study is,; What are the elements of pre-principalship preparation that are most useful for potential and aspiring principals in furthering their career aims? Using qualitative methodology, a group of people who had attended the Aspiring and Potential Principals' Pilot run by the School of Education at the University of Waikato, were questioned using semi structured interviews about their experiences. Five of the six were holding principal positions, the sixth was in a deputy principal's position and had some relieving principal experience. The results the research generated indicated that while there were varying needs for potential principals because of their varied backgrounds, there were six useful experiences for all identified. These included, attendance at some form of targeted principal preparation programme, a background of ongoing professional learning, developing networks, developing successful mentoring, experience of models of principalship and support of 'family'. Different people had different levels of benefit from these experiences but they were common to all. It is hoped that this research will give assistance to guiding professional development for the potential and aspiring principals of tomorrow.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mentoring</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">networking</field><field name="subject">professional learning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping the Geographical and Literary Boundaries of Los Angeles: A Real and Imagined City</field><field name="creator">Granville, Scott</field><field name="description">In Los Angeles, the influence of Hollywood and the film industry, combined with a non-stop barrage of media images, has blurred the line between the real and imaged.  The literature reveals a city exploding with cultural, racial and social differences, making Los Angeles a confusing and alienating place. The literature of Los Angeles reflects the changing face of the city. Los Angeles was always a city with a promising future, economic booms and optimism seemed to suggest that here was a place where the American Dream really could come true. Thousands travelled west in search of sunshine, oranges and a life that formerly, they could only dream of having. Yet, the literature of Los Angeles has highlighted the city's actual history together with a realization of undercurrents of violence, prejudice, depression and shattered dreams.  The past, present and future is used to reveal a city that is in stark opposition to the Los Angeles, waves of immigrants came to find.  This thesis explores the idea of the dreamer coming west to Los Angeles within the literature and the variety of ways in the travellers' romantic notions of Los Angeles as a city of promise, is betrayed, leaving a desperate people in its wake.  The literature shows that beneath the shiny surface of a city founded on sunshine and prosperity, corruption reached all levels of society and the 'mean streets' abound.	Later, influenced by an overwhelming feeling of powerlessness caused by Post-war nuclear depression, McCarthyism, loss of identity, and living in a city fragmented by racial tension and an ever growing gap between the very rich and the very poor, the literature of Los Angeles reflects not only the fears of that city, but of American society as a whole.  The collision of technology, rapid progression and population explosion turned Los Angeles into a disconnected city, where the real and imagined merge in a cityscape that demonstrates a conflicting combination of historical replication, original design and movie-set inspiration.  Nothing is ever what it appears to be in Los Angeles.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Los Angeles</field><field name="subject">literature of Los Angeles</field><field name="subject">Hollywood</field><field name="subject">hard-boiled detective</field><field name="subject">film noir</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2359</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Hydration on Enzyme Activity and Dynamics</field><field name="creator">Lopez, Murielle</field><field name="description">Water has long been assumed to be essential for biological function. To understand the molecular basis of the role of water in protein function, several studies have established a correlation between enzyme activity and hydration level. While a threshold of hydration of 0.2 h (grams of water per gram of dried protein) is usually accepted for the onset of enzyme activity, recent works show that enzyme activity is possible at water contents as low as 0.03 h (Lind et al., 2004). Diffusion limitation in these experiments was avoided by monitoring enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of gas-phase esters. However, since water is also a substrate for the enzyme used in these experiments, they cannot be used to probe the possibility of activity at zero hydration. However, the pig liver esterase and C. rugosa lipase B are able to catalyse alcoholysis reactions in which an acyl group is transferred between an ester and an alcohol. Therefore, by following this reaction and using a gas phase catalytic system, we have been able to show that activity can occur at 0 g/g. These results led to the question of the accuracy of determinations of very low water concentrations; i.e., how dry is 0 g/g? Although gravimetric measurements of the hydration level do not allow us to define the anhydrous state of the protein with sufficient sensitivity, using 18O-labeled water, we have been able to quantify the small number of water molecules bound to the protein after drying, using a modification of the method of Dolman et al. (1997). Testing different drying methods, we have been able to determine a level of hydration as low as 2 moles of water per mole of protein (equivalent to 0.0006 h in the case of pig liver esterase) and have shown that in the case of the pig liver esterase, activity can occur at this hydration level. At the molecular level, if the hydration level affects activity, we can expect an effect on the protein dynamics. Neutron scattering spectra of hydrated powders, for instance, show that diffusive motions of the protein increase with the hydration (Kurkal et al., 2005) To address the question of the protein motions involved in the onset of enzyme activity at low hydration, we performed neutron scattering experiments on a pico-second time scale on dried powders. Preliminary results show a dynamical transition at hydration levels as low as 3 h. Molecular dynamic simulations have also been used in this study to access the dynamics of the active site. Overall, the results here show that pig liver esterase can function at zero hydration, or as close to zero hydration as current methods allow us to determine. Since the experimental methodology restricts this work to a small number of enzymes, it is unlikely that it will ever be possible to determine if all enzymes can function in the anhydrous state: however, the results here indicate that water is not an obligatory requirement for enzyme function.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">protein hydration</field><field name="subject">protein dynamics</field><field name="subject">gas phase catalysis</field><field name="subject">alcoholysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Education for Authentic Democracy: Capatilism, Oppression, and Freire's Critical Pedagogy for Liberation</field><field name="creator">Walker, Talia Laureen</field><field name="description">Within the parameters of western ideology the concept of democracy is frequently upheld as a corner stone to which our moral, social, political and educational practices are anchored. The term has become a powerful instrument of persuasion in the public forums as the innate goodness of democracy has become more unquestionably ingrained in the historical imaginations of its citizens. As the logic surrounding the value placed on democracy is entwined with the virtues of freedom and self-determination for all, this is hardly surprising. What remains often unexplored in these public forums, however, is whether this logic is in fact justified. To situate the investigation into the current political arena is to acknowledge the dichotomy by which the philosophies of democracy and capitalism are publicly claimed to exist side by side. Such an acknowledgement forcefully yields one to the questions of to what extent our current ideologies of democracy, and the perpetuation of this dogma through our education system, can successfully result in producing an authentic democratic society within capitalist constructs.  This thesis has been written in an attempt to expose the contradiction present between our current political claims of democracy and our capitalist directed practices of education through the critical philosophy of Paulo Freire. Freire has firmly established himself as a respected democratic educator, however, my intention has not been to reduce his educational pedagogy by adapting it to attempt to improve the current system of schooling, as I argue is frequently found within educational literature, but rather to differentiate his democratic philosophy of education as the practice of freedom from the capitalist concept of education as a tool of domination and domestication.  I argue that the logic of transnational capitalism, which dictates the policies and practices of our education system, is detrimental to the development of the peoples' critical thinking facilities and thus negates their individual and collective empowerment. Such a system of banking education actively denies people the right to participate in history as subjects and inhibits the possibility of an authentic democracy. In this way the capitalist education system is in fact a system of oppression. Through Freire's critical pedagogy I argue that the transference ofknowledge through an authoritarian system does not constitute as education but is instead a training ground for workers set up in the interests of capitalist employers. Social class divisions are maintained and enforced by means of a paternalistic apparatus of hierarchy.  In supporting Freire's philosophy, and acknowledging the entirely political nature of education, I argue that an education system that would support an authentic democracy would have to practice authentic democracy. Through the concepts of 'promblematization', dialogue, critical transitivity and praxis I have attempted to refute the fatalistic assumptions that such an education system is unconceivable or unexplainable. Indeed, I argue that if our goal is to live in a democracy then such concepts are unavoidable.  The historical case study from the history of the New Zealand education system is included to illustrate the theory in practice. Here I argue that the intentions, practices and policies of the legislators were anti-democratic and anti-educational in that they constructed a compulsory system that is detrimental to the development of critical thought, self determination and dialogical knowing that is necessary to allow each member of society to be part of the governing system. By examining the consequences and legacy of this system it is possible to expose its influences in the larger educational realm in society. It is not my intention to simply present New Zealand education as an isolated case which requires examination but rather as a prominent example of how Freire's philosophy applies to traditional education in the west.  This thesis is therefore aimed at re-defining the concepts of democracy and education through critically examining the socio-economic conditions necessary for effective and equal participation in democratic forums. By critiquing the current system via the vehicle of Freire's philosophy, a prominent democratic educator, the divide between democracy as an illusion and as a reality becomes clearer.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">capatilism</field><field name="subject">democracy</field><field name="subject">Freire</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Real (Wo)man's Beer: gendered spaces of beer drinking in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hardy, Nicole Amy</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the ways in which rural, national, and urban spaces become gendered through the practices and representations of beer drinking in New Zealand. Critical social theory combined with feminist poststructuralist debates on identities provides the theoretical framework for this research. Two focus groups with P&#257;keh&#257; beer drinkers aged between 18 - 30 years old were conducted; one consisting of six males and the other consisting of six females. Critical textual analysis was also undertaken on five beer advertisements representing the most popular beer brands in New Zealand; Tui, Lion Red, Waikato and Speight's. Three points frame the analysis. First, I examine rural and national gendered identities associated with beer drinking. New Zealand's beer drinking cultures are constructed within rural discourses of masculinity. There is not a single masculinity present in New Zealand's beer drinking cultures, rather there are multiple and conflicting masculinities. I suggest that through the need to constantly perform their identity, men create a rural hegemonic masculinity that is both hard, yet vulnerable. I argue that the femininities constructed within these spaces are used to enhance and further enable the hard, yet vulnerable, rural masculinity.  Second, within urban spaces of beer drinking - such as the office, nightclub, clubrooms and home - homosexuals, metrosexuals and women are 'othered'. These identities are defined in relation to the hegemonic norm - 'Hard Man' masculinity - in negative ways. Furthermore, some women perform a hyper masculine identity in order to be included in these beer-drinking spaces.  Finally, I examine the ways in which hegemonic gendered identities in rural, national and urban spaces may be resisted and subverted. I use contradictions from my focus group participants to unsettle the 'Hard Man' masculinity of New Zealand's beer drinking cultures.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">beer</field><field name="subject">masculinities</field><field name="subject">femininities</field><field name="subject">cultures</field><field name="subject">identities</field><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="subject">urban</field><field name="subject">space</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temporal and spatial variations of cyanobacteria in Karori Reservoir, Wellington</field><field name="creator">Prentice, Matthew James</field><field name="description">The Lower Karori Reservoir (LKR) is a small, monomictic lake of 2.34 ha situated in the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary (KWS), Wellington.  Over the past decade cyanobacterial blooms have become a common occurrence in this water body.  In 2005 Anabaena planktonica was detected for the first time in the LKR and this species now forms dense blooms during summer.  These blooms are problematic as they reduce aesthetic appeal and have resulted in odour problems for visitors to this high profile wildlife sanctuary.  The objectives of this study were to identify key physical, chemical and biological variables influencing phytoplankton dynamics in the LKR and to use ecological models to investigate plausible management options.  The key parameters investigated, that may cause bloom formation were; summer stratification, high nutrient levels, and the food web effects of a large population of European perch (Perca fluviatilis). High resolution sampling was carried out every six hours over a 72 hour period during pre-bloom, bloom and post-bloom periods in 2006/7 to elucidate short term temporal and spatial variations in biological and physico-chemical parameters.  Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) was used to enumerate A. planktonica populations, allowing a large number of samples to be simultaneously evaluated.  Algal densities were also estimated using conventional phytoplankton enumeration and chlorophyll a analysis.  Water samples were collected for nutrient analysis at discrete depths and profiles were taken for temperature, dissolved oxygen and photosynthetic active radiation.  Secchi depth and pH were also measured.  Weekly or fortnightly phytoplankton and zooplankton samples and physical variables have been collected at LKR since September 2005 as part of an independent sampling program carried out by the KWS, Waikato University and Cawthron Institute.  In this project the 2-year data set was used to assist with analysis of lake processes and for validation of the hydrodynamic-ecological model DYRESM-CAEDYM.  Between 12 and 15 February, 2007, electric fishing was undertaken within the LKR.  A total of 3,946 P. fluviatilis were removed and the effects on phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations were investigated.  To increase knowledge of the physiology of A. planktonica, laboratory experiments were undertaken using cultures subjected to a range of different light intensities and temperature regimes The phytoplankton assemblage of the LKR shows very distinct temporal variations.  Summer stratification occurred in the LKR for ~4 months each summer.  During these periods A. planktonica comprised up to 99.9% of the surface phytoplankton population.  During isothermy chlorophytes, bacillariophytes and small flagellated dinophytes are co-dominant in the phytoplankton assemblage.  The results of the QPCR showed distinct diurnal vertical movement of A. planktonica, with the highest cell concentrations occurring at 1900 hours at the surface.  Ammonium (NH4-N) is the dominant species of inorganic nitrogen during periods of stratification, while nitrate (NO3-N) is generally dominant during times of isothermy.  Phosphate concentrations at surface and depth remained at low levels throughout the sampling period.  The large surface populations of A. planktonica, are probably responsible for the elevated total nitrogen concentrations in surface waters during stratified periods.  There appeared to be some short term effects of the P. fluviatilis removal with an increase in large crustaceans (e.g., Daphnia sp.) and a reduction in A. planktonica densities observed in the months following the P. fluviatilis removal.  Only a small proportion of the total P. fluviatilis population was removed and it is unlikely that the effects will be long-lasting without subsequent removal steps. However, it seems likely that P. fluviatilis is one of the factors contributing to cyanobacterial blooms and management of this fish species should be considered in future lake restoration plans.  Growth experiments indicated A. planktonica grow over a wide range of light intensities and temperatures, although highest growth rates were generally associated with higher temperatures (25  C) and light intensities (60 - 140 &#956;mol m-2 s-1).  Ecological and hydrodynamic trends within the LKR over a two year period were simulated with adequate success using the model DYRESM-CAEDYM.  Management scenarios simulated using DYRESM-CAEDYM suggest implementation of an artificial destratification system in the LKR may be the most practical and effective means of controlling A. planktonica blooms.  The addition of an artificial aeration system emitting air at a rate of approximately 50 l-1 s-1 should result in an isothermal system.  Without summer stratification some of the physiological features of A. planktonica (e.g., buoyancy regulation and nitrogen-fixation) that give it a competitive advantage over other phytoplankton species will be reduced.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Perca fluviatilis</field><field name="subject">Anabaena planktonica</field><field name="subject">Cyanobacteria</field><field name="subject">Temporal Variation</field><field name="subject">Spatial Variation</field><field name="subject">Karori Reservoir</field><field name="subject">Trophic Cascade</field><field name="subject">Biomanipulation</field><field name="subject">DYRESM-CAEDYM</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into the Effects of Oxidative Stress on Reproductive Development.</field><field name="creator">Collins, Tracey Helen</field><field name="description">Nuclear transfer (NT), or cloning, which is the transfer of a donor nucleus to a recipient enucleated oocyte, has been successfully achieved to produce viable offspring in many species.  The process is very inefficient, as reprogramming of the donor nucleus is required, and losses are high throughout development.  Placentation abnormalities are a common feature amongst cloned animals.  Incomplete nuclear reprogramming and erroneous epigenetic imprinting may contribute to aberrant protein transcription and DNA mutations, affecting mitochondrial metabolism and inducing cellular stress.  In vitro produced embryos under high oxygen culture conditions may also suffer oxidative stress, with the resulting reactive oxygen species causing mitochondrial DNA mutations and cellular stress similar to clones.  In this study, expression of oxidative stress protein markers (Hsp60, SOD2, Hsp70) in NT cotyledons were compared to artificial insemination (AI) at different time points of gestation (days 50, 100, and 150).  As a continuum of the oxidative stress investigation in cloned cotyledons, in vitro produced embryos were cultured under 20% oxygen compared to the control 7% oxygen laboratory standard culture, with oxidative stress protein markers examined between the groups at blastocyst stage (day 7) and day 15.  Embryo morphology was also observed to determine apparent physiological differences between the treatment and control embryos.  No previous studies to date have investigated the developmental effects of oxidative stress in day 15 bovine embryos. The significant differences in oxidative stress proteins observed at several time points in the NT and AI groups were not repeatable, possibly due to sample freeze/thaw degradation.  Morphological differences observed between embryos cultured in 20% oxygen and control groups were visually apparent, although not quantified.  At day 15 manganese superoxide dismutase expression was significantly lower in the 20% group compared to control.  The 20% oxygen group did not show higher heat shock protein 60 expression than control, however the same results have been observed in another study at blastocyst stage.  The results of this study suggest that the effect of oxidative stress on embryonic development is evident yet inconclusive in bovine NT cotyledons, however does not appear apparent in day 15 embryos following culture in 20% oxygen.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oxidative stress</field><field name="subject">mitochondria</field><field name="subject">clone</field><field name="subject">epigenetic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beauty and Truth: Re-defining Legal Artistry's Normative Aspirations</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Deidre Ann</field><field name="description">Abstract Judges are responsible for creating case law, and each case is important, because each develops (in theory) the body of law as a whole. Each judgment should be able to meet the definition of 'art' that I will set out and apply in this thesis. Where a judgment meets that test of art, it will be successful in relaying the 'truth' of the law in a rich, lasting and forceful manner. It is important for case law to relay the truth of the law in such a way because case law's function is to communicate and reinforce social values by recognising and applying universal principles of justice and fairness to situations that arise from social life. In summary, this thesis examines whether the each of the main cases that have developed the duty of care test in negligence meets the criteria in the definition of art set out in this work, so that they may be called works of art. Each of the relevant cases will be evaluated to see: whether each embodies a 'system of rules and principles' (rules and principles being separate concepts) as these relate to the duty of care test; and whether each may be called beautiful. For, a work of art is one that incorporates all of these aspects: rules, principles and beauty. I will define what art is, and I will describe art's function in the world. I will explore and define the concept of truth, as it relates to this thesis, and I will attempt to make clear the analogy between truth as Idea (in the Greek sense) and the law as Idea. Further, I will look at the context in which the judicial opinion is created, and I will consider the responsibilities judges have to reason by analogy under the doctrine of precedent. Then, I will consider the concept of beauty itself, and how it affects us as those who experience the work. Finally, I will show that the concept of 'duty of care' in negligence, leading up to and culminating in Lord Atkin's dictum in Donoghue v Stevenson (1932) AC 562 (HL), has been developed by judges so that only 50% of the cases considered meet the test of: a system of rules and principles governing that particular aspect of the law; and beauty. Thus, only the cases that meet the test will be considered to be successful in conveying the truth of the law (and allowing us to access that truth) in a rich, lasting and forceful manner, because this is art's function in the world.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">beauty</field><field name="subject">truth</field><field name="subject">art</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The confiscation of Pare Hauraki: The impact of Te Ao P&#257;keh&#257; on the Iwi of Pare Hauraki M&#257;ori; on the whenua of Pare Hauraki 1835-1997 and The Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004</field><field name="creator">Peters, Murray Hamaka</field><field name="description">Kia mau ki te rangatiratanga o te Iwi o Hauraki  Just as the whakatauk&#299;  explains  Hold fast to the power and authority of the Hauraki tribes  the focus of this study is to examine and evaluate the impact of Te Ao P&#257;keh&#257; on Pare Hauraki lands and T&#299;kapa Moana under the mana of Pare Hauraki M&#257;ori  and Pare Hauraki tikanga.

This is most evident today within comic book fan-communities online where the sexual identity of popular superheroes are continuously explored and debated in discussion forums and expressed through the production of slash fiction and queer-themed fan art. Indeed, the ambiguity inherent in superhero comics has traditionally allowed and encouraged fans to operate as 'textual poachers' (Jenkins, 1992) appropriating these texts for their own means. Today, however, there exist a new generation of comic book superheroes, in the form of the Young Avengers, Uncanny X-Men and The Authority, which contain established 'out' gay characters. This paper will examine the implications of these series on the practice of fandom by analyzing fan reactions and responses to the manner in which the industry has opted to present a gay relationship between its superhero characters Wiccan and Hulkling and, Apollo and The Midnighter. The meaning of the shift from the 'implied' to 'actual' is examined in terms of fans' acceptance, resistance and desire to further appropriate the text.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">superheroes</field><field name="subject">comics</field><field name="subject">queer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Delivery of a coated bioactive from a rumen controlled-release device</field><field name="creator">Syzov, Vladyslav</field><field name="description">Ruminants possess a unique digestive system. Using the high metabolic potential of the symbiotic microflora of the rumen, ruminants are capable of digesting plant material and obtaining nutrients and energy from this process. Because of the ruminal fermentation, the most bioactives are not stable in the harsh ruminal environment. Therefore there is a need to improve the bioavailability of a bioactive by protecting it from the ruminal digestion. The formulation of protected bioactive can be delivered in the rumen in a controlled manner and over a long period of time. In this project the degree of rumen protection was estimated using model substrates (sugar pellets and granules). These materials were coated with the pH-sensitive polymer Eudragit  E. The model bioactive (phloridizin) was coated using the coating methodology adopted from exploratory studies with model substrates. The bioavailability of  protected  (coated) phloridizin was assessed by administering directly into the abomasum of fistulated cows. Formulation of  protected  phloridizin was used to demonstrate the feasibility of bioactive controlled delivery based on ART ( Active Rumen Technology ). This technology uses an elevated gas pressure created by a hydrogen-producing cell to drive a plunger which extrudes bioactive formulation from an intraruminal controlled-release device. Four groups of devices filled with formulation containing different amounts of protected  phloridizin were tested. The bioactive was released in a controlled manner over several days. The formulation release profiles were reproducible suggesting that in principle the technology can be further developed to use in a commercial sense or for research purposes. The limitations of the technology, including formulation issues and gas diffusion through barrel walls, were identified.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eudragit E100</field><field name="subject">pan coating</field><field name="subject">phloridizin</field><field name="subject">rumen device</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quiet Activists - Environmental Values and Value Adjustment in Environmental Policy Advisors</field><field name="creator">Gr&#252;bmeyer, Sonja Felicitas</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I investigate the influence of environmental values on the work of environmental policy advisors in a regional council in New Zealand and the influence on the institutional values of their work environment on their personal environmental values.  Values are relatively stable concepts of socially acquired beliefs and norms that influence the perception and behaviour of humans and are organised in interdependent and dynamic structures that can be changed through social experiences. Environmental values are partly responsible for environmentally friendly behaviour, which encompasses a variety of activities and even lifestyle choices. People, who have chosen to work in the environmental sector are exposed to environmental values through working for institutions that represent environmentally friendly principles. By working in an environmental context, environmental values can get changed by social interaction, which can lead to an adjustment or approximation to the dominant notion of environmental values within the workplace (Finegan, 2000) Although policy advice is expected to be a neutral and objective task, statements are still written by persons with an individual opinion that, although suppressed, represents the values of the writer (Heineman, Bluhm, Peterson,  Keary, 2002). It is therefore likely that the whole process of evaluating information and preparing a policy recommendation is influenced by the values of the policy advisor.  My findings indicate that environmental values of employees get adjusted to the institution's environmental values through their work. This happens through a merging of their private environmental values into their professional values, through  processes of adjustment. This change not only results in identification with the job but also presents a way to circumvent possible value conflicts in the work environment. The policy process involves a number of stages where information is re-evaluated and discussed to fit the formal and structural requirements of policy making under the  Resource Management Act, which is done in collaboration with others. This leads to a social construction of values that are represented in collaboratively developed policy recommendation. In my conclusion, I show that policy advisors at regional government level use. in New Zealand have environmental values, use them for environmental protection, and adjust them to work more efficiently for the environment within a public service organisation. The use of their environmental values by the participants show that they are environmentalists and do what environmentalists do, but in a quiet, unobtrusive way.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="subject">Values</field><field name="subject">Policy</field><field name="subject">Environmentalism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative tolerances of non-indigenous bridled goby and native exquisite goby to salintiy, temperature and sediment</field><field name="creator">Theobald, Kylie</field><field name="description">The Australian bridled goby (Arenigobius bifrenatus) has been in New Zealand since 1996, and has subsequently spread to thirteen estuaries and the coastal Otara Lake. The native exquisite goby (Favonigobius exquisitus) may be displaced or threatened by the bridled goby as they share estuarine habitat. The ecophysiological tolerances and sediment preferences for both goby species were examined to determine the potential for niche overlap and habitat selection. The results of acute salinity and temperature tolerance tests supported the hypotheses that bridled gobies are more tolerant than exquisite gobies to extremes of salinity and temperature. The incipient ten day LT50 values were 6.7 C and 11.8 C for bridled and exquisite gobies, respectively, however, both tolerated temperatures up to 35 C. Both species showed some mortality at low salinities, but mortality did not exceed 50% for either species at the lowest salinity tested (2.2 ppt) after 96 h. Bridled gobies displayed a strong preference for fine sediment (less than 63 um), whereas exquisite gobies were less selective, accepting a broad range of sediment grain sizes (63-250 um).  Bridled gobies have successfully established and dispersed in New Zealand, and their ecophysiological adaptations that allowed them to survive harsh conditions in ballast water, their presumed introduction vector, will likely aid their future spread throughout New Zealand. Their increasing abundance is likely to see them encounter and possibly encroach on the habitat of exquisite gobies. Bridled gobies may displace the smaller exquisite gobies from optimal habitats, as exquisite gobies are unlikely to survive competition from and predation by bridled gobies. However, exquisite gobies should be able to relocate to adjacent habitat with coarse sediment that is unsuitable for burrow construction by bridled gobies. Additionally, acclimatisation to local environmental conditions may extend the tolerance limits determined in this thesis, and may allow bridled gobies to spread to upstream zones in estuaries and occupy freshwater.  New Zealand presently has eight recognised gobiid species of which one is endemic, two are native, two are not recorded in mainland waters and three are proposed as non-indigenous. Additionally, several tropical and subtropical gobies exist in the aquarium trade. Similar ecophysiological tests of tolerance and preference may determine the possibility that these species could establish in the wild following accidental release.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-indigenous</field><field name="subject">Arenigobius bifrenatus</field><field name="subject">Favonigobius exquisitus</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Policy to Practice: How are Schoools Catering for Gifted and Talented Students?</field><field name="creator">Ferguson, Miriam</field><field name="description">In 2005, the Ministry of Education in New Zealand released 'The Schooling Strategy, Making a Bigger Difference for all Students' (Ministry of Education, 2005). This is intended as a framework for ongoing effort and improvement in education for the five years from 2005 to 2010. One of the strategic priorities in this document, is to promote evidence-based practice. With evidence-based practice, teachers combine evidence from a number of sources to inform their professional judgements and practice. This includes research evidence about effective pedagogy. Teachers, it states, need to be supported to 'base their practice on principles of  what works  from research evidence and adapting it to their classroom context' (p.39). In looking at the practices of schools in catering for gifted and talented students, therefore, it is appropriate, to look at the findings of research. This research is useful in underpinning 'best practice'. This study reviews the literature concerning the education of gifted and talented children from both national and international perspectives. It then looks at current New Zealand practice, based on four case-study primary schools. There are very encouraging signs that these schools are well into the journey of catering for their gifted and talented students. Each school in this study has responded to the challenge of provision as best it can, within constraints of individual school situations. Each school also sees the development of this provision as an ongoing process. From Term 1, 2005, all state and state integrated schools must be able to show how they are meeting the needs of their gifted and talented learners. The main findings of this study suggest that even before the amendment to this National Administration Guideline (NAG) 1(iii)c, there were some promising and effective provisions for gifted and talented children within schools. These included school-wide and withdrawal provisions. However, since the change to the NAG and the involvement of schools in gifted and talented professional development courses, there has been increased awareness of the need for classroom teachers to differentiate their programmes in order to more effectively cater for this group of learners. New Zealand primary school classrooms with a learner centred philosophy appear to be well suited to programme differentiation. There is increasingly an emphasis within general teaching practice on individualizing programmes based on assessment data which clearly shows where the child is at, and what the next learning step will be. Current professional development contracts promoting practices such as inquiry learning, curriculum integration and thinking skills seem to have particular promise for this group of learners. It is very evident, however, that a lack of time and energy is a significant barrier for classroom teachers wishing to provide for the specific needs of gifted and talented learners. It is also suggested that some schools, in particular low decile and small rural schools, may be unfairly disadvantaged in their ability to provide for gifted and talented learners. The challenge for schools now, it is suggested, is to continue the journey towards a school-wide commitment to best practice in providing for this group of learners. Special consideration for this group of learners should be integrated into the context of all pre-service training and in-service professional development, as part of a differentiated programme for all learners. A vital component of this is ongoing practical support for teachers based on their expressed need, to enable them to effectively translate theory into practice, and thus implement and embed any appropriate approach, based on research findings, effectively.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gifted and talented education</field><field name="subject">New Zealand school practice in gifted and talented education</field><field name="subject">gifted and talented education practice</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate Social Responsibility Indexes: Measure for Measure</field><field name="creator">Timperley, Stephen</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates criteria used by research agencies that publish ratings of business organisations in respect of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance and the relationship of these criteria to underlying ethical principles.  Companies are rated according to CSR criteria.  Observation of different rating agencies' results for the same, or similar organisations, shows a significant variation in results.  Variations in rating must result either from different criteria being applied or from criteria addressing similar topics being assessed in a different way.  Criteria from different rating agencies are found to be comparable.  Thus if rating criteria are derived from an ethical view of the responsibilities of business organisations, then inconsistent results may be explained by variations in the ethical basis of corporate social responsibility used by agencies.  Subject companies are rated under broad categories such as corporate governance, human rights and the environment.  These categories contain specific criteria.  My investigation compares the criteria used by major rating agencies and identifies the ethical basis, if any, that can be attributed to each criterion.  The study finds that there are clearly identifiable links between a number of criteria used by each rating agency and the ethical theories selected for evaluation.  Further, there is sufficient difference between the agencies to characterise each in relation to one or more of the ethical theories selected.  There is inconsistency, however, within each agency's basis of principles as well as between agencies, which indicates an unsatisfactory lack of explicit relationship between the general, and reasonably consistent, definition of corporate social responsibility and application of coherent ethical principles.  In practical terms around 10% of all investments in the United States, representing 2.3 trillion dollars, are invested in ethical or screened funds that rely on these and similar rating agencies results to determine CSR performance of firms.  The large variation in results demonstrated in my thesis suggests that very significant financial decisions are based, at least in part, on inconsistent data.   I suggest in my conclusion that if agencies were to consider, justify and clearly state the ethical basis from which their criteria derive, then investment managers and their clients could be more certain that their CSR principles were being upheld.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CSR</field><field name="subject">business ethics</field><field name="subject">indexes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The learning experiences and preferred teaching strategies of children who have been identified as Gifted with ADHD</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Kylee</field><field name="description">This qualitative study investigated the educational and social experiences of six children who had been identified as Gifted with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  The children were aged from six to ten years old.  Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the children and their parents and a staff member of the George Parkyn Centre (now The Gifted Education Centre) to explore their educational and social experiences in order to identify their preferred strategies that were also expected to be the most effective educational strategies.  It is important to identify effective educational strategies for Gifted children with ADHD.  This is because there are children in New Zealand (as this study has found) who have been identified as Gifted with ADHD but according to the literature review conducted for this study there does not appear to be a significant amount of  literature from New Zealand or international writers that informs educators about how to assist these children to learn.  Instead, the literature appeared to focus on misdiagnosis of Giftedness as ADHD, however, these children may benefit from having assistance with their learning as some literature suggested they are not being identified and could be underachievers.  It seems that the use of effective educational strategies may be the only way these children could reach their academic potential.  Therefore, this study sought to move on from the misdiagnosis debate evident in the Gifted/ADHD literature to identify some effective educational strategies.  This study also investigated the social experiences of Gifted children with ADHD.  This is because the literature maintained Gifted children with ADHD could have difficulties with social interactions.  Talking to the children about their social interactions could indicate whether the literature's implications are correct and if they are it should allow further understanding regarding how we could assist the Gifted child with ADHD to have more positive social interactions that could also positively impact on learning as social interactions occur within the classroom.  The key findings of this study indicated that some Gifted children with had specific learning preferences that could stimulate them to learn (e.g., when their interests were recognised, information was presented visually, tasks had a meaningful purpose and movement and use of computers was allowed).  Ineffective educational strategies were also addressed although not in detail as for the most part they seemed to be the opposite of effective educational strategies.  The findings also indicated Gifted children with ADHD could benefit when they find their 'true peer' as this seemed to result in the children within this study wanting to work with others.  Although specific suggestions were recommended (e.g., the use Renzulli's 1977 Enrichment Triad Model) the findings emphasised the depth of information that could be gained by simply talking to children and their parents about their learning.  A wider implication may be this Gifted group of children may benefit from the use of specific educational strategies that personalise their learning.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gifted</field><field name="subject">Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</field><field name="subject">ADHD</field><field name="subject">educational strategies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2373</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a Better Understanding of Coastal Cliff Erosion in Waitemata Group Rock; Auckland, New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Bell, Jessica Emily</field><field name="description">The soft sedimentary deposits of the Waitemata Group which outcrop on the eastern coastline of the Auckland region are a coastal cliff erosion hazard. The determination of the rate that these cliffs erode for hazard zonation purposes still requires research. A database has been collated of a range of structural, geological, geomorphic and climate parameters from 16 representative cliff sites in order to statistically assess what parameters influence cliff erosion and why erosion rates vary within the relatively uniform geology. Four different lithological units have been defined: sandstone beds of turbidites; sandstone beds of densites (contain rip-up clasts); sand to gravel beds of debrites; and siltstone beds. Cliff rock has very weak to weak intact rock strength; apertures of 0.1 to 15 mm; infill types are soft clay and grit, and hard calcite and iron; spacing of discontinuities are smaller in siltstone beds (&#8805; 5 mm), and up to 5 m in sandstone and debrite beds; bedding and fault planes are continuous, joints are non-continuous; block size is dictated by bed thickness and non-continuous joints. Shore platform widths were used to determine long-term erosion rates which range from 1.2 to 53.0 mm y-1. Platform morphologies are either sloping or horizontal or are a combination of both. Higher platform benches found at some sites are considered to be the result of a higher period of sea-level or are high-tide benches. Intact and rock mass strength increases northwards. Cliff heights are 8 to 38 m; cliff angles are 51 to 79 . Conditions for sporadic planar and wedge failure were determined at some sites; frittered siltstone and low durability sandstone allow smaller-scale, continual erosion. Castor Bay, Army Bay, Waiwera Beach and Leigh Marine Reserve have the lowest rock mass quality. Musick Point, Narrowneck Beach and Waiake Bay have good rock mass quality.  A conceptual model for coastal cliff erosion has been developed for Waitemata Group coastal cliffs, based on the dominant processes that act on the cliffs determined from statistical analysis (student t-test, correlation and regression) and field observations. The primary factor for cliff erosion is bed dip, whereby seaward dipping beds have higher erosion rates than landward dipping beds. The secondary factors for cliff erosion include: the intact and rock mass strength of the rock; the rock mass quality; strength of the siltstone beds; strength and structure of the sandstone beds; and orientation of the bedding planes with respect to the cliff face. Shear stresses are enhanced when beds dip seaward and thus shear failure along continuous surfaces is achievable. When beds dip landward the influence of shear stresses along bedding planes, and their contribution to the removal of individual blocks of rock, is severely inhibited resulting in reduced rates of erosion.  There is no relationship between cliff height and erosion rates and cliff heights are mainly controlled by the pre-existing landscape. Cliff angle is controlled by the proportion of sandstone and siltstone (whereby lower cliff angles are more siltstone-dominated), rock mass strength and weathering.  Erosion rates do vary in Waitemata Group rock of the Auckland region because of the variation in structural and geomorphic conditions of the cliff, most strongly controlled by the dip angle of bedding planes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Waitemata Group</field><field name="subject">flysch</field><field name="subject">cliff erosion</field><field name="subject">geotechnical</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrodynamic and water quality modelling of the lower kaituna river and maketu estuary</field><field name="creator">Goodhue, Nigel David</field><field name="description">The Maketu Estuary is a shallow intertidal estuary (2.3 km2) located in the Bay of Plenty, North Island, New Zealand. The Kaituna River contributes the largest freshwater flow into the estuary through control gates. Lake Rotoiti and indirectly Lake Rotorua supply the base flow to the Kaituna River, with tributaries along the 50 km reach also significantly contributing to the flow. Water quality within the river is affected by elevated nutrients, faecal coliforms, high oxygen demand and algae concentrations derived from the lakes as well as contributions from tributaries and industrial and urban discharge. Through the use of a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical numerical model ELCOM-CAEDYM, this study aims to examine the nutrient, phytoplankton and hydrodynamics of the Maketu Estuary and lower Kaituna River. Water quality and hydrodynamic measurements were sourced from Environment Bay of Plenty's data archives as well as a number of instrument deployments to collect water velocity, tidal elevation and salinity and temperature measurements during the course of this study. Included in the field work was a survey of the lower river and estuary bathymetry.  Model simulations predicted that the maximum residence time in the Maketu Estuary is 1.5 days, occurring in the inner western region.  Residence time in the lower river (mouth to 8.5 km upstream) is in the order of hours although some variations were predicted near the river mouth. Growth rates of four phytoplankton groups where assessed over a 15 day period in January 2004. In the Kaituna River ELCOM-CAEDYM predicted that the community growth rates were small with the exception of a slight increase in biomass of the two freshwater groups in a semi-detached river bend. The increase in the loop was correlated with an increase of residence time. In the estuary, marine diatoms showed the highest growth rates in the western region which is expected to relate to retention time and available nutrients. Dinoflagellates showed the smallest variation in predicted growth rates, most likely due to their broad salinity tolerance. The two freshwater species showed a reduction in abundance when mixed with marine water. A principle limiting factor to phytoplankton growth in both the river and estuary is the low residence time.  A number of scenarios were simulated in the river and estuary by altering the forcing conditions in the model. A simulation of the increased nutrient load associated with the Rotoiti diversion wall revealed that phytoplankton growth in the river and estuary will not be significantly affected. Because of the close proximity of the control gates to the river mouth, a proportion of water drawn through the structure can be marine. By opening the old river channel, model simulations predicted that a reduction in salinity would be possible, however the outcome of complete freshwater is probably not achievable. Increasing the discharge volume from the river into the estuary was also simulated. The results indicated that increasing the freshwater inflow at Fords Cut would reduce the salinity in the estuary while increasing the net (residual) flow towards the estuary mouth. Increasing the flow would also result in a greater range of salinity in regions of the estuary. Changing the inflow location to the historic Papahikahawai Channel also affected the salinity in the estuary. The most significant effect of an inflow at this location was a reduction of the residual currents in the western region of the estuary.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">numerical</field><field name="subject">ELCOM</field><field name="subject">CAEDYM</field><field name="subject">phytoplankton</field><field name="subject">eutrophication</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relation Between Preference and Demand in the Domestic Hen: Does Preference Vary With Price?</field><field name="creator">Bruce, Julie-Anne Marie</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT  Six hens responded under an increasing Fixed Ratio schedule of reinforcement to assess demand separately for two different food types: wheat and puffed wheat.  Demand curves generated showed the least preferred food, puffed wheat, yielded a higher initial (ln L) demand than the more preferred food, wheat.  While responding for the more preferred food, wheat, produced lower initial (ln L) demand functions, responding for wheat was maintained to higher increasing FR schedules of reinforcement than was that for puffed wheat.  This phenomenon occurred across all six hens.  To assess preference between the two food types the hens responded under a two-link concurrent-chain schedule of reinforcement.  Under the concurrent-chain schedule of reinforcement there were three conditions, each consisted of a initial link with VI 90-s VI 90-s in effect, and terminal links of FR1, FR8 and FR32.  The concurrent-chain schedule was used to examine if or how preference may relate to demand.  Preference measures obtained showed wheat was generally preferred to puffed wheat across all prices throughout the preference assessment.  As price increased in the terminal link during the preference assessment, preference for wheat became more extreme as did the hens responding.  The results suggest that while there is a systematic relation between preference and demand, in that at higher FR values food with higher demand levels is preferred.

The process of supporting young people to develop the desire and the confidence to recognise personal potential and to manage their ongoing learning is a priority. Communication and collaboration are key to learners becoming informed active participants in their own learning and experiencing successful outcomes in today's society.  Our old models of learning where pre packaged parcels of knowledge were delivered to students by teachers will no longer suffice. As we respond to the new meaning of knowledge in the 21st century and begin to view knowledge as an active process, it is clear that many of the top down structures and organisational practices present in New Zealand secondary schools need change. The idea of personalisation in order to support independent learners to reach their potential is a familiar one for many teachers and is one of the ideals which may have brought them into the teaching profession. However, the institutional contexts in which they operate can act not as a driving force for personalised learning but as a barrier to it. In seeking to find one possible way in which secondary school systems can be re shaped around the needs of the learner, this study examines the role of online mentoring with experts outside the school.  This small scale qualitative study uses ethnographic methods to gather data from twelve secondary school year thirteen physical education students and their teacher as they engage in an eight week online project with expert sports coaches at Auckland University of Technology. Eleven of the students were boys. In examining the impact which online mentoring might have on this group of learners and their teacher, rich data was collected via web transcripts, observation, image data and interviews.  The research findings reveal that students found a high degree of satisfaction with the process and placed value on having the opportunity to pursue personalised goals as they worked with mentors in a collaborative online environment. Teacher behaviour and practice underwent change in the project with the teacher becoming repositioned within the group in the role of learner. In a process where authoritarian approaches were replaced by collaborative group action and inquiry, students reported an enhanced ability to think deeply, to manage their own learning and to relate in highly skilled ways with others. Students' perceptions about the ways in which they were working were analysed using the New Zealand Curriculum Key Competencies.  As students focused their inquiry past the level of curriculum goals and onto real world personal goals, several experienced a shift in perception concerning their own learning potential and expressed surprised at their own level of competence. The fact that eleven out of the twelve students were boys makes this shift in personal learning expectation worthy of further investigation in the quest for improving academic outcomes for boys.  Finally, this study may have relevance for the ways in which the Key Competencies have meaning in secondary schools. The study demonstrated that the emergence of competencies such as self management and relating to others was assisted by changes in teacher behaviour and action. As authoritarian approaches were replaced by a collaborative model where independent learning with others was supported, learners began to exhibit the personal competencies described by the New Zealand Curriculum (2008). These competencies which include Thinking, Using Language, symbols and texts, Managing self, Relating to others and Participating and contributing occurred as a natural consequence of  a learning model which was shaped to fit the learner; a personalised approach to learning with support from online mentors.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personalised learning</field><field name="subject">web 2.0</field><field name="subject">21st century teaching and learning</field><field name="subject">online mentors</field><field name="subject">collaboration</field><field name="subject">NZ Curriculum key competencies</field><field name="subject">teacher learning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A flexible suite of programs for modelling the cortex with a mean-field scheme</field><field name="creator">Chang, Yuan-Kuei</field><field name="description">The cerebral cortex contains many neurons. The neuron is part of the nervous system and it receives and transmits the electrical signals. These signals are significant to a human's behaviour. Since the neurons are charged, these charges produce electrical fields, so these neural signals can be measured by using scalp electrodes in electroencephalography (EEG). As long as the brain is not dead, the spontaneous activities of neurons will produce a series of EEG signals. There are many models that have been developed for simulating the cortical signal, and mostly each model is focused towards a different purpose or application. Often, a different computer code has to be written for each different application, and this can be inefficient. Therefore, this project aims to develop a software system for simulating cortical signals where the model used for the system can be changed easily. Furthermore, the system is requested to be versatile and easy-to-use for many applications. The developed system is written in MATLAB in response to a user requirement and mostly applies to any model which uses a mean-field approach. Only the specific inputs need to be modified for changing the model. This thesis details how this system is developed. The main limitation of the system is computational resources, much the same as other cortical modelling. However, all the user requirements had been satisfied. The system can simulate the response of the neurons for any condition and generate simulated EEG data to the user. The user can analyze the cortical activities using the standard signal processing techniques such as a power spectrum. This software is very helpful for the research of sleep and anaesthesia.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cortex modelling</field><field name="subject">mean-field</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2378</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seen but not heard: Women's experiences of educational leadership in Solomon Islands secondary schools</field><field name="creator">Akao, Shalom Maiasi</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with the representation of women in leadership positions in Solomon Islands. In particular, it explores the educational leadership experiences of women working in Solomon Islands' secondary schools. While much research to date has been carried out in the developed and developing countries, very little has been undertaken in Melanesian countries. As such, we know very little about women's experiences in educational leadership in Melanesia. Research data was gathered using qualitative methods. Specifically, interviews were conducted with eight women, five were deputy principals and three were Heads of Departments. All the participants were teaching in schools in an urban centre. Data gathered were analyzed using the thematic analysis approach. The data gathering was conducted in the Solomon Islands in October 2007. The key findings revealed a number of issues that impacted on the women's leadership in their respective schools. Findings include lack of self confidence, difficulties in balancing work and family, discriminatory attitudes and the influence of the cultural patriarchal norms on the attitudes towards women in leadership positions. Other key findings related to the nature of the organization, in this case, the school. This included a lack of initial preparatory and on - going professional development programmes and a lack of consultation in the decision making process. This study also found that while the women embraced the collaborative approach to leadership, the structural barriers through the hierarchical organization of the schools meant they could not lead the way they would like to.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">educational leadership</field><field name="subject">Solomon Islands</field><field name="subject">secondary school</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2379</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and Evaluation of a Mobile Photo Gallery in TIP</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yi</field><field name="description">As a part of the Tourist Information Provider (TIP) system, this project focuses on creating a photo gallery service in the TIP system, which allows users to share, browse and categorize their photos. The core of this project is to provide users a location-based photo browsing. The system provides photos which are taken in the current user's location. We considered privacy control on photos that users uploaded. A photo owner is able to sign an access level to each of their photos and permit different users to access them. We also considered reusing resources. The system allows a user to use an URL of a photo in the system in stead of uploading the photo from the local computer. The system also provides a URL of each photo in order to use the photo on other web places, e.g., Blogs. We use tags and photo metadata Eixf to categorize photos.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mobile photo gallery</field><field name="subject">location-based</field><field name="subject">TIP</field><field name="subject">Tourist Information Provider</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pore water chemistry and early diagenesis in sediments of Lake Rotorua, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Motion, Olivia Jane</field><field name="description">To gain an understanding of the transfer of nutrients and trace elements from sediment pore waters to surface waters of eutrophic Lake Rotorua and the early diagenetic processes controlling the transfer, pore water chemistry in the sediments of Lake Rotorua was investigated over a one year period in 2006 by collection of sediment cores on three occasions and deployment of pore water equilibrators on two occasions. Pore water concentrations of Fe2+, Mn2+, S, PO4, NH4, As, Cd, and Pb were analysed. Phosphate and ammonium fluxes to the water column from the sediments were calculated from measured concentration gradients by Fick's law of diffusion. Gas present in the sediments was analysed for composition, and source, and its ebullition rate measured. Anaerobic oxidation of organic matter is indicated by negative Eh values. Sulfate reduction was indicated near the sediment-water interface and releases of Fe2+, Mn2+, PO4 and NH4 into the pore water from particulate material were associated with the reducing conditions. Peaks in concentration of nutrients and elements occurred at the sediment surface over summer and deeper in the pore water profile over the cooler months of May and September. Sampling with peepers at fine scales immediately above the sediment-water interface indicated the presence of a nepheloid layer where elements are actively being recycled. Sulfate reduction appears to occur in the layer above the sediment-water interface, indicating that dissolved oxygen has already been reduced. Phosphorus is possibly being removed by iron and manganese oxide/hydroxide precipitation 5 to 15 cm above the sediment-water interface. Pore water saturation calculations indicate that sulfides may be controlling concentrations of iron and possibly other metals in the pore water by formation of pyrite in the zone of sulfate reduction. Below the zone of sulfate reduction, siderite and vivianite may be precipitating and acting as an additional sink for iron and phosphorus. ii Nutrient release rates based on Fick's law of diffusion indicated 430 tonnes of dissolved phosphorus and 1150 tonnes of ammonium were released to Lake Rotorua's water column in 2006, suggesting nutrient release from the sediments is the dominant flux of nutrients to the water column of Lake Rotorua. Methanogenesis, from acetate fermentation, occurs below the zone of sulfate reduction, where it becomes the dominant process in organic matter degradation. Ebullition of gas was measured at 126 ml m-2 d-1 and this gas was comprised dominantly of methane. Possible remediation techniques that could reduce the internal load of nutrients released from the lake sediments include sediment removal by dredging or capping the sediments with an adsorbent or sealing layer. Capping the sediments could be compromised by ebullition of gas that would disrupt the capped layer, opening up pathways that allow more readily for exchange between pore water nutrients and the water column. Dredging is likely to stimulate the ebullition of most of the trapped gas and result in a rapid efflux of much of the nutrient rich pore water into the lake, however dredging the top 10 to 20 cm of the sediments may partially reduce phosphorus in the pore waters but would not substantially reduce ammonium and fluxes would remain similar to current levels. Improving redox conditions in the sediments could reduce pyrite formation improving phosphorus binding with iron.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pore water</field><field name="subject">early diagenesis</field><field name="subject">lake rotorua</field><field name="subject">sediments</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intellectual Capital Reporting by the New Zealand Local Government Sector</field><field name="creator">Schneider, Annika Barbara Sabine</field><field name="description">Sweeping financial management reforms occurred in New Zealand during the late 1980s and early 1990s which radically changed the face of the New Zealand public sector.  These reforms sought to significantly restructure and reorganise local government thereby improving their effectiveness and efficiency and improving their accountability to their stakeholders. The principal vehicle for the discharge of this accountability is the annual report, which must be prepared according to Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP) and commercial principles.  Organisations in the private sector are beginning to recognise the value of accounting for intellectual capital (IC) (see for example Quinn, 1992; Brooking, 1996; Sveiby, 1997; Edvinsson  Malone, 1997; Bontis, Dragonetti, Jacobsen  Roos, 1999; Guthrie, Petty  Johanson, 2001; Bounfour, 2003). Studies on the measurement, management and reporting of IC have been undertaken internationally in Asia (Abeysekera  Guthrie, 2005; Goh  Lim, 2004; Ordenez de Pablos, 2002), Australia (Guthrie  Petty, 2000), Europe (Bozzolan, Favotto and Ricceri, 2003; Olsson, 2001; Ordenez de Pablos, 2004), United Kingdom (Collier, 2001; Williams, 2001) and Ireland (Brennan, 2001). Despite the significant research interest in the field of intellectual capital internationally, scant attention has been paid to intellectual capital reporting by commercial organisations in New Zealand. An extensive review of the IC literature yielded only two New Zealand based studies (Miller  Whiting, 2005; Wong  Gardner, 2005). Further, no studies to date have addressed intellectual capital reporting by local governments in either New Zealand or internationally. This study aims to fill this gap through the development of an intellectual capital disclosure model that could be applied to local authorities.  The research describes and explains the development of a disclosure index used to measure the extent and quality of current intellectual capital disclosure by local authorities in New Zealand. The index was developed through a consultative process with a panel of local government stakeholders which was used to establish the weightings for each item. The final index comprised 26 items divided into three categories: internal capital, external capital and human capital. The 2004/2005 annual reports of 82 New Zealand local authorities were scored for extent and quality of disclosure against the index. The results indicate that intellectual capital reporting by local authorities is varied. Manukau City Council scored the achieved the highest overall score (76%) out of the 82 reports analysed while Whakatane District Council scored the lowest with 33%. The most reported items were joint ventures/business collaborations and management processes. The least reported items were intellectual property and licensing agreements. The most reported category of intellectual capital was internal capital, followed by external capital. The least reported category was human capital. The findings indicate a number of areas of reporting that could be improved in order to meet with stakeholder disclosure expectations. In the internal capital category, intellectual property disclosures could be improved. In the external capital category disclosure concerning ratepayer demographics and licensing agreements could be improved. In the human capital category, disclosure of most items could be improved, in particular, entrepreneurial innovativeness and vocational qualifications.  The study provided an insight into the current level and quality of intellectual capital disclosure by the NZ local government sector. The results indicated that local authorities are disclosing some aspects of intellectual capital in their annual report, however there is no consistent reporting framework, and many areas of IC disclosures are not meeting stakeholder expectations. More research is needed in the area of intellectual capital reporting in the public sector. This study provides a preliminary framework which can be used by local authorities to enhance intellectual capital disclosures in their annual reports.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intellectual capital</field><field name="subject">local government</field><field name="subject">content analysis</field><field name="subject">disclosure</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2382</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Submerged Thin Plate Weirs With Unequal Upstream and Downstream Beds</field><field name="creator">Nalder, Guinevere Vivianne</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a short study to examine the behaviour of submerged flow over a thin plate weir with differing upstream and downstream bed levels i.e. an unequal bed weir as opposed to an equal bed weir where the upstream and downstream beds are at the same level.  As submerged weir flow is a function of downstream conditions, it was thought that a lower downstream bed would make submerged flow over the weir easier, This is turn suggested that; 	The shape of the upstream head (Hu) vs downstream head (Hd) graph would change, being initially more steep in the unequal bed case. 	The Froude Number of the approaching flow would be lower for the unequal bed weir than for an equal bed weir at the same submergence. 	Using one of the existing submerged flow formula would lead to an erroneous calculated value.  A series of measurements was done on two model weirs of different sizes subject to successive levels of submergence. Analysis of the readings of upstream and downstream heads indicated that the difference in bed levels was significant and the three effects above were noted.  The work also suggested a new form of equation to calculate flow over a submerged weir. This was looked at briefly.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thin plate weirs</field><field name="subject">submerged weirs</field><field name="subject">weir discharge formulas</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2383</field></doc></add>
